Document storage template

For each document, please copy the relevant attributes into the template below. The template is split into four sections
  1. Violence tag: one of the 12 forms of school violence
  2. Document title: the title of the document
  3. Document text: the text body of the document
  4. Search tags: supplemental tags to facilitate document search and retrieval

Additional notes:
  - If not applicable, please leave the section blank but leave the asterisks in place (e.g., if no search tags required)
  - If multiple tags are applicable, please enter each tag on a new line
  - Please delete the brackets when filling in the template
