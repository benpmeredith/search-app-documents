Although the young people who engage in violence do not intend the outcome, they nevertheless suffer the consequenceseither the harm that comes from being victimized or the punishment that comes from being the aggressor. This type of violence is extensive. An estimated 16 percent of all high school students in this country have been in one or more physical fights on school property in the course of a year.1 Victimization rates for simple assault are highest among young people ages 12 to 19.2 The problem is in-creasing, because while some types of violent crime are declining, the risk of being a victim of this type of crime has risen since the mid-1980s among juve-niles ages 12 to 17. The same is true with the more serious offense of aggravated as-sault; juvenile arrests for this offense are projected to rise.3\r\rAggravated assault and even homicide, which include young people as victims and offenders, often result from events similar to those triggering less serious offensestransactions over seemingly trivial matters, occurring between people\r\r\rwho know each other. This study of vio-lent incidents among middle and high school students focused not only on the types and frequency of these incidents but also on their dynamicsthe locations, the opening moves, the relationship be-tween disputants, the goals and justifica-tions of the aggressor, the role of third parties, and other factors.\r\rThe violent incidents were analyzed to create general models of the sequence or pattern of events in the interactions among disputants. The analysis confirmed that the opening moves involved such actions as minor slights and teasing, and the inci-dents took place largely among young people who knew each other. What is perhaps most troubling is the finding that the students violent behavior did not stem from lack of values. Rather, it was grounded in a well-developed set of val-ues that holds such behavior to be a justi-fiable, commonsense way to achieve certain goals.\r\rInformation about the typical steps that culminate in violent incidents, the ration-ales for those incidents, the most common locations where the incidents take place, and how the disputants and others are re-\r\r", "search_tags": ["disrupts classroom activities", "does poorly in school", "frequently gets into fights with other children at school (uncontrollable anger,", "impulsive and chronic hitting, intimidating and bullying behavior)", "reacts to disappointments, criticism, or teasing with extreme and intense anger, blame, or revenge", "watches many violent television shows and movies or plays a lot of violent games", "has few friends and is often rejected by other children because of his or her behavior", "makes friends with other children known to be unruly or aggressive"]}, "drug use1.txt": {"violence_tags": ["drug use", "sexual harassment", "vandalism", "gang activities", "stealing", "weapons use", "making threats"], "document_text": "\rThe decade between 1983 and 1993 was marked by an unprecedented surge of violence, often lethal violence, among young people in the United States. For millions of youths and their families, a period of life that should have been distinguished by good health and great promise was instead marred by injuries, disability, and death (Cook & Laub, 1998). This epidemic of violence not only left lasting scars on victims, perpetrators, and their families and friends, it also wounded communities and, in ways not yet fully understood, the country as a whole.\rSince 1993, the peak year of the epidemic, there have been some encouraging signs that youth violence is declining. Three important indicators of violent behavior -- arrest records, victimization data, and hospital emergency room records -- have shown significant downward trends nationally. These official records reveal only a small part of the picture, however.\rA fourth key indicator of violence -- confidential reports by youths themselves -- reveals that the proportion of young people who acknowledge having committed serious, potentially lethal acts of physical violence has remained level since the peak of the epidemic. In 1999, for instance, there were 104,000 arrests of persons under age 18 for robbery, forcible rape, aggravated assault, or homicide (Snyder, 2000); of those arrests, 1,400 were for homicides perpetrated by adolescents (Snyder, 2000) and, occasionally, even younger children (Snyder & Sickmund, 1999). Yet in any given year in the late 1990s, at least 10 times as many youths reported that they had engaged in some form of violent behavior that could have seriously injured or killed another person.\rThe high prevalence of violent behavior reported by adolescents underscores the importance of this report at this time.\rAmericans cannot afford to become complacent. Even though youth violence is less lethal today than it was in 1993, the percentage of adolescents involved in violent behavior remains alarmingly high. The epidemic of lethal violence that swept the United States was fueled in large part by easy access to weapons, notably firearms -- and youths' self-reports of violence indicate that the potential for a resurgence of lethal violence exists. Yet viewing homicide as a barometer of all youth violence can be quite misleading. Similarly, judging the success of violence prevention efforts solely on the basis of reductions in homicides can be unwise. trouble paying attention and concentrating \r\rdisrupts classroom activities \r\rdoes poorly in school \r\rfrequently gets into fights with other children at school (uncontrollable anger, \rimpulsive and chronic hitting, intimidating and bullying behavior) \r\rreacts to disappointments, criticism, or teasing with extreme and intense anger, \rblame, or revenge \r\rwatches many violent television shows and movies or plays a lot of violent games \r\r\rThis report, the first Surgeon General's report on youth violence in the United States, summarizes an extensive body of research and seeks to clarify seemingly contradictory trends, such as the discrepancies noted above between official records of youth violence and young people's self-reports of violent behaviors. It describes research identifying and clarifying the factors that increase the risk, or statistical probability, that a young person will become violent, as well as studies that have begun to identify developmental pathways that may lead a young person into a violent lifestyle. The report also explores the less well developed research area of factors that seem to protect youths from viewing violence as an acceptable -- or inevitable -- way of approaching or responding to life events. Finally, the report reviews research on the effectiveness of specific strategies and programs designed to reduce and prevent youth violence.\rAs these topics suggest, the key to preventing a great deal of violence is understanding where and when it occurs, determining what causes it, and scientifically documenting which of many strategies for prevention and intervention are truly effective. This state-of-the-science report summarizes progress toward those goals.\rThe most important conclusion of the report is that the United States is well past the \"nothing works\" era with respect to reducing and preventing youth violence. Less than 10 years ago, many observers projected an inexorably rising tide of violence; the recent, marked reductions in arrests of young perpetrators and in victimization reports appear to belie those dire predictions. We possess the knowledge and tools needed to reduce or even prevent much of the most serious youth violence. Scientists from many disciplines, working in a variety of settings with public and private agencies, are generating needed information and putting it to use in designing, testing, and evaluating intervention programs.\rThe most urgent need now is a national resolve to confront the problem of youth violence systematically, using research-based approaches, and to correct damaging myths and stereotypes that interfere with the task at hand. This report is designed to help meet that need.\rThe report makes it clear that after years of effort and massive expenditures of public and private resources, the search for solutions to the problem of youth violence remains an enormous challenge (Lipton et al., 1975; Sechrest et al., 1979). Some traditional as well as seemingly innovative approaches to reducing and preventing youth violence have failed to deliver on their promise, and successful approaches are often eclipsed by random violent events such as the recent school shootings that have occurred in communities throughout the country.\rYouth violence is a high-visibility, high-priority concern in every sector of U.S. society. We have come to understand that young people in every community are involved in violence, whether the community is a small town or central city, a neatly groomed suburb, or an isolated rural region. Although male adolescents, particularly those from minority groups, are disproportionately arrested for violent crimes, self-reports indicate that differences \r", "search_tags": ["gun owner family", "trouble paying attention and concentrating", "disrupts classroom activities", "does poorly in school", "frequently gets into fights with other children at school (uncontrollable anger,", "impulsive and chronic hitting, intimidating and bullying behavior)", "reacts to disappointments, criticism, or teasing with extreme and intense anger, blame, or revenge", "watches many violent television shows and movies or plays a lot of violent games", "has few friends and is often rejected by other children because of his or her behavior", "makes friends with other children known to be unruly or aggressive", "consistently does not listen to adults", "not sensitive to the feelings of others", "cruel or violent toward pets or other animals", "easily frustrated", "a victim of violence and/or abuse", "has feelings of being picked on or persecuted", "expresses violence in writings and/or drawings"]}, "CDC Special Supplement.txt": {"violence_tags": ["making threats", "intimidation", "ostracizing"], "document_text": "\rCDC Special Supplement: Issues, Evidence and Public Health Implications of Protective Factors for Youth Violence Perpetration\rmaking threats, intimidation, ostracizing\r\rRecommend on Facebook\rTweet\r\rtarget anchor for return to top feature in VP1\rbody \rHomicide continues to be the second leading cause of death for youth ages 15-24, and the leading cause of death for African American youth. More than 700,000 young people ages 10 to 24 were treated in emergency departments in 2010 for injuries sustained due to violence. But responding to violence after it happens is only part of the solution. We must prevent youth violence before it begins. In addition, most youth, even those living in high risk situations, are not violent and more must be learned about the factors that are helping youth, protecting them from engaging in violent behavior so that others can benefit. One critical step is a better understanding of the factors that protect youth from engaging in violence. To inform prevention efforts that enhance protective influences, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) National Center for Injury Prevention and Control convened a panel with expertise in youth development, violence prevention, and analytic methods.\rThis special supplement of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Protective Factors for Youth Violence Perpetration Issues, Evidence, and Public Health Implications*, is the first publication developed from the panels work.

This chapter looks closely at childhood and\r\radolescence as critical periods of development to trace how violence unfolds -- its onset,\r\rduration, and continuity into adulthood. It also examines violence in relation to other risky\r\rbehaviors that emerge in adolescence.\r\r\rThe dynamics of youth violence are best understood from a developmental perspective, which\r\rrecognizes that patterns of behavior change over the life course. Adolescence is a time of\r\rtumultuous change and vulnerability, which can include an increase in the frequency and means\r\rof expression of violence and other risky behaviors. Understanding when and under what\r\rcircumstances violent behavior typically occurs helps researchers craft interventions that target\r\rthose critical points in development.\r\r\rOur understanding of developmental patterns depends in large part on longitudinal studies, which\r\rtrack the same group of individuals over long periods of time, sometimes a decade or more. Four\r\rmajor longitudinal studies are described in this chapter. They add new dimensions to the\r\rsurveillance statistics presented in Chapter 2, and they provide essential background for Chapter\r\r4, which deals with why young people become involved in violence.\r\r\rEarly- and Late-Onset Trajectories\r\r\rLongitudinal research has detected two prominent developmental trajectories for the emergence\r\rof youth violence, one characterized by an early onset of violence and one by a late onset.\r\rChildren who commit their first serious violent act before puberty are in the early-onset group,\r\rwhereas youths who do not become violent until adolesence are in the late-onset group. While\r\rother developmental trajectories have been identified (D'Unger et al., 1998; Nagin & Tremblay,\r\r1999), this report focuses on the early- and late-onset trajectories because they are recognized by\r\rmost researchers, they debunk the myth that all serious violent offenders can be identified in\r\rearly childhood, and they have strikingly different implications for prevention.\r\r\rIn the early-onset trajectory, problem behavior that begins in early childhood gradually escalates\r\rto more violent behavior, culminating in serious violence before adolescence. A child's first\r\rserious violent act may have been officially recorded, or it may have been reported by the child\r\rto researchers in a confidential survey. The early-onset group, in contrast to the late-onset group,\r\ris characterized by higher rates of offending and more serious offenses in adolescence, as well as\r\rby greater persistence of violence from adolescence into adulthood (reviewed in Stattin &\r\rMagnusson, 1996, and Tolan & Gorman-Smith, 1998). The National Youth Survey shows that\r\rnearly 13 percent of male adolescents in the early-onset trajectory engaged in violence for two or\r\rmore years, compared to only 2.5 percent in the late-onset trajectory (Tolan & Gorman-Smith,\r\r1998).\r\r\rBetween 20 and 45 percent of boys who are serious violent offenders by age 16 or 17 initiated\r\rtheir violence in childhood (D'Unger et al., 1998; Elliott et al., 1986; Huizinga et al., 1995; Nagin\r\n& Tremblay, 1999; Patterson & Yoerger, 1997; Stattin & Magnusson, 1996). A higher percentage\r\rof girls who were serious violent offenders by age 16 or 17 (45 to 69 percent) were violent in\r\rchildhood (Elliott et al., 1986; Huizinga et al., 1995). This means that most violent youths begin1\r\rtheir violent behavior during adolescence. However, the youths who commit most of the violent\r\racts, who commit the most serious violent acts, and who continue their violent behavior beyond\r\radolescence begin during childhood (Loeber et al., 1998; Moffitt, 1993; Tolan, 1987; Tolan &\r\rGorman-Smith, 1998).\r\r\rThe greater prevalence of late-onset youth violence refutes the myth that all serious violent\r\roffenders can be identified in early childhood. In fact, the majority of young people who become\r\rviolent show little or no evidence of childhood behavioral disorders, high levels of aggression, or\r\rproblem behaviors -- all predictors of later violence.\r\r\rThe implications of these findings for prevention are clear: Programs are needed to address both\r\rearly- and late-onset violence. Targeting prevention programs solely to younger children with\r\rproblem behavior misses over half of the children who will eventually become serious violent\r\roffenders, although universal prevention programs in childhood may be effective in preventing\r\rlate-onset violence (see Chapters 4 and 6).\r\r\rOnset and Prevalence of Serious Violence\r\reasily frustrated \r\ra victim of violence and/or abuse \r\rhas feelings of being picked on or persecuted \r\rexpresses violence in writings and/or drawings \r\rhas a history of violent and aggressive behavior \rmakes suicidal comments or attempts \r\rMuch of what is known about the onset, prevalence, and other characteristics of serious violence\r\rduring the adolescent years comes from four important longitudinal surveys. The only nationally\r\rrepresentative one is the National Youth Survey (NYS), an ongoing study of 1,725 youths age 11\r\rto 17 in 1976, when the survey began (Elliott, 1994). These youths have been tracked by\r\rresearchers for more than two decades and through nine waves, or points at which they were\r\rinterviewed and/or their official records were sought to corroborate self-reported violence.2\r\r\rThe other three longitudinal studies cited here are city surveys sponsored by the U.S. Office of\r\rJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and the National Institutes of Health (Huizinga et\r\ral., 1995; Thornberry et al., 1995). Beginning in 1988, three teams of researchers began to3\r\rinterview 4,500 youths age 7 to 15 in three cities -- Denver, Pittsburgh, and Rochester (New\r\rYork). These youths were monitored at different points from 1988 to 1994. Each sample\r\rdisproportionately represents youths at high risk of delinquency to ensure that it is large enough\r\rto draw valid conclusions about delinquency and violence, but each also uses weighting\r\rprocedures to yield locally representative estimates. The estimates presented here are based on\r\rweighted data.\r\r\rThese four surveys define serious violence as aggravated assault, robbery, gang fights, or rape;\r\ran individual is labeled a serious violent offender if he or she reports committing any one or\r\rmore of these offenses. Gang fights are included because follow-up information on these fights4\r\rreveals that most of them involve injury serious enough to require medical attention (Elliott,\r\r1994).\r\r\rOnly the NYS reports the hazard rate for serious violence during the first two decades of life.5\r\rThe hazard rate is the proportion of persons who initiate serious violence at a given age. Serious\r\rviolence begins mostly between the ages of 12 and 20 (Figure 3-1). In fact, 85 percent of people\r\rwho become involved in serious violence by age 27 report that their first act occurred between\r\rage 12 and 20. The onset of serious violence is negligible after age 23 and before age 10 (only\r\n0.2 percent of arrests for serious violent crime in 1997 involved a child under age 10 [Maguire &\r\rPastore, 1999]).\r\r\r          Figure\r\r\r          Figure 3-1. Hazard rate for initiating serious violence, by age,\r\r          National Youth Survey. Source: Elliott, 1994. 95%\r\r            confidence intervals are all less than (more...)\r\r\r\rThe peak age of onset is 16, when about 5 percent of male adolescents report their first act of\r\rserious violence. The age of onset peaks somewhat later for white males (age 18) than for\r\rAfrican American males (age 15). The hazard rate at the peak age also varies somewhat by\r\rrace/ethnicity. It is lower for white males (5 percent) than for African American males (8\r\rpercent) (Elliott, 2000a). A similar finding is reported in the Pittsburgh Youth Survey (Huizinga\r\ret al., 1995). No comparable hazard rates have been published for female youths, but other6\r\rstudies have found that they are generally lower.7\r\r\rAge-specific prevalence -- that is, the proportion of youths at any given age who report having\r\rcommitted at least one serious violent act -- is also greatest in the second decade of life. The\r\rNYS and the three city surveys find that, broadly speaking, age-specific prevalence among male\r\ryouths ranges from about 8 to 20 percent between the ages of 12 and 20 (Figure 3-2). Among\r\rfemales, it ranges from 1 to 18 percent (Table 3-1). There is some variability across surveys,\r\rhowever. In general, the NYS has lower rates than the three city surveys, reflecting the difference\r\rbetween a national sample and local samples drawn from urban areas. The differences may also\r\rreflect the timing of the studies. NYS estimates cover the years 1976 to 1986, whereas the three\r\rcity surveys cover the years 1986 or 1988 to 1994, the peak years of the violence epidemic (see\r\rChapter 2). Nevertheless, the estimates for age 17 across these longitudinal surveys are in the\r\rsame range as those for high school seniors in the Monitoring the Future survey (see Chapter 2).\r\r\r          Figure\r\r\r          Figure 3-2. Prevalence of serious violence among male\r\r          youths, by age: four longitudinal surveys. Sources: Denver\r\r          Youth Survey (DYS), Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS),\r\r          Rochester Youth (more...)\r\r\r          Table\r\r\r          Table 3-1. Prevalence of serious violence by age, sex, and\r\r            race/ethnicity: four longitudinal surveys.\r\r\r\rAnother key difference between the national and city surveys is the maturation effect, or the age\r\rat which serious violence begins to decline sharply during the transition to adulthood. The NYS\r\rshows a decline in age-specific prevalence starting in the late teen years and a steep drop-off by\r\rage 20. In contrast, the city surveys, which were begun more recently, do not show a decline in\r\rthe late teen years (Huizinga et al., 1995), and they have not yet published data on prevalence in\r\rearly adulthood. Therefore, it is too soon to tell whether or at what age more recent groups of\r\ryouths will mature out of violence. It is possible that young people are staying violent longer.\r\nSome important differences in age-specific prevalence by sex have emerged from the data (Table\r\r3-1). Female adolescents have lower rates of serious violence throughout the second decade. For\r\rthe NYS and Denver surveys, rates at age 12 are about twice as high for boys as for girls.\r\rBetween age 12 and 15 in Rochester, the rates are fairly similar. For all studies, the rates for\r\rfemales at age 17 are about one-quarter the rates for males. In addition, the peak age of serious\r\rviolent offending occurs a few years earlier among females, and their maturation out of serious\r\rviolence is both earlier and steeper than males'.\r\r\rAge-specific prevalence also varies by race/ethnicity (Table 3-1). The NYS finds a significant\r\rracial gap between ages 14 and 17, when rates for African American youths are 36 to 50 percent\r\rhigher than those for white youths. The city surveys show an even wider gap between African\r\rAmerican and white youths (Huizinga et al., 1995). Rates among Hispanic youths, reported only\r\rfor Denver and Rochester, are similar to or lower than those reported by African American\r\ryouths in these cities. The prevalence reported by Hispanic youths ranges from 6 to 12 percent in\r\rDenver and about 10 to 20 percent in Rochester. Possible reasons for developmental differences\r\rby sex, race, and ethnicity are discussed in Chapter 4. None of these comparisons takes into\r\raccount the effects of poverty, education, housing, or other environmental conditions.\r\r\rCumulative Prevalence\r\r\rCumulative prevalence refers to the proportion of youths at any particular age who have ever\r\rcommitted a serious violent offense. As a measure of violence, it tends to equalize rather than8\r\rmagnify differences across populations because it counts youths only once, regardless of when or\r\rhow often they engaged in violent acts.\r\r\rThe most striking feature of the cumulative prevalence is its sheer magnitude: About 30 to 40\r\rpercent of male and 16 to 32 percent of female youths have committed a serious violent offense\r\rby age 17 (Figure 3-3). Although these rates are only slightly higher than those found in\r\rinternational studies, the represent a more serious set of offenses (Junger-Tas et al., 1994).\r\r\r\r          Figure\r\r\r          Figure 3-3. Cumulative prevalence of serious violence, by\r\r          age, sex, and race: four longitudinal surveys. Sources:\r\r          National Youth Survey (NYS), 1976-1993 (Elliott, 1994);\r\r          Rochester Youth (more...)\r\r\r\rThe cumulative prevalence of youth violence is generally consistent across the four surveys. For\r\rmale youths, the NYS shows it rising to about 40 percent and then leveling off beyond age 22. In\r\rthe city surveys, it reaches more than 40 percent of male and 32 percent of female youths by age\r\r17. Not only is the rise in cumulative prevalence by age 17 steeper in the city surveys, the\r\rmagnitude is substantially higher.\r\r\rThese differences between a nationally representative sample and city samples are to be\r\rexpected. The timing of the surveys may also explain some of the differences. For example, 17-\r\ryear-olds in the NYS were interviewed at some point between 1976 and 1982, whereas 17-year-\r\rolds in the city surveys were interviewed at some point between 1988 and 1994, the era during\r\rwhich the self-reported prevalence of serious youth violence increased somewhat (see Chapter\r\r2).\r\nThere is a pronounced difference in cumulative prevalence by sex. Among 17-year-olds, the\r\rDenver survey found a cumulative prevalence of 16 percent for female youths and 43 percent for\r\rmale youths, whereas the Rochester survey showed 32 percent and 40 percent, respectively. Data\r\ron cumulative prevalence for females are not available in the Pittsburgh survey or the NYS.9\r\r\rOn the other hand, there are few differences in cumulative prevalence by race over the teen\r\ryears, according to the NYS. By age 23, white males had a cumulative prevalence of 38 percent\r\rand African American males had a cumulative prevalence of 45 percent, a difference that is not\r\rstatistically significant (Figure 3-3).\r\r\rRates of Offending and Violent Careers\r\r\rViolent youths commit a remarkably high number of crimes (Tolan & Gorman-Smith, 1998). An\r\ranalysis of NYS data shows that these young people (both male and female) averaged 15.6 rapes,\r\rrobberies, aggravated assaults, or some combination of these crimes over a 16-year period (1976\r\rto 1992) (Elliott, 2000b). What's more, they averaged just over six serious violent offenses each\r\rduring the years in which they were active (Elliott, 2000b). This mean annual rate of offending10\r\ris similar to rates reported in the three city surveys for males (about 5 to 9 serious violent\r\roffenses per year) (Huizinga et al., 1995) but much higher than the rates for females (2 to 4.5 per\r\ryear).\r\r\rIt is noteworthy that the mean annual rate of individual offending appears to be essentially\r\runchanged over the past two decades. This finding is corroborated by a study of trends among\r\rjuvenile offenders processed by a county court system in Arizona (Snyder, 1998) and by an\r\ranalysis of both National Crime Victimization Survey data and arrest records (Snyder &\r\rSickmund, 2000). Finally, the Monitoring the Future survey (see Chapter 2) found no significant\r\rchanges in individual offending rates for robbery or assault with injury between 1983 and\r\r1993.11\r\r\rCareer length has been variously defined as the number of years of active offending, the\r\rmaximum number of consecutive years, or the span between the first and last year during which\r\ra young person meets the criteria for a serious violent offender (Blumstein et al., 1986). There\r\rare relatively few estimates of violent career lengths. In the NYS, the mean career length\r\r(number of years of active violent offending) was 2.6 years. The most frequent career length was\r\r1 year (36.8 percent of serious violent offenders). Three-quarters of these serious violent youths\r\rhad careers lasting 3 years or less, and 15 percent had careers of 5 years or more (Elliott, 2000b).\r\rBased on 5 years of data, the Denver survey reports that 42 percent of serious violent youths\r\rwere active for only 1 year, 22 percent for 2 years, and 31 percent for 3 or more years (Huizinga\r\ret al., 1995).\r\r\rThe typical violent career comprises either a single year of continuous offending or a longer\r\rperiod of intermittent offending. Relatively few violent careers are characterized by years of\r\runinterrupted violence. In Denver, well over half of the careers that lasted three or more years\r\rhad at least one year with no violent offending; three-quarters of those that spanned a 5-year\r\rperiod had an intermittent pattern of offending (Thornberry et al., 1995). Evidence that most\r\rcareers lasting more than 1 year were characterized by intermittent offending also surfaced in the\r\rNYS (Elliott et al., 1986). This intermittent pattern makes it difficult to identify serious violent\r\roffenders with cross-sectional studies or with longitudinal studies that have long periods between\r\ndata collection (Huizinga et al., 1995).\r\r\rIn sum, these studies suggest that in most cases violent careers are relatively short and are\r\rcharacterized by intermittent offending. During active periods, however, most careers are marked\r\rby a high rate of violent offending -- up to 10 offenses per year (Elliott et al., 1986; Thornberry\r\ret al., 1995).\r\r\rDevelopmental Pathway to Violence\r\r\rViolent youths do not usually begin their careers with a serious violent offense. While the\r\rdevelopmental pathway varies, depending on what types of behavior are monitored, studies\r\rgenerally agree that a violent career begins with relatively minor forms of antisocial or\r\rdelinquent behavior. These acts later increase in frequency, seriousness, and variety, often\r\rprogressing to serious violent behavior (Elliott, 1994; Loeber et al., 1998; Moffitt, 1993; Tolan &\r\rGorman-Smith, 1998). Several complex pathways to serious violence have been proposed\r\r(Loeber, 1996; Elliott, 1994).\r\r\rThe NYS suggests that violence escalates over time. Most serious violent youths who engage in\r\rmultiple types of violent behavior begin with aggravated assault, then add a robbery, and finally\r\ra rape. (Rape appears to be the endpoint of the progression, although there were not enough\r\rhomicides in the NYS sample to include homicide in the analysis.) Robbery precedes rape in\r\rover 70 percent of cases in which both acts have been reported, and about 15 percent of serious\r\rviolent offenders in the NYS reported having committed a rape (Elliott, 1994, 2000a). This\r\rsequence must be considered tentative because it is based on a single study.\r\r\rWhen serious violence becomes part of a youth's repertoire of antisocial behavior, it does not\r\rsubstitute for less serious forms of violence; rather, it adds to them and escalates the overall\r\rfrequency of violent acts. Thus, serious violent youths are high-frequency offenders who are\r\rinvolved in many less serious as well as serious offenses. These youths account for a major share\r\rof all criminal behavior, a pattern that is explored more fully in the next section.\r\r\rChronic Violent Offenders\r\r\rA minority of serious violent youths are responsible for the overwhelming majority of serious\r\rviolent crime, a finding supported by numerous self-report and arrest studies (Tolan & Gorman-\r\rSmith, 1998; Tracy & Kempf-Leonard, 1996). In the city surveys, chronic offenders, though\r\rrepresenting less than 20 percent of all serious violent offenders, accounted for 75 to 80 percent\r\rof self-reported violent crimes (Huizinga et al., 1995). NYS data yield similar findings: Chronic\r\roffenders (youths with three or more violent offenses) accounted for 76 percent of all felony\r\rassaults and 89 percent of all robberies reported by offenders in 1980 (Elliott et al., 1989).\r\r\rChronic violent youths may also account for a disproportionate share of all youth crime. The\r\rNYS reveals that in 1980 these serious violent offenders accounted for 79 percent of all felony\r\rtheft, 66 percent of all illegal services (primarily drug selling), and 50 percent of all self-reported\r\rcrime (Elliott et al., 1989). In the Philadelphia Birth Cohort Study, 15 percent of youthful\r\roffenders accounted for 74 percent of all official crime (Tracy & Kempf-Leonard, 1996).\r\r\rAs noted earlier, youths whose violence begins before puberty are more likely to become chronic\r\rviolent offenders (Loeber et al., 1998). In the Rochester survey, 39 percent of children who\r\rinitiated violent behavior by age 9 eventually became chronic offenders, 30 percent of those who\r\ninitiated violence between the ages of 10 and 12 became chronic offenders, and 23 percent of\r\rthose who initiated violence after age 13 became chronic violent offenders. In Denver, 62 percent\r\rof those initiating violence by age 9 and 48 percent of those initiating violence between 10 and\r\r12 became chronic violent offenders. Looking at this another way, 55 percent of all chronic\r\rviolent offenders in Denver came from the early-onset trajectory (Thornberry et al., 1995). While\r\rthe late-onset trajectory involves a substantially larger group of youths, fewer than half of all\r\rchronic offenders come from this group.\r\r\rAlthough most chronic violent offenders in the three city surveys (62 to 77 percent) eventually\r\rhad contact with the police for some offense (though not necessarily a violent offense), one-\r\rquarter to one-third were never arrested (Huizinga et al., 1995). Among those who were arrested\r\rfor some offense, the first contact came well after they had begun their violent careers.\r\rInterventions by the justice system occur too late to prevent such youths from escalating from\r\rless serious offenses to serious violence. Fortunately, it appears that at least half of chronic\r\rviolent offenders can be identified as being at risk in childhood.\r\r\rResearch has found a powerful relationship between membership in a gang and chronic\r\rinvolvement in serious violence (see review in Thornberry, 1998). As noted earlier (see Chapter\r\r2), gang members, a relatively small proportion of the adolescent population, commit the\r\rmajority of serious youth violence (see Spergel, 1990, and Thornberry, 1998, for reviews).\r\r\rSuperpredators?\r\r\rBetween 1983 and 1993, adolescents were committing homicide at dramatically higher rates than\r\rin previous years (see Chapter 2). Did those youths represent a new breed of frequent, vicious,\r\rremorseless killers? Did the character of violent youths change during that time -- and is it still\r\rdifferent today (Bennett et al., 1996)? The answer seems to be no, for several reasons.\r\r\rFirst, the increase in homicides was similar across all age groups (see Chapter 2). This suggests\r\rthat it resulted from a relatively sudden change in the environment that affected all youths rather\r\rthan from a gradual change in the socialization process, which would have led to progressively\r\rmore vicious youths with each succeeding age group. Second, the increase in homicides was\r\rhighly specific to certain youths -- namely, African American males (Zimring, 1998); moreover,\r\rit did not take place among females (see Chapter 2). Third, during the violence epidemic, there\r\rwas a decline in family members killed by youths (Cook & Laub, 1998).\r\r\rFourth, a new breed of superpredators should have resulted in more burglaries, auto thefts, and\r\rlarcenies, but no such increases occurred (Cook & Laub, 1998). It should also have resulted in\r\rmore homicides involving knives and other weapons, but this did not occur (Zimring, 1998).\r\rFifth, there was no evidence that individual rates of serious violent crime changed during the\r\repidemic. More youths were involved, but the average number of offenses committed by each\r\rdid not change. Finally, there may be anecdotal evidence that today's youths show less remorse\r\rfor their violence, but this has not been substantiated by research.\r\r\rIn sum, the epidemic of violence from 1983 to 1993 does not seem to have resulted from a basic\r\rchange in the offending rates and viciousness of young offenders. Rather, it resulted primarily\r\rfrom a relatively sudden change in the social environment -- the introduction of guns into violent\r\rexchanges among youths. The violence epidemic was, in essence, the result of a change in the\r\rpresence and type of weapon used, which increased the lethality of violent incidents (Wintemute,\r\n2000).\r\r\rCo-occurring Problem Behaviors\r\r\rSerious violence is accompanied by a wide range of other problem behaviors, including property\r\rcrimes, substance use, gun ownership, dropping out of school, early sexual activity, and reckless\r\rdriving. The co-occurrence of these problem behaviors has been borne out by numerous national\r\rand local studies (see reviews in Elliott, 1993; Huizinga & Jakob-Chen, 1998; Tolan & Gorman-\r\rSmith, 1998).\r\r\rThe overlap is greatest between serious violence and other forms of crime. In the three city\r\rsurveys, 82 to 92 percent of chronic violent youths were involved in property crimes, 71 to 82\r\rpercent in public disorder crimes, and 26 to 45 percent in selling drugs (Huizinga et al., 1995).\r\rVery similar rates were found in the NYS (Elliott et al., 1989). Rates of co-occurrence were\r\rmuch higher among serious violent youths than among less violent youths.\r\r\rSubstance use and abuse are a central feature of a violent lifestyle (Dembo et al., 1991; Elliott,\r\r1994; Elliott et al., 1989; Esbensen & Huizinga, 1991; Fagan, 1993; Johnson et al., 1991). In the\r\rDenver survey, for example, about 58 percent of serious violent offenders were alcohol users and\r\r34 percent were marijuana users. The prevalence and frequency of use were much lower in\r\ryouths who were not seriously violent (Huizinga & Jakob-Chen, 1998). The NYS indicates that\r\r94 percent of serious violent youths in 1980 were using alcohol, 85 percent were using\r\rmarijuana, and 55 percent were using several illicit drugs. Over half (55 percent) were abusing\r\rdrugs -- that is, they reported health or relationship problems, or both, associated with their drug\r\ruse (Elliott et al., 1989).\r\r\rSimilar findings regarding the overlap of substance use and serious violence hold for the\r\rRochester study (Thornberry et al., 1995). Moreover, chronic violent youths in Rochester and\r\rviolent youths in the NYS had higher rates of dropping out of school, gun ownership and use,\r\rteenage sexual activity and parenthood, tobacco use, driving under the influence of alcohol or\r\rdrugs, and gang membership than nonserious offenders or nonoffenders (Elliott, 1993;\r\rThornberry et al., 1995).\r\r\rIn sum, these studies show that a sizable proportion of serious violent youths have co-occurring\r\rproblem behaviors -- and at rates significantly higher than those of their less violent counterparts.\r\rHowever, by no means all serious violent youths or even all chronic violent youths have co-\r\roccurring problems. Moreover, not all youths with problem behaviors are seriously violent. The\r\rfact that serious violence and problem behaviors tend to occur together does not necessarily\r\rmean that one causes the other (see Chapter 4) (Elliott, 1993; Reiss & Roth, 1993).\r\r\rViolence and Mental Health\r\r\rThe relationship between violence and mental health has been studied more intensively in adults\r\rthan in young people. An earlier U.S. Surgeon General's report on mental health, after weighing\r\rthe evidence, emphasized that the contribution of mental disorders to overall violence in the\r\rUnited States is very small. In fact, public fear is out of proportion to the actual risk of violence,\r\rwhich contributes to the stigmatizing of people with severe mental disorders (Link et al., 1999).\r\rEven though the risk of violence is low overall, it is greatest for adults with serious mental\r\rdisorders who also abuse substances (Steadman et al., 1998; Swanson, 1994).\r\nAlthough violence is relatively widespread among adolescents, few studies have been undertaken\r\ron the co-occurrence of violence and mental health problems or disorders among U.S.\r\radolescents. Such population-based studies are important because they avoid the bias inherent in\r\rsurveying hospitalized patients or convicted offenders.\r\r\rBoth the NYS and the Denver survey examine the co-occurrence of serious violence and mental\r\rhealth problems. In the NYS, 28 percent of serious offenders age 11 to 17 were classified as\r\rhaving mental health problems, compared to 13 to 14 percent of nonserious delinquent youths\r\rand 9 percent of nonoffenders. Youths were classified as having mental health problems on the\r\rbasis of their responses to questions about emotional problems, social isolation, and feelings of\r\rloneliness (Elliott et al., 1989). (The questions were not designed to arrive at a diagnosis of a\r\rmental disorder.) Serious violent offenders were more likely than either nonserious offenders or\r\rnonoffenders to report having these types of mental health problems.\r\r\rIn the Denver study, serious violent youths were found to have higher rates of psychological\r\rproblems, based on parents' responses to the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach & Edelbrock,\r\r1983). These problems included externalizing and internalizing behavior, depression,\r\runcommunicativeness, obsessive-compulsive behavior, hyperactivity, social withdrawal, and\r\raggressiveness. The rates at which most of these problems occurred in serious offenders were no\r\rdifferent from the rates at which they occurred in nonviolent delinquent youths; however, rates in\r\rnondelinquent youths were lower. Thus, delinquent youths in general were more likely to have\r\rpsychological problems than nondelinquent youths (Huizinga & Jakob-Chen, 1998).\r\r\rTwo problems were linked directly to violent behavior -- externalizing symptoms and aggressive\r\rbehavior. Approximately half of all serious violent offenders display these problems, although\r\rthe link with externalizing behaviors is statistically significant only for boys. In addition, parents\r\rof violent offenders report seeking help for mental health problems more often than parents of\r\rnondelinquent or nonviolent delinquent youths. These parents did not go to mental health\r\rprofessionals or school counselors; rather, they sought the advice of friends, relatives, and\r\rspiritual leaders (ministers, rabbis, or priests). A similar finding is reported in the Pittsburgh\r\rstudy (Stouthamer-Loeber & Thomas, 1992).\r\r\rThe Denver study found no differences between the self-esteem of serious violent offenders and\r\rnonviolent offenders or nonoffenders (Huizinga & Jakob-Chen, 1998). In general, there is little\r\revidence that low self-esteem causes violence or that violent offenders have low self-esteem. On\r\rthe contrary, the evidence is more consistent with the position that high self-esteem and threats to\r\rhigh esteem lead to violence (Baumeister et al., 1996). This has important implications for\r\rtreatment and intervention programs and the use of esteem-building activities in these programs.\r\r\rA population-based study in New Zealand found that in young adulthood (age 21), serious\r\rviolent offenders are more likely than nonoffenders to exhibit substance dependence disorders,\r\rschizophrenia-spectrum disorders, or both (Arseneault et al., 2000). These New Zealand12\r\rfindings are consistent with the studies of U.S. adults showing that the greatest risk of violence\r\rstems from the combination of serious mental disorder and substance dependence. However,\r\rabout 10 percent of serious violent offenders in the New Zealand study exhibited13\r\rschizophrenia-spectrum disorders without substance dependence or other psychiatric conditions.\r\rThe researchers concluded that while the contribution of serious mental illness to violence in\r\ryoung adults remains small, it may be slightly higher than it is in adults. One possible reason for\r\nthe difference is that the overwhelming majority of young adults with mental disorders in the\r\rNew Zealand study had not been treated or hospitalized within the previous year.\r\r\rAnother recent community-based study found a link between personality disorders (a group of\r\rsevere mental disorders) and violence. Adolescents with personality disorders, as determined14\r\rby diagnostic interviews, were more likely than other adolescents to commit violent acts such as\r\rassault with injury and robbery (Johnson et al., 2000). For example, about 36 percent of\r\radolescents with personality disorders versus 16 percent without the disorders committed a\r\rviolent act against others during adolescence. The relationship between personality disorders15\r\rand violence remained after taking many factors into account, including co-occurring depression,\r\ranxiety, and substance disorders. Only a few adolescents (13 percent) with personality disorders\r\rhad received mental health services during the previous year (Johnston, personal communication,\r\r2000).\r\r\rThus, there is some evidence of a relationship between serious mental disorders and violence in\r\radolescents or young adults in the general population. Young people with serious mental\r\rdisorders may be at risk of becoming violent if they also abuse substances or if they have not\r\rreceived treatment for their mental disorder. More research is needed to understand the\r\rrelationship between serious youth violence and mental illness.\r\r\rOffending and Victimization\r\r\rViolent offenders are frequently victims of violence (Esbensen & Huizinga, 1991; Lauritsen et\r\ral., 1991; Sampson & Lauritsen, 1990, 1994). Data from the NYS reveal that victimization is\r\rhighest among African Americans, males, and frequent offenders (Lauritsen et al., 1991). In\r\raddition, youths who report abusing drugs and alcohol, hanging out with delinquent peers, and\r\rparticipating in social activities with little adult supervision are at greater risk of being victims of\r\rviolence (Gottfredson, 1984; Lauritsen et al., 1991; Sampson & Lauritsen, 1990). A delinquent\r\rlifestyle greatly increases the likelihood of being a victim and appears to account for some of the\r\rdisparities observed in offending and victimization by race/ethnicity and sex. The Denver survey\r\rshows that 42 percent of serious violent offenders are also victims of violence (Huizinga &\r\rJakob-Chen, 1998), with higher rates among male offenders than female offenders.\r\r\rThere are many reasons for the overlap between offending and victimization. Perhaps the most\r\rcommon is that the offender is injured by the intended target -- either during the offense or later,\r\rin retaliation. Another reason is that offenders tend to live in more violent environments or their\r\rlifestyles take them into high-risk environments. The predictive relationship between\r\rvictimization and offending, as well as the relationship with early child abuse, is discussed in\r\rChapter 4.\r\r\rTransition to Adulthood\r\r\rThe transition from adolescence to adulthood features a fairly abrupt discontinuation of serious\r\rviolence, at least according to the NYS. Rates of onset and age-specific prevalence show\r\rdramatic declines, and the cumulative prevalence levels off, as discussed above. Only about 20\r\rpercent of serious violent offenders continue their violent careers into their twenties (Elliott,\r\r1994).\r\r\rWhile there are no differences by sex in the apparent termination of violent offending, there are\r\nsignificant differences by race. Twice as many African American as white youths continue their\r\rviolent behavior into the adult years (Elliott, 1994). Preliminary analyses suggest that cessation\r\rof offending is related to having a stable job and a stable intimate relationship.\r\r\rBy 1992, the most recent year for which data are available, many people monitored by the NYS\r\rhad reached their late twenties and early thirties. There is virtually no published information\r\rabout what patterns of violence may have continued into their adult years. The more recent city\r\rsurveys have published age-specific and cumulative prevalence findings only up to age 19, but\r\rthese studies are still being conducted. Some evidence from these surveys (Figure 3-2) suggests\r\rthat violent careers are lasting longer, but additional waves of data are needed to verify this trend.\r\r\rUnderstanding the demographics and dynamics of how patterns of serious violence change with\r\rthe transition into adulthood is critical to designing programs that enhance the termination of\r\rviolence.\r\r\rConclusions\r\r\rThe prevalence of serious violence by age 17 is startling. About 30 to 40 percent of male and 15\r\rto 30 percent of female youths report having committed a serious violent offense at some point in\r\rtheir lives. This cumulative prevalence is similar among African American and white males, in\r\rcontrast to other measures of violence, which show racial disparities (see Chapter 2).\r\r\rTwo general onset trajectories emerge from longitudinal studies of youth violence -- an early-\r\ronset trajectory that begins before puberty and a late-onset one that begins in adolescence.\r\rYouths in the early-onset trajectory generally commit more crimes, and more serious crimes, for\r\ra longer time. These young people exhibit a pattern of escalating violence through childhood and\r\radolescence, and frequently into adulthood.\r\r\rMost youths who become violent, however, begin in adolescence. Their late-onset offending is\r\rusually limited to a short period, peaking at about age 16 and dropping off dramatically by age\r\r20. They typically show few signs in childhood that they will become violent later on, laying to\r\rrest the myth that all violent adolescents can be identified in childhood.\r\r\rThe rate of individual offending appears to have remained virtually unchanged, both during and\r\rsince the years of the violence epidemic, which began in 1983 and peaked in 1993. This finding,\r\rtogether with evidence that the epidemic was specific to gun-related violence, challenges the\r\rmyth that the early 1990s produced a generation of superpredators who were more vicious and\r\rwho committed dramatically more crimes than earlier generations of young people. At the same\r\rtime, the finding of a stable individual offending rate indicates that the violence epidemic has not\r\raltogether subsided.\r\r\rSerious violence is frequently part of a lifestyle that includes drugs, guns, precocious sex, and\r\rother risky behaviors. Youths involved in serious violence typically commit many other types of\r\rcrimes and exhibit other problem behaviors, presenting a serious challenge to intervention\r\refforts. Successful interventions must confront not only the violent behavior of these young\r\rpeople, but also their lifestyles, which are teeming with risk.\r\r\rPrevention and intervention programs must also take into account the different patterns of\r\rviolence typical of the early- and late-onset trajectories, as well as the relatively constant rates of\r\rindividual offending. Early childhood programs that target at-risk children and families are\r\ncritical for preventing the onset of a chronic violent career, but programs must also be developed\r\rto combat late-onset violence. The importance of late-onset violence prevention is neither widely\r\rrecognized nor well understood. Substantial numbers of serious violent offenders emerge\r\rseemingly without warning. A comprehensive community prevention strategy must address both\r\ronset patterns and ferret out their respective causes and risk factors.\r\r\rReferences\r\r\r1. Achenbach, T.M & Edelbrock, C.

Reports of nonserious events were not included. This adjustment could not be made for the\r\rfirst 3 years of the NYS, so for those years at least two serious violent offenses were required for a youth to\r\rbe classified as a serious violent offender.\r\r\r5The rates for age 10 and under are based entirely upon retrospective reports and may not be as reliable as\r\rthose for age 11 and older.\r\r\r6The actual hazard rates are not presented, but the investigators note that the rates were higher for African\r\rAmericans between the ages of 12 and 16 (Huizinga et al., 1995).\r\r\r7Using a slightly different definition of serious violent offender (three or more serious violent offenses), the\r\rhazard rate for females peaked at age 14 (1.5 percent    1.0 percent) and dropped by age 17 (0.6 percent   \r\r0.5 percent) (Elliott et al., 1986).\r\r\r8Cumulative prevalence is also known as lifetime prevalence or ever-prevalence to a given age.\r\r\r9The NYS reports an 11 percent cumulative prevalence at age 21 among females who are chronic\r\r(committing three or more offenses per year) serious violent offenders.\r\r\r10Active involvement is defined as any year during which offenders committed one or more serious violent\r\roffenses.\r\r\r11Calculations were done by the senior scientific editor Elliott on the basis of Monitoring the Future\r\rprevalence and frequency data on aggravated assault and robbery contained in the 1991 and 1998\r\rSourcebooks of Criminal Justice Statistics (Flanagan & Maguire, 1992; Maguire & Pastore, 1999).\r\rIndividual offending rates are based on estimated incident rates. For this calculation, frequencies\r\rassociated with categorical scores were as follows: not at all = 0; once = 1; twice = 2; 3 or 4 times = 3.5;\r\rand 5 or more times = 5. Individual offending rates for robbery in both 1983 and 1993 were 1.8. Rates for\r\rassault with injury were 2.3 and 2.6 (not significant). The mean individual offending rate can remain\r\rrelatively constant despite increases in prevalence and incident rates noted in Chapter 2.\r\r\r12This broad category includes individuals who responded \"yes, definitely\" when asked if they had positive\r\rsymptoms of schizophrenia (hallucinations and delusions) and for whom other plausible explanations\r\r(such as major depressive episodes or the influence of alcohol or illicit drugs) could be ruled out. The\r\rclassification of diagnoses was made with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule.\r\r\r13Defined by two or more types of violent offenses (simple assault, aggravated assault, robbery, rape, and\r\rgang fighting) or a conviction.\r\r\r14The personality disorders included in this study were the same disorders (e.g., schizotypal disorder)\r\rstudied by Arseneault et al. (2000).\r\r\r15Included threats to injure others, initiation of physical fights, mugging, robberies, or assaults resulting in\r\rinjury during the past 1 to 4 years or during the individual's lifetime.

It's not. In fact, there's been a very steady downward trend for the past 15 years.\"\nSafer Than Anywhere Else\nResearch by Cornell and others shows that school-age and college-age kids are not only safer but far more secure on school campuses than anywhere else. There's also broad agreement that the zero-tolerance policies popular in some school systems have had little to do with the decrease and may, in fact, have proved to be counterproductive.\nSchool violence in the U.S. reached a peak in 1993, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. That year, there were 42 homicides by students in total, as well as 13 \"serious violent crimes\" \u2014 rape, sexual assault, robbery and aggravated assault \u2014 per 1,000 students at primary and secondary schools. By 2010, the latest figures available, those numbers had decreased to two homicides and four violent crimes per 1,000 students.\nStatistics on violent crimes committed by students at college campuses are harder to come by. But a 2005 study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics took a broader look and found that some 93 percent of all violent crimes against university students ages 18 to 24 occurred off campus.\nHomicides In Schools\nFrom 1993 to 2010, the number of homicides committed at primary and secondary schools by students has steadily shrunk.\n\nEND CLASS=\"GRAPHICWRAPPER\"\nSource: National School Safety Center\nCredit: Julia Ro/NPR\nEND CLASS=\"FOOTER\"\nEND CLASS=\"BUCKET\"\nEND ID=\"RES148760084\" CLASS=\"BUCKETWRAP GRAPHIC MEDIUM\"\nEND CLASS=\"CONTAINER MEDIUM\" ID=\"CON148760686\" PREVIEWTITLE=\"HOMICIDES IN SCHOOLS\"\n\"Not only are rates of school violence going steadily down, but it's clear that schools are the safest place for a student to be,\" says Stephen Brock of California State University, Sacramento, a leading expert on school violence and the author of several books on the subject.\nIt may come as no surprise that the 24-hour news cycle gets much of the blame for perpetuating a false notion about the extent of school violence.\n\"When you hear a news announcer say, 'In an all-too-familiar story' or call these incidents 'epidemic,' I think that's where this impression comes from,\" says Cornell of the University of Virginia.\nThe Case Against Zero Tolerance\nSo why are the nation's schools by and large much safer than they were 15 years ago? Cornell and Brock agree that it's largely a reflection of a decline in all violent crime nationwide, as well as a push in the 1990s for after-school programs that helped keep kids off the streets.\n\"There's been a lot of attention to this problem starting with the Clinton administration, and there have been some very effective initiatives taken at the local level,\" Brock says. \"The schools are doing stuff that works, but that's not something you read about in the newspapers.\"\nOther Violent Crimes\nDuring the same period, the number of on-campus serious violent crimes per 1,000 students \u2014 defined as rape, sexual assault, robbery and aggravated assault \u2014 also fell.\n\nEND CLASS=\"GRAPHICWRAPPER\"\nSource: National Center for Education Statistics\nCredit: Julia Ro/NPR\nEND CLASS=\"FOOTER\"\nEND CLASS=\"BUCKET\"\nEND ID=\"RES148760424\" CLASS=\"BUCKETWRAP GRAPHIC MEDIUM\"\nEND CLASS=\"CONTAINER MEDIUM\" ID=\"CON148760821\" PREVIEWTITLE=\"OTHER VIOLENT CRIMES \"\nOne thing that hasn't worked so well, experts say, is the tough zero-tolerance policies aimed at punishing any infraction of school rules.\nCornell says those policies, which became popular in the 1990s to combat drugs, alcohol and violence in schools, have largely been counterproductive. He cites a study of nearly 1 million students in Texas published last year that linked zero tolerance to a surge in suspensions and to higher dropout rates, especially among minorities.\nWhen it comes to zero-tolerance policies \"there's simply no evidence that they work,\" says Brock, who is co-chairman of a crisis prevention program run by the National Association of School Psychologists.\nInstead, these experts advocate a more flexible \"threat assessment approach,\" which is designed to identify students who might be a risk to others and then intervene to change the behavior.\nSchools that have adopted that approach have shown a marked decrease in suspensions and bullying infractions, Cornell says.\n\"The schools we've studied \u2014 and we characterize their school climate \u2014 that are strict in structure and discipline but also emphasize having supportive connections with young people \u2014 have far less violent crime, less bullying, higher test scores,\" he says. \"They are simply superior places for your kids to go to school.\"\n'Common Sense' Implementation\nZero-tolerance policies, which vary widely from state to state and school to school, can seem extreme. A New Jersey teenager, for example, was suspended for five days last year for having an over-the-counter allergy medication in school. And a kindergartner was barred from school for 10 days in 2000 for bringing a nail file to class. Both cases made national headlines.\nBut Kenneth Trump, a school security consultant with more than 25 years of experience in K-12 settings, says most schools implement their zero-tolerance policies with \"good common sense.\"\n\"The media has skewed this issue and it's become politicized,\" he says. \"For every case where a student is expelled from school for a questionable infraction, we can point to half a dozen cases where the schools didn't enforce the policy for serious offenses.\"\nTrump attributes most of the \"bad calls\" by schools to new administrators who simply need more training.\nBetsy Landers, president of the National PTA, is circumspect about zero-tolerance policies, saying the decisions need to be made on a local level.\n\"Each community approaches it very differently because of different situations,\" Landers says. \"I think what's important is that parents are front and center in making those decisions.\"\nSome Schools Still Struggling\nDespite the overall decline in school violence, Brock says it's important to acknowledge that there are still plenty of schools where it's a problem.\nSome schools in cities like Detroit, San Francisco and Cleveland are struggling to make a safer environment for their students.\n\"In these cases, the violence in the school is a reflection of the fact that the schools are embedded in communities with higher crime rates,\" Brock says. \"We should acknowledge that they have a problem.\u201d\n\n", "search_tags": ["excessive worry about weight gain", "sudden changes in sleep habits", "visible prolonged sadness"]}, "doc5.txt": {"violence_tags": ["gang activities", "stealing", "weapons use", "making threats"], "document_text": "\r\rworks to prevent violence and its consequences, which includes sharing the importance of prevention to all of our audiences where they engage in discussions.

But what do we know about why young people become involved in violence? Why do\r\rsome youths get caught up in violence while others do not? There is no simple answer to these\r\rquestions, but scientists have identified a number of things that put children and adolescents at\r\rrisk of violent behavior and some things that seem to protect them from the effects of risk.\r\r\rIntroduction to Risk and Protective Factors\r\r\rThe concepts of risk and protection are integral to public health. A risk factor is anything that\r\rincreases the probability that a person will suffer harm. A protective factor is something that\r\rdecreases the potential harmful effect of a risk factor. In the context of this report, risk factors\r\rincrease the probability that a young person will become violent, while protective factors buffer\r\rthe young person against those risks. The public health approach to youth violence involves\r\ridentifying risk and protective factors, determining how they work, making the public aware of\r\rthese findings, and designing programs to prevent or stop the violence.\r\r\rRisk factors for violence are not static. Their predictive value changes depending on when they\r\roccur in a young person's development, in what social context, and under what circumstances.\r\rRisk factors may be found in the individual, the environment, or the individual's ability to\r\rrespond to the demands or requirements of the environment. Some factors come into play during\r\rchildhood or even earlier, whereas others do not appear until adolescence. Some involve the\r\rfamily, others the neighborhood, the school, or the peer group. Some become less important as a\r\rperson matures, while others persist throughout the life span. To complicate the picture even\r\rfurther, some factors may constitute risks during one stage of development but not another.\r\rFinally, the factors that predict the onset of violence are not necessarily the same as those that\r\rpredict the continuation or cessation of violence.\r\r\rViolence prevention and intervention efforts hinge on identifying risk and protective factors and\r\rdetermining when in the course of development they emerge. To be effective, such efforts must\r\rbe appropriate to a youth's stage of development. A program that is effective in childhood may\r\rbe ineffective in adolescence and vice versa. Moreover, the risk and protective factors targeted\r\rby violence prevention programs may be different from those targeted by intervention programs,\r\rwhich are designed to prevent the reoccurrence of violence.\r\r\rThis report groups risk and protective factors into five domains: individual, family, peer group,\r\rschool, and community, which includes both the neighborhood and the larger society (Box 4-1).\r\rFactors do not always fit neatly into these areas, however. Broken homes are classified as a\r\rfamily risk factor, but the presence of many such families in a community can contribute to\r\rsocial disorganization, an important community-level risk factor (Bursik & Grasmick, 1993;\r\rElliott et al., 1996; Sampson & Lauritsen, 1994).\r\n          Table\r\r\r          Box 4-1. Early and late risk factors for violence at age 15 to 18 and proposed\r\r          protective factors, by domain.\r\r\r\rRisk Factors\r\r\rRisk factors are not necessarily causes. Researchers identify risk factors for youth violence by\r\rtracking the development of children and adolescents over the first two decades of life and\r\rmeasuring how frequently particular personal characteristics and social conditions at a given age\r\rare linked to violence at later stages of the life course. Evidence for these characteristics and\r\rsocial conditions must go beyond simple empirical relationships, however. To be considered risk\r\rfactors, they must have both a theoretical rationale and a demonstrated ability to predict violence\r\r-- essential conditions for a causal relationship (Earls, 1994; Kraemer et al., 1997; Thornberry,\r\r1998). The reason risk factors are not considered causes is that, in most cases, scientists lack\r\rexperimental evidence that changing a risk factor produces changes in the onset or rate of\r\rviolence.\r\r\rAs used in this report, risk factors are personal characteristics or environmental conditions that\r\rpredict the onset, continuity, or escalation of violence.\r\r\rThe question of causality has practical implications for prevention efforts. Prevention depends\r\rlargely on risk factors being true causes of violence. In practical terms, research has amassed\r\renough strong, consistent evidence for the risk factors discussed in this report to provide a basis\r\rfor prevention programs, even though a strict cause-and-effect relationship has been established\r\rfor relatively few of them.\r\r\rMost of the risk factors identified do not appear to have a strong biological basis. Instead, it is\r\rtheorized, they result from social learning or the combination of social learning and biological\r\rprocesses. This means that violent youths who have violent parents are far more likely to have\r\rmodeled their behavior on their parents' behavior -- to have learned violent behavior from them -\r\r- than simply to have inherited it from them. Likewise, society's differing expectations of boys\r\rand girls -- expecting boys to be more aggressive, for example -- can result in learned behaviors\r\rthat increase or decrease the risk of violence.\r\r\rThe bulk of the research that has been done on risk factors identifies and measures their\r\rpredictive value separately, without taking into account the influence of other risk factors. More\r\rimportant than any individual factor, however, is the accumulation of risk factors. Risk factors\r\rusually exist in clusters, not in isolation. Children who are abused or neglected, for example,\r\rtend to be in poor families with single parents living in disadvantaged neighborhoods beset with\r\rviolence, drug use, and crime. Studies of multiple risk factors have found that they have\r\rindependent, additive effects -- that is, the more risk factors a child is exposed to, the greater the\r\rlikelihood that he or she will become violent. One study, for example, has found that a 10-year-\r\rold exposed to 6 or more risk factors is 10 times as likely to be violent by age 18 as a 10-year-old\r\rexposed to only one factor (Herrenkohl et al., 2000).\r\r\rResearchers have theorized that risk factors also interact with each other, but to date they have\r\rfound little evidence of interaction. What evidence does exist suggests that interactions between\r\ror among factors produce only small effects, but work in this area is continuing. To date, much\r\rmore research has been done on risk factors than protective factors, but that picture, too, is\r\nchanging.\r\r\rDevelopmental Progression to Violence\r\r\rScientific theory and research take two different approaches to how youth violence develops --\r\rone that focuses on the onset of violent behavior and its frequency, patterns, and continuity over\r\rthe life course and one that focuses on the emergence of risk factors at different stages of the life\r\rcourse. Chapter 3 describes two developmental trajectories for the onset of violent behavior --\r\rone in which violence begins in childhood (before puberty) and continues into adolescence, and\r\rone in which violence begins in adolescence.\r\r\rIn contrast, this chapter considers the timing of risk factors. It identifies the individual\r\rcharacteristics, experiences, and environmental conditions in childhood or adolescence that\r\rpredict involvement in violent behavior in late adolescence -- that is, age 15 to 18, the peak years\r\rof offending. Research shows that different risk factors may emerge in these two developmental\r\rperiods and that the same risk factors may have different effect sizes, or predictive power, in\r\rthese periods.\r\r\rThe timing of risk factors and the onset of violence are connected. Only risk factors that emerge\r\rin early childhood can logically account for violence that begins before puberty. However, these\r\rearly risk factors may or may not be implicated in violence that begins in adolescence. In fact,\r\rstudies show that many youths with late-onset violence did not encounter the childhood risk\r\rfactors responsible for early-onset violence. For these youths, risk factors for violence emerged\r\rin adolescence (Huizinga et al., 1995; Moffitt et al., 1996; Patterson & Yoerger, 1997; Simons et\r\ral., 1994).\r\r\rTable 4-1 lists early and late risk factors and estimates their effect sizes for violence at age 15 to\r\r18. It does not distinguish between youths who became violent before puberty and those who\r\rfirst became violent in adolescence; both groups are included among youths who were violent in\r\rlate adolescence. However, the table does indicate that different risk factors emerge before\r\rpuberty (age 6 to 11) and after puberty (age 12 to 14) and that the same risk factors have different\r\reffect sizes in these periods. Thus, for example, the table shows that substance use in childhood\r\rhas a greater effect on violence at age 15 to 18 than parental abuse or neglect does and that\r\rsubstance use in childhood has a greater effect on violence than substance use in early\r\radolescence. (The table is discussed at greater length below, in A Note on Sources.)\r\r\r          Table\r\r\r          Table 4-1. Effect sizes of early and late risk factors for\r\r          violence* at age 15 to 18.\r\r\r\rThe distinction between early and late risk factors is important. To be effective, prevention\r\rprograms must address the risk factors that appear at a particular stage of development. The\r\robserved clustering of risk factors in childhood and in adolescence provides clear targets for\r\rintervention during these stages of the life course.\r\r\rLimitations of Risk Factors\r\r\rRisk factors are powerful tools for identifying and locating populations and individuals with a\r\nhigh potential for becoming violent, and they provide valuable targets for programs aimed at\r\rpreventing or reducing violence. But there are important limitations to our knowledge about and\r\ruse of risk factors.\r\r\rThe following cautions are worth bearing in mind:\r\r\rNo single risk factor or set of risk factors is powerful enough to predict with certainty\r\rthat youths will become violent. Poor performance in school is a risk factor, for\r\rexample, but by no means will all young people who perform poorly in school become\r\rviolent. Similarly, many youths are exposed to multiple risks yet avoid becoming\r\rinvolved in violence (Garmezy, 1985; Rutter, 1985; Werner & Smith, 1982, 1992).\r\r\rBecause public health research is based on observations and statistical probabilities in\r\rlarge populations, risk factors can be used to predict violence in groups with particular\r\rcharacteristics or environmental conditions but not in individuals.\r\r\rGiven these two limitations, assessments designed to target individual youths for\r\rintervention programs must be used with great care. Most individual youths identified\r\rby existing risk factors for violence, even youths facing accumulated risks, never\r\rbecome violent (Farrington, 1997; Huizinga et al., 1995; Lipsey & Derzon, 1998).\r\r\rSome risk factors are not amenable to change and therefore are not good targets for\r\rintervention (Earls, 1994; Hawkins et al., 1998a). Being born male is an example.\r\r\rOf the risk factors that are amenable to change, some are not realistic targets of\r\rpreventive efforts. Eliminating poverty is not a realistic short-term goal, for example,\r\rbut programs that counter some of the effects of poverty are. (Eliminating or reducing\r\rpoverty should be a high-priority long-term goal, however.)\r\r\rSome situations and conditions that influence the likelihood of violence or the form it\r\rtakes may not be identified by longitudinal studies as risk factors (predictors) for\r\rviolence. Situational factors such as bullying, taunting, and demeaning interactions can\r\rserve as catalysts for unplanned violence. The social context can influence the\r\rseriousness or form of violence -- for example, the presence of a gun or a gathering\r\rcrowd of peers that makes a youth feel he (or she) needs to protect his (or her)\r\rreputation. These may not be primary causes of violence, yet they are contributing\r\rfactors and are important to understanding how a violent exchange unfolds. Such\r\rinfluences, although important, may not be identified in this report because of the way\r\rrisk factors are defined.\r\r\rMany studies of risk factors, particularly earlier ones, drew their samples from white\r\rboys and young men. The limited focus of these studies calls into question their\r\rpredictive power for girls and women and for other racial or ethnic groups. Differences\r\ramong cultures and their socialization and expectations of girls and boys may modify\r\rthe influences of some risk factors in these groups.\r\r\rNonetheless, most of the risk factors identified in this report do apply broadly to all young\r\rpeople. All children go through the same basic stages of human development -- and prevention\r\rof youth violence is based on understanding when and how risk factors come into play at various\r\rstages of development. Moreover, there is some evidence that most risk factors are equally valid\r\npredictors of delinquency and violence regardless of sex, race, or ethnicity (Rosay et al., 2000;\r\rWilliams et al., 1999). Sophisticated studies that identify how cultural differences affect the\r\rinterplay of the individual and his or her surroundings will make possible more effective\r\rprevention efforts.\r\r\rProtective Factors\r\r\rThere is some disagreement about exactly what protective factors are. They have been viewed\r\rboth as the absence of risk and as something conceptually distinct from risk (Guerra, 1998;\r\rJessor et al., 1995; Reiss & Roth, 1993; Wasserman & Miller, 1998). The former view typically\r\rplaces risk and protective factors on the opposite ends of a continuum. For example, good\r\rparent-child relations might be considered a protective factor because it is the opposite of poor\r\rparent-child relations, a known risk factor. But a simple linear relationship of this sort (where the\r\rrisk of violence decreases as parent-child relations improve) blurs the distinction between risk\r\rand protection, making them essentially the same thing.1\r\r\rThe view that protection is conceptually distinct from risk (the view used in this report) defines\r\rprotective factors as characteristics or conditions that interact with risk factors to reduce their\r\rinfluence on violent behavior (Garmezy, 1985; Rutter, 1985; Stattin & Magnusson, 1996). For\r\rexample, low family socioeconomic status is a risk factor for violence, and a warm, supportive\r\rrelationship with a parent may be a protective factor. The warm relationship does not improve\r\rthe child's economic status, but it does buffer the child from some of the adverse effects of\r\rpoverty. Protective factors may or may not have a direct effect on violence (compare Jessor et al.,\r\r1995 and Stattin & Magnusson, 1996).\r\r\rInterest in protective factors emerged from research in the field of developmental\r\rpsychopathology. Investigators observed that children with exposure to multiple risk factors\r\roften escaped their impact. This led to a search for the characteristics or conditions that might\r\rconfer resilience -- that is, factors that moderate or buffer the effects of risk (Davis, 1999;\r\rGarmezy, 1985; Rutter, 1987; Werner, 1989). Protective factors offer an explanation for why\r\rchildren and adolescents who face the same degree of risk may be affected differently.\r\r\rThe concept of protective factors is familiar in public health. Wearing seat belts, for example,\r\rreduces the risk of serious injury or death in a car crash. Identifying and measuring the effects of\r\rprotective factors is a new area of violence research, and information about these factors is\r\rlimited. Because they buffer the effect of risk factors, protective factors are an important tool in\r\rviolence prevention.\r\r\rLike risk factors, proposed protective factors are grouped into individual, family, school, peer\r\rgroup, and community categories. They may differ at various stages of development, they may\r\rinteract, and they may exert cumulative effects (Catalano et al., 1998; Furstenberg et al., 1999;\r\rGarmezy, 1985; Jessor et al., 1995; Rutter, 1979; Sameroff et al., 1993; Thornberry et al., 1995).\r\rJust as risk factors do not necessarily cause an individual child or young person to become\r\rviolent, protective factors do not guarantee that an individual child or young person will not\r\rbecome violent. They reduce the probability that groups of young people facing a risk factor or\r\rfactors will become involved in violence.\r\r\rA Note on Sources\r\nThis chapter draws heavily on four important studies: Lipsey & Derzon's meta-analysis of 34\r\rlongitudinal studies on risk factors for violence (1998); Hawkins et al.'s study of malleable risk\r\rand protective factors drawn from 30 longitudinal studies, including some not included in the\r\rLipsey & Derzon meta-analysis (Hawkins et al., 1998c); Paik and Comstock's meta-analysis of\r\r217 studies of exposure to media violence and its effects on aggression and violence (1994); and\r\rthe National Institute of Mental Health's Taking Stock report (Hann & Borek, in press), an\r\rextensive review of research on risk factors for aggression and other behavior problems.\r\r\rTable 4-1 is adapted from the tables presented in the Lipsey and Derzon and Hawkins et al. meta-\r\ranalyses. The risk factors in Table 4-1 predict felonies -- that is, violent and property crimes -- at\r\rages 15 to 18, the peak years of involvement. Entries in bold are effect sizes from the meta-2\r\ranalyses by Lipsey and Derzon, Hawkins et al., and Paik and Comstock for various classes of\r\rrisk factors; other entries are effect sizes reported in two or more longitudinal studies. (Risk\r\rclasses are described in Appendix 4-A and later sections of this chapter.) Some of the risk classes\r\rin Table 4-1 include several separate risk factors. For example, psychological condition includes\r\rhyperactivity, daring, and attention problems.\r\r\rAdditional risk factors and classes of risk factors have been added from other sources. For\r\rexample, there is adequate evidence to establish harsh, lax, or inconsistent discipline as a\r\rseparate risk factor, although Lipsey and Derzon include it in the poor parent-child relations\r\rclass. Academic failure, family conflict, and belonging to a gang are additional examples of risk\r\rfactors not included in any of the meta-analyses.\r\r\rThe measure of effect size used in these tables is a bivariate correlation (r), or simple correlation\r\rbetween two variables. All estimates of effect size are statistically significant and are based on\r\rmultiple studies, with those for risk classes typically involving more studies than those for\r\rseparate risk factors. The studies reviewed in Lipsey and Derzon, Paik and Comstock, and\r\rHawkins et al. are not cited here; however, other studies that were used to establish a risk factor\r\ror that are included in estimates of effect size are cited.3\r\r\rThere is a rich and extensive body of research on risks for antisocial behavior, externalizing\r\rbehavior, conduct disorder, and aggression (Hann & Borek, in press). Each of these terms defines\r\ra pattern or set of behaviors that includes aggressive or violent behavior, but most of the\r\rbehaviors included are either nonphysical, nonviolent acts or relatively minor forms of physical\r\raggression. Risk factors for antisocial behavior may be quite different from those that predict\r\rviolent behavior (robbery, aggravated assault, rape, and homicide). Since antisocial behavior\r\rdoes not present the potential for serious injury or death that violence does, this report relies on\r\rstudies that identify risk factors for serious offenses generally and violent behavior specifically,\r\rbearing in mind that the vast majority of serious offenders report having been involved in violent\r\roffenses.\r\r\rSummary\r\r\rRisk and protective factors can be found in every area of a child or adolescent's life, they exert\r\rdifferent effects at different stages of development, and they gain strength in numbers. The\r\rpublic health approach to the problem of youth violence seeks to identify risk and protective\r\rfactors, determine when in the life course they typically occur and how they operate, and enable\r\rresearchers to design preventive programs to be put in place at just the right time to be most\r\neffective.\r\r\rThis chapter describes what is known about individual, family, school, peer group, and\r\rcommunity risk and protective factors that exert their effects in childhood and adolescence. It\r\rdescribes the power of early risk factors, which come into play before puberty, and late risk\r\rfactors, which exert their influence after puberty, to predict the likelihood of youth violence.\r\r\rRisk Factors in Childhood\r\r\rThe first decade of life encompasses a vast period of human development. Infants form\r\rattachments to parents or other loving adults and begin to become aware of themselves as\r\rseparate beings. As toddlers, they begin to talk, to assert themselves, to explore the world around\r\rthem, and to extend their emotional and social bonds to people other than their parents.\r\r\rThe start of school is a milestone in children's continuing social and intellectual development.\r\rOther children become more important in their lives, though still not as important as family\r\rmembers. They begin to empathize with others and hone their sense of right and wrong. As they\r\rprogress through elementary school, children gain valuable reasoning and problem-solving skills\r\ras well as social skills.\r\r\rExposure to or involvement in violence can disrupt normal development of both children and\r\radolescents, with profound effects on their mental, physical, and emotional health. In addition,4\r\rexposure to violence affects children and adolescents differently at different stages of\r\rdevelopment (Marans & Adelman, 1997).\r\r\rYoung children exposed to violence may have nightmares or be afraid to go to sleep, fear being\r\rleft alone, or regress to earlier behavior, such as baby talk or bed-wetting. They may exhibit\r\rexcessive irritability or excitability. Violence in the family, especially, may inhibit young\r\rchildren's ability to form trusting relationships and develop independence.\r\r\rElementary school children who live in violent neighborhoods may also experience sleep\r\rdisturbances and be less likely to explore their environment. In addition, they can become\r\rfrightened, anxious, depressed, and aggressive. They may have trouble concentrating in school.\r\rBecause they understand that violence is intentional, they may worry about what they could have\r\rdone to prevent or stop it (Osofsky, 1999).\r\r\rViolence also affects parents. Adults living in violent households or neighborhoods may not be\r\rable to keep their children safe or to protect them from harmful influences. Some parents living\r\rin unsafe neighborhoods do not let their children play outside. While this solution may safeguard\r\rchildren temporarily, it can also impede healthy development. Parents in these situations\r\runderstandably feel helpless and hopeless. Those who have been traumatized by violence\r\rthemselves may, like their children, become anxious, withdrawn, or depressed. Under such\r\rcircumstances, parents cannot respond spontaneously and joyously to their children, making it\r\rdifficult for children to develop strong, secure attachments to their parents. Forming a bond with\r\ra loving, responsive parent or other adult caregiver is an essential factor in healthy development\r\r(Furstenberg et al., 1999; Osofsky, 1999; Patterson & Yoerger, 1997). Children and families\r\rexposed to or involved in violence may want to seek professional advice in addressing their\r\rmental, physical, and emotional health concerns.\r\r\rRisk Factors by Domain\r\nA few risk factors for youth violence occur before birth. Others come into play as the child\r\rdevelops in response to his or her family and surroundings. Thus, most of the risk factors that\r\rexert an effect before puberty are found in the individual and family domains rather than in the\r\rlarger world, a situation that changes dramatically in adolescence. Childhood risk factors are\r\rlisted by domain in Box 4-1; effect sizes are listed in Table 4-1.\r\r\rIndividual\r\r\rThe most powerful early risk factors for violence at age 15 to 18 are involvement in general\r\roffenses and substance use before age 12. General offenses include serious, but not necessarily\r\rviolent acts, such as burglary, grand theft, extortion, and conviction for a felony. Children\r\rengaging in such crimes often come to the attention of the police and juvenile justice system.\r\rNumerous studies have documented the overlap between serious nonviolent and violent offenses\r\rin adolescence, so early involvement in serious offenses carries a substantial risk for violence\r\rlater.\r\r\rExperimentation with drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or some combination of these substances is not\r\rparticularly unusual by age 18, but use of these substances by children under the age of 12 is.\r\rNot only are these substances harmful to health, they are illegal. Thus, use of these substances\r\rsignals antisocial attitudes and early involvement in a delinquent lifestyle that often comes to\r\rinclude violent behavior in adolescence (Fagan, 1993).\r\r\rTwo moderate risk factors emerge in childhood, being male and aggression. Boys (and young\r\rmen) are far more likely than girls to be violent (see Chapter 2), yet some researchers have\r\rsuggested that sex is a risk marker rather than a risk factor (Earls, 1994; Hawkins et al., 1998a;\r\rKraemer et al., 1997). A risk marker is a characteristic or condition that is associated with known\r\rrisk factors but exerts no causal influence of its own (Earls, 1994; Patterson & Yoerger, 1997).5\r\rFor example, many more boys than girls are hyperactive, a risk factor with a small effect size, so\r\rsome of the predictive power of being male may actually be the influence of hyperactivity.\r\rMoreover, boys have traditionally been exposed to more violence than girls, and socially\r\rapproved male role models are more aggressive, suggesting that social learning plays a role in\r\rthis risk factor. However, research indicates that being male confers risk even after accounting\r\rfor other known risk factors. This suggests that being male is a risk factor rather than a risk\r\rmarker, perhaps with some biological or biological-environmental interaction as the causal\r\rmechanism.\r\r\rMany studies have found aggression -- characterized as aggressive and disruptive behavior,\r\rverbal aggression, and aggression toward objects -- to be a moderate risk factor among boys,\r\ralthough there is some evidence that physical aggressiveness is actually responsible for most of\r\rthe observed effect (Nagin & Tremblay, 1999). Additional research is needed to sort out the\r\runique influence of each of these types of aggression.\r\r\rThe remaining individual risk factors have relatively small effect sizes. Various psychological\r\rconditions, such as hyperactivity, impulsiveness, daring, and short attention span, pose a small\r\rrisk for violence. A consistent individual predictor is hyperactivity/low attention, the central\r\rcomponents of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a cognitive disorder that may be\r\rgenetically influenced in some way (Hawkins et al., 1998a). ADHD is characterized by\r\rrestlessness, excessive activity, and difficulty paying attention, traits that may also contribute to\r\nlow academic performance, a risk factor in school. Hyperactivity is often found in combination\r\rwith physical aggression, another risk factor. Some researchers question the independent effect\r\rof hyperactivity on later violence, suggesting that the effect is actually physical aggression (and\r\rperhaps low academic performance) that was not controlled for in earlier studies of hyperactivity\r\r(Nagin & Tremblay, 1999). There is little agreement about the mechanism linking hyperactivity\r\rto violence.\r\r\rThe effects of children's exposure to television and film violence have been studied extensively\r\rin regard to aggression, but there is relatively little research regarding the effects on more serious\r\rforms of violent behavior (for an extended discussion, see Appendix 4-B). Experimental studies\r\rhave found that exposure to media violence has a small average effect size (.13) on serious forms\r\rof violence (Paik & Comstock, 1994); the average effect size in cross-sectional survey studies\r\rwas very small (.06). Two frequently cited longitudinal studies have examined the effects that\r\rexposure to television violence in childhood produces on violent behavior during adolescence or\r\rearly adulthood. One, in which participants reported having punched, beaten, or choked someone\r\ras young adults, found a significant predictive effect for women (.22) but no significant effect for\r\rmen (Huesmann et al., (submitted)). The other study, in which teenage males reported being\r\rinvolved in a knife fight, car theft, mugging, gang fight, or similar delinquent behavior, found a\r\rstatistically significant predictive effect in only one of nine tests (Milavsky et al., 1982).\r\rExposure to violence appears to have a weak predictive effect on relatively immediate violence\r\rin experimental studies, but there is little consistent evidence to date for a long-term predictive\r\reffect.\r\r\rLittle research has been done on violence in other media -- video games, music videos, and the\r\rInternet. A recent meta-analysis by Anderson and Bushman (in press) reports that video game\r\rviolence has a small average effect size (.19) on physical aggression in experimental and cross-\r\rsectional studies. Theoretically, the influence of these interactive media might well be greater\r\rthan that of television and films, which present a passive form of exposure, but there are no\r\rstudies to date of the effects of exposure to these types of media violence and violent behavior.\r\r\rProblem behavior, another risk factor with a small effect size, refers to relatively minor problem\r\rbehaviors such as stealing, truancy, disobedience, and temper tantrums. While not serious in\r\rthemselves, antisocial behaviors may set the stage for more serious nonviolent or violent\r\rbehavior later.\r\r\rThe medical or physical risk factor includes a number of conditions that as a group are somewhat\r\rpredictive of violence. Prenatal and early postnatal complications, a more specific set of medical\r\rconditions, have been found to have inconsistent effects across a number of studies (Hawkins et\r\ral., 1998c). These complications encompass a broad group of genetic conditions or physical\r\rinjuries to the brain and nervous system that interfere with normal development, including low\r\rbirth weight, oxygen deprivation, and exposure to toxins such as lead, alcohol, or drugs\r\r(Hawkins et al., 1998b). Low resting heart rate, a condition that has been studied primarily in\r\rboys, is associated with fearlessness or stimulation seeking, both characteristics that may\r\rpredispose them to aggression and violence (Raine et al., 1997; Hawkins et al., 1998c), but there\r\ris not enough evidence to establish this condition as a risk factor for violence. Some studies have\r\reven questioned its effects on aggression (Van Hulle et al., 2000; Wadsworth, 1976; Kindlon et\r\ral., 1995). There is also no evidence that internalizing disorders -- nervousness and withdrawal,\r\ranxiety, and worrying -- are related to later violence (Hawkins et al., 1998c).\r\nLow IQ, or low intelligence, includes learning problems and poor language ability. This risk\r\rfactor has a small effect size and is often accompanied by other risk factors with small effect\r\rsizes, such as hyperactivity/low attention and poor performance in school.\r\r\rAntisocial beliefs and attitudes, including dishonesty, rule-breaking, hostility to police, and a\r\rgenerally favorable attitude toward violence, usually constitute a risk factor in adolescence, not\r\rchildhood (Hawkins et al., 1998c). Only dishonesty in childhood is predictive of later violence or\r\rdelinquency, and its effect is small.\r\r\rFamily\r\r\rThere are no known strong risk factors for youth violence in the family domain, but low\r\rsocioeconomic status/poverty and having antisocial parents are moderate factors. Socioeconomic\r\rstatus generally refers to parents' education and occupation as well as their income. Poorly\r\reducated parents may be unable to help their children with schoolwork, for example, and\r\rchildren living in poor neighborhoods generally have less access to recreational and cultural\r\ropportunities. In addition, many poor families live in violent neighborhoods, and exposure to\r\rviolence can adversely affect both parents and children, as described above. Limited social and\r\reconomic resources contribute to parental stress, child abuse and neglect, damaged parent-child\r\rrelations, and family breakup -- all risk factors with small effects in childhood.\r\r\rStudies suggest that antisocial parents -- that is, violent, criminal parents -- represent an\r\renvironmental rather than a genetic risk factor (Moffitt, 1987). In other words, children learn\r\rviolent behavior by observing their parents rather than by inheriting a propensity for violence. In\r\rfact, attachment to parents, a possible protective factor, can have the opposite effect if the parents\r\rare violent (Hawkins et al., 1998c).\r\r\rAmong the early risk factors with small effect sizes on youth violence is poor parent-child\r\rrelations. One specific risk factor in this class -- harsh, lax, or inconsistent discipline -- is also\r\rsomewhat predictive of later violence (Hawkins et al., 1998c). Children need reasonable,\r\rconsistent discipline to establish the boundaries of acceptable and unacceptable behavior.\r\rChildren who are treated harshly may view rough treatment as acceptable, those who are given\r\rno guidance may engage in whatever behavior gets them what they want, and children who\r\rreceive mixed signals are completely at sea regarding appropriate behavior. Other family\r\rconditions, such as high stress, large size, and marital discord, also exert a small effect on later\r\rviolence.\r\r\rAnother childhood predictor with a small effect size is broken homes, a category that includes\r\rdivorced, separated, or never-married parents and a child's separation from parents before age 16.\r\rSeparation from parents also operates as a distinct risk factor, again with a small effect size.\r\r\rAbusive parenting in general and neglect in particular are predictors of later violence, but they\r\rhave very small effect sizes. Neglect operates as a distinct risk factor, possibly because neglected\r\rchildren are less likely to be supervised or taught appropriate behavior. This is not to imply that\r\rchild abuse and neglect do not cause serious problems in adolescence: Indeed, they have large\r\reffects on mental health problems, substance abuse, and poor school performance (Belsky &\r\rVondra, 1987; Cicchetti & Toth, 1995; Dembo et al., 1992; Esbensen & Huizinga, 1991;\r\rSilverman, et al., 1996; Smith & Thornberry, 1995). This finding is discussed in more detail\r\rbelow, in the section on unexpected findings and effects.\r\nSchool\r\r\rThe only early risk factor in the school domain is poor attitude toward and performance in\r\rschool, and its effects are small. Numerous individual and family factors may contribute to poor\r\rperformance, making it a fairly broad measure. For example, a child who is physically aggressive\r\rand is rejected by peers or who has difficulty concentrating or sitting still in class may\r\runderstandably have difficulty performing academic tasks. Children who have been exposed to\r\rviolence, as noted earlier, may also have trouble concentrating in school.\r\r\rPeer Group\r\r\rYoung children do not socialize extensively with other children and are not strongly influenced\r\rby peers. Peers become more important as children progress through elementary school, although\r\rschool-age children still look primarily to parents for cues on how to behave. Nonetheless, weak\r\rsocial ties to conventional peers and associating with antisocial peers both exert small effects in\r\rchildhood.\r\r\rChildren with weak social ties are those who attend few social activities and have low popularity\r\rwith conventional peers. School-age children often reject physically aggressive children because\r\rof their inappropriate behavior (Hann & Borek, in press; Reiss & Roth, 1993). The combination\r\rof rejection and aggressiveness exacerbates behavior problems, making it more difficult for\r\raggressive children to form positive relationships with other children. Indeed, recent research\r\rindicates that children who are both aggressive and rejected show poorer adjustment in\r\relementary school than children who are aggressive, rejected, or neither (Hann & Borek, in\r\rpress).\r\r\rBeing drawn to antisocial peers may introduce or reinforce antisocial attitudes and behavior in\r\rchildren. Indeed, aggressive children tend to seek each other out (Hann & Borek, in press).\r\r\rCommunity\r\r\rCommunity risk factors, such as living in socially disorganized neighborhoods or neighborhoods\r\rwith high rates of crime, violence, and drugs, are not powerful individual-level predictors in\r\rchildhood because these external influences have less direct impact on children than on\r\radolescents. They may well exert indirect influences through poor parenting practices, lack of\r\rfamily resources, and parent criminality or antisocial behavior.\r\r\rSummary\r\r\rThe most powerful early predictors of violence at age 15 to 18 are involvement in general\r\roffenses (serious, but not necessarily violent, criminal acts) and substance use. Moderate factors\r\rare being male, aggressiveness, low family socioeconomic status/poverty, and antisocial parents.\r\r\rRisk Factors in Adolescence\r\r\rViolence increases dramatically in the second decade of life, peaking during late adolescence at\r\r12 to 20 percent of all young people and dropping off again sharply by the early twenties. Some\r\rof these youths followed the childhood-onset trajectory, becoming violent before puberty and\r\rescalating their rate of offending during adolescence. But over half of all violent youths begin\r\rtheir violent behavior in mid- to late adolescence. These youths gave little indication of problem\r\nbehavior in childhood and did not have poor relations with their parents.\r\r\rThere are numerous theories about why violence begins in adolescence, but a few themes run\r\rthrough most of them (Elliott & Tolan, 1999; Pepler & Slaby, 1994). Developmentally, puberty is\r\raccompanied by major physical and emotional changes that alter a young person's relationships\r\rand patterns of interaction with others. The transition into adolescence begins the move toward\r\rindependence from parents and the need to establish one's own values, personal and sexual\r\ridentity, and the skills and competencies needed to compete in adult society. Independence\r\rrequires young people to renegotiate family rules and degree of supervision by parents, a process\r\rthat can generate conflict and withdrawal from parents. At the same time, social networks\r\rexpand, and relationships with peers and adults in new social contexts equal or exceed in\r\rimportance the relationships with parents. The criteria for success and acceptance among peers\r\rand adults change.\r\r\rAdapting to all of these changes in relationships, social contexts, status, and performance criteria\r\rcan generate great stress, feelings of rejection, and anger at perceived or real failure. Young\r\rpeople may be attracted to violent behavior as a way of asserting their independence of the adult\r\rworld and its rules, as a way of gaining the attention and respect of peers, as a way of\r\rcompensating for limited personal competencies, or as a response to restricted opportunities for\r\rsuccess at school or in the community. Good relationships with parents during childhood will\r\rhelp in a successful transition to adolescence, but they do not guarantee it.\r\r\rAdolescents exposed to violence at home may experience some of the same emotions and\r\rdifficulties as younger school-age children -- for example, fear, guilt, anxiety, depression, and\r\rtrouble concentrating in school. In addition, adolescents may feel more vulnerable to violence\r\rfrom peers at school or gangs in their neighborhood and hopeless about their lives and their odds\r\rof surviving to adulthood. These young people may not experience the growing feelings of\r\rcompetence that are important at their stage of development. Ultimately, their exposure to\r\rviolence may lead them to become violent themselves. Studies have shown that adolescents\r\rexposed to violence are more likely to engage in violent acts, often as preemptive strikes in the\r\rface of a perceived threat (Fagan & Wilkinson, 1998; Loeber et al., 1998; Singer et al., 1994,\r\r1995).\r\r\rRisk Factors by Domain\r\r\rNot surprisingly, different risk factors for violence assume importance in adolescence. Family\r\rfactors lose predictive value relative to peer-oriented risk factors such as weak social ties to\r\rconventional peers, antisocial or delinquent friends, and membership in a gang (Table 4-1). Even\r\rinvolvement in general offenses, which had the largest effect size in childhood, has only a\r\rmoderate effect size in adolescence.\r\r\rIndividual\r\r\rIn early adolescence, involvement in general offenses -- that is, illegal but not necessarily violent\r\racts, including felonies -- becomes a moderate risk factor for violence between the ages of 15\r\rand 18. Its predictive power lessens from childhood, largely because teenagers are somewhat\r\rmore likely than children to engage in illegal behavior.\r\r\rPsychological conditions, notably restlessness, difficulty concentrating, and risk taking, have\r\nsmall effect sizes in adolescence. Restlessness and difficulty concentrating can affect\r\rperformance in school, a risk factor whose importance increases slightly in adolescence. Risk\r\rtaking gains predictive power in early adolescence, particularly in combination with other\r\rfactors. A reckless youth who sees violence as an acceptable means of expression, for example,\r\ris more likely to engage in violent behavior.\r\r\rAggressiveness exerts a small effect on later violence among adolescent males, as does simply\r\rbeing male. While aggressiveness is unusual in children between the ages of about 6 and 10, it is\r\rnot terribly unusual in adolescence. Similarly, physical violence and crimes against persons in\r\rearly adolescence have a small effect on the likelihood of violence at ages 15 to 18.\r\r\rAntisocial attitudes and beliefs, including hostility toward police and a positive attitude toward\r\rviolence, are more important predictors among adolescent boys than they are among children,\r\rbut their effect sizes remain small. Antisocial behavior and low IQ continue to have small effect\r\rsizes in adolescence.\r\r\rSubstance use, which was a strong predictor of later violence for children, poses a small risk of\r\rlater violence for adolescents. The question as to whether drug use causes young people to\r\rbecome violent is complex and has been widely studied (see Miczek et al., 1994 for a review),\r\rbut there is little compelling pharmacological evidence linking illicit drug use and violence. In\r\rone large study, youths reported that over 80 percent of the violent incidents they initiated had\r\rnot been preceded by drug use, including alcohol use (Huizinga et al., 1995). Thus, the risk may\r\rlie more in the characteristics of the social settings in which drug use and violence are likely to\r\roccur than in any effect of drugs on behavior (Parker & Auerhahn, 1998; Reiss & Roth, 1993).\r\r\rThe majority of violent adolescent offenders use alcohol and illicit drugs (see Chapter 3). Illicit\r\rdrug use tends to begin after the onset of violence and to be associated with more frequent\r\rviolent behavior and a longer criminal career (Elliott et al., 1989). This finding suggests that drug\r\ruse may contribute to continued violence rather than to the onset of violence, but it is far from\r\rconclusive. Evidence shows that some violent behavior stems from robberies or other attempts to\r\rget money to support a drug habit but also that this link is relatively rare. If any substance can be\r\rsaid to cause youth violence, that substance is alcohol (APA, 1993; Parker & Auerhahn, 1998);\r\rhowever, this causal link is inconclusive because adolescent drinking is dependent to a large\r\rdegree on the situation and social context in which it takes place (for reviews, see Parker &\r\rAuerhahn, 1998; Pernanen, 1991; Reiss & Roth, 1993; Roizen, 1993).\r\r\rFamily\r\r\rParents' direct influence on behavior is largely eclipsed by peer influence during adolescence.\r\rNot surprisingly, therefore, most family risk factors diminish in importance, including the\r\rinfluence of antisocial parents and low socioeconomic status, the most powerful early risk\r\rfactors. There are no large or even moderate risk factors in the family domain in adolescence.\r\r\rPoor parent-child relations continue to have a small effect size, but for adolescents this category\r\rincludes inadequate supervision and monitoring of young people's activities and low parental\r\rinvolvement, in addition to inappropriate discipline (Elliott et al., 1985; Hawkins et al., 1998a;\r\rPatterson & Yoerger, 1997; Roitberg & Menard, 1995). Broken homes and parental abuse also\r\rexert small effects. Other adverse family conditions present a risk factor; for example, some\r\rstudies have found that family conflict is a risk factor for violence among adolescent males.\r\nAlthough parents can and do influence their adolescents' behavior, they do so largely indirectly.\r\rThe kind of peers chosen by young people, for example, is related to the relationship they have\r\rwith their parents (Elliott et al., 1989; Hill et al., 1999; Patterson & Yoerger, 1997; Simons et al.,\r\r1994).\r\r\rSchool\r\r\rThere are no large or moderate risk factors for violence in the school domain, but poor attitude\r\rtoward or performance in school -- particularly if it leads to academic failure -- is a slightly\r\rlarger risk factor in early adolescence than in childhood.\r\r\rResearch on school violence indicates that a culture of violence has arisen in some schools,\r\radversely affecting not just students but teachers and administrators as well (Gottfredson et al., in\r\rpress; Lorion, 1998). Students exposed to violence at school may react by staying home to avoid\r\rthe threat or by taking weapons to school in order to defend themselves (Brener et al., 1999). For\r\rtheir part, teachers may burn out after years of dealing with discipline problems and threats of\r\rviolence.\r\r\rSchools located in socially disorganized neighborhoods are more likely to have a high rate of\r\rviolence than schools in other neighborhoods (Laub & Lauritsen, 1998). At the same time,\r\rhowever, researchers emphasize that most of the violence to which young people are exposed\r\rtakes place in their home neighborhood or the neighborhood surrounding the school, not in the\r\rschool itself (Laub & Lauritsen, 1998). Individual schools, like individual students, do not\r\rnecessarily reflect the characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood. A stable, well-\r\radministered school in a violent neighborhood may function as a safe haven for students.\r\r\rSome gang activity takes place in schools, but school gangs are generally younger and less\r\rviolent than street gangs, which form in neighborhoods (Laub & Lauritsen, 1998). Gangs in\r\rschools increased dramatically (by 87 percent) between 1989 and 1995 but have recently\r\rdeclined (see Chapter 3). The chances of becoming a victim of violence are more than two and\r\rone-half times as great in schools where gangs are reported, and these schools are\r\rdisproportionately located in disadvantaged, disorganized neighborhoods (Met Life, 1993;\r\rSnyder & Sickmund, 1999).\r\r\rPeer groups complicate the picture further. They operate both in neighborhoods and in schools,\r\rbut the concentration of young people in schools may intensify the influence of these groups.\r\rOne large study of adolescent males found that some schools have dominant peer groups that\r\rvalue academic achievement and disapprove of violence, while others have groups that approve\r\rof the use of violence (Felson et al., 1994). This study found that the risk of becoming involved\r\rin violence varied depending on the dominant peer culture in their school, regardless of their own\r\rviews about the use of violence.\r\r\rPeer Group\r\r\rPeer groups are all-important in adolescence. Adolescents who have weak social ties -- that is,\r\rwho are not involved in conventional social activities and are unpopular at school -- are at high\r\rrisk of becoming violent, as are adolescents with antisocial, delinquent peers. These two types of\r\rpeer relationships often go together, since adolescents who are rejected by or unpopular with\r\rconventional peers may find acceptance only in antisocial or delinquent peer groups. Social\r\nisolation -- having neither conventional nor antisocial friends -- is not a risk factor for violence,\r\rhowever (Cairns & Cairns, 1991; Elliott & Menard, 1996; Fergusson & Lynskey, 1996; Patterson\r\r& Yoerger, 1997). A third risk factor with a large effect size on violence is belonging to a gang.\r\rGang membership increases the risk of violence above and beyond the risk posed by having\r\rdelinquent peers (Thornberry, 1998). These three peer group factors appear to have independent\r\reffects, they sometimes cluster together, and they are all powerful late predictors of violence in\r\radolescence.\r\r\rResearchers who have studied what causes young people to join gangs have found that the risk\r\rfactors for gang membership are virtually the same as those for violence generally (Hill et al.,\r\r1999). The notion that gangs act as surrogate families for children who do not have close ties to\r\rtheir own families is not borne out by recent data (Hill et al., 1999), but gangs do strengthen\r\ryoung people's sense of belonging, their independence from parents, and their self-esteem.\r\rEstimates from law enforcement agencies indicate that gang members are overwhelmingly male\r\rand the great majority (almost 80 percent) are African American or Hispanic (Snyder &\r\rSickmund, 1999). But surveys in which young people identify themselves as gang members\r\rsuggest that there are substantially larger proportions of white and female gang members. In a\r\rsurvey of nearly 6,000 8th graders in 1995, 25 percent of white students and 38 percent of female\r\rstudents reported they were gang members (Esbensen & Osgood, 1997). Lacking comparisons\r\rwithin ethnic groups, it is difficult to tell whether ethnicity per se is a risk factor in gang\r\rmembership.\r\r\rCommunity\r\r\rIncreasing involvement in the community is a healthy part of adolescent development, unless the\r\rcommunity itself poses a threat to health and safety. Social disorganization and the presence of\r\rcrime and drugs in the neighborhood pose a small risk of violence when measured on an\r\rindividual level, as they are in Table 4-1. As noted in the table, however, both of these risk\r\rfactors have a substantially greater effect on the neighborhood level, where they measure the\r\raverage rate of violent offending by youths living in the neighborhood or community.\r\r\rSocially disorganized communities are characterized in part by economic and social flux, high\r\rturnover of residents, and a large proportion of disrupted or single-parent families, all of which\r\rlessen the likelihood that adults will be involved in informal networks of social control. As a\r\rresult, there is generally little adult knowledge or supervision of the activities of teenagers and a\r\rhigh rate of crime. Moreover, in areas experiencing economic decline, there are likely to be few\r\rneighborhood businesses. In such an environment, it is hard for young people to avoid being\r\rdrawn into violence. Not only are they on their own after school, they are exposed to violent\r\radults and youth gangs, they have few part-time job opportunities, and their neighborhood is not\r\rlikely to offer many after-school activities such as sports or youth groups (Bursik & Grasmick,\r\r1993; Sampson et al., 1997; Wilson, 1987).\r\r\rSocial disorganization is also a risk factor for violence in rural areas. One study of rural\r\rcommunities found that poverty plays a less important role in predicting violence than residential\r\rinstability, broken homes, and other indicators of social disorganization (Osgood & Chambers,\r\r2000). In fact, very poor areas were not characterized by high residential instability or a large\r\rproportion of broken homes. In cities, however, the combination of poverty with instability and\r\rfamily disruption is predictive of violence (Bursik & Grasmick, 1993; Elliott et al., 1996).\r\nAdolescents who are exposed to violence in their neighborhood feel vulnerable and unable to\r\rcontrol their lives. These feelings can lead to helplessness and hopelessness. Such young people\r\rmay turn to violence as a way of asserting control over their surroundings. They may arm\r\rthemselves or even join a gang for protection. Studies have shown that adolescents exposed to\r\rviolence are more likely to engage in violent acts, often as preemptive strikes in the face of a\r\rperceived threat (Singer et al., 1994, 1995).\r\r\rNeighborhood adults who are involved in crime pose a risk because young people may emulate\r\rthem. Easily available drugs add to the risk of violence. As noted earlier, drug use is associated\r\rwith both a higher rate of offending and a longer criminal career (Elliott et al., 1989). More\r\rimportant, ready availability of drugs indicates that considerable drug trafficking is taking place\r\rin the neighborhood -- and drug trafficking is dangerous for buyer and seller alike.\r\r\rSummary\r\r\rViolence peaks during the second decade of life. The youths who first became violent in\r\rchildhood escalate their violence in adolescence, and a larger group of young people embarks on\r\rviolence in adolescence. For some young people, violence represents a way of gaining the\r\rrespect of peers, enhancing their sense of self-worth, or declaring their independence from\r\radults. Violence drops off as adolescents enter adulthood and assume adult roles.\r\r\rParents' direct influence on behavior is largely supplanted in adolescence by peer influences.\r\rThus the most powerful peer predictors of violence in adolescence are weak social ties to\r\rconventional peers, ties to antisocial, delinquent peers, and belonging to a gang.\r\r\rUnexpected Findings and Effects\r\r\rThis chapter does not identify a number of characteristics and conditions frequently thought of as\r\rrisk factors. Furthermore, some of the risk factors that have been identified may exhibit smaller\r\reffect sizes than expected. There are two reasons for this. First, this report relies on longitudinal\r\rstudies, which identify risk factors and their effect sizes on the basis of their ability to predict\r\rfuture behavior. Much of this research involves identifying risks for aggression, externalizing\r\rbehavior, or antisocial behavior -- not risks for violence. While there is considerable overlap\r\rbetween the risk factors for aggression and those for violence, there are some important\r\rdifferences, particularly with respect to effect sizes (Hann & Borek, in press). Television\r\rviolence, for example, has a very large effect on aggressive behavior but only a small effect on\r\rviolence. Second, some studies that have been widely cited in the media involve cross-sectional\r\rand retrospective research designs, which are inappropriate for identifying factors that predict\r\rfuture violence.\r\r\rConduct disorder has been linked to youth violence in numerous studies, but the cluster of\r\rsymptoms used to determine this disorder includes physical aggressiveness, nonphysical\r\raggressiveness, and antisocial attitudes and beliefs. For purposes of predicting violence, the\r\rcritical question is: What components of this disorder actually confer risk? There is some\r\revidence that physical aggression accounts for most of the predictive power of conduct disorder\r\r(Nagin & Tremblay, 1999) and has a moderate to small effect size as a predictor of violence.\r\rAntisocial attitudes and beliefs also predict violence, but with an even smaller effect size. The\r\rthree components of conduct disorder generally cluster together, which accounts for their having\r\rbeen combined into a single risk factor in earlier studies. Other childhood disorders such as\r\nattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depressive and anxiety disorders, and their symptoms do\r\rnot cause violent behavior, but their presence often signals serious behavioral and emotional\r\rproblems that negatively affect family, social, and academic functioning, domains of risk for\r\rviolent behavior.\r\r\rRace has long been considered a risk factor for the onset of violence, and it is included as a risk\r\rfactor in most studies using simple bivariate predictors of violence. The question is whether race\r\rpredicts violence once other known risk factors are taken into account. Studies that have\r\raccounted for the effects of other known risk factors have typically found no significant effect of\r\rrace on youth violence (Elliott et al., 1989; Reiss & Roth, 1993; Roitberg & Menard, 1995).\r\rThus, race appears to be a risk marker rather than a risk factor. Race is a proxy for other known\r\rrisk factors -- living in poor, single-parent families, doing poorly at school, and being exposed to\r\rneighborhood disadvantage, gangs, violence, and crime. The evidence suggests that the link\r\rbetween race and violence is based largely on social and political distinctions rather than\r\rbiological differences.\r\r\rEthnicity has also been proposed as a risk factor, but it has not been studied extensively enough\r\rto include here. Young people from ethnic minorities may be subject to prejudice and thus to\r\rlimited opportunity, and they may face unique stresses when their family culture conflicts with\r\rthe dominant U.S. culture. At the same time, their ethnic culture may offer them strong support\r\rand guidance and thus function as a protective factor (APA, 1993).\r\r\rChild abuse is widely considered to be a powerful risk factor for youth violence. This belief is\r\rbased on a number of early studies that suffered from serious methodological problems (see\r\rDodge et al., 1990; Garbarino & Plantz, 1986; Howing et al., 1990; and Widom, 1989 for\r\rreviews). In more sophisticated, controlled longitudinal studies, the effects are much smaller (see\r\rTable 4-1), a finding that holds for both self-report and official record studies. In addition, studies\r\rreporting on child abuse as a predictor of nonviolent delinquent behavior or less serious offenses\r\rfind larger effect sizes than those cited here for violence or serious delinquency (Bolton et al.,\r\r1977; Smith & Thornberry, 1995; Widom, 1989, 1991; Zingraff et al., 1993, 1994). Neither\r\rsexual abuse nor physical abuse is a significant predictor of youth violence when considered\r\ralone (Hawkins et al., 1998c). Sexual abuse has been linked to criminal behavior in adulthood\r\r(Widom & Ames, 1994), but not to violence in adolescence.\r\r\rAlthough the effect size of child abuse or neglect is small when a correlation measure is used (as\r\rin Table 4-1), the relative risk of violence among abused or neglected children can be substantial.\r\rKnowing that a child was abused does not help much in predicting future violence, however,\r\rsince the vast majority of abused children do not become violent. For example, one longitudinal\r\rstudy showed that 5 percent of abused children were arrested for a violent crime by age 18,\r\rcompared to 3 percent of nonabused children (Widom, 1991). The relative risk of arrest for\r\rviolence is nearly twice as great in the abused group as in the nonabused group, yet the\r\rcorrelation for this relationship is .07, a small effect size. In other words, even though the6\r\rprobability of later violence is substantially higher among abused than nonabused youths in this\r\rstudy, the correlation is small because the majority of all youths (95 percent of abused and 97\r\rpercent of nonabused youths) did not become violent.\r\r\rWhen the proportion of youths who become violent is greater, the relative risks appear to be\r\rlower. Thus, when subjects in the 1991 Widom study were tracked to age 30, the relative risk of\r\nviolence dropped to 1.3 (Widom, 2000). In the one longitudinal self-report study to date, which\r\rhad relatively high proportions of abused children reporting violence, the relative risk of violence\r\rwas 1.2 (Smith & Thornberry, 1995). In both of these cases, the correlation was less than .10.\r\r\rHeredity does not seem to play a strong role in violence (see Cary, 1994 for a review). While\r\rthere is some evidence supporting a genetic effect, the proposed mechanisms are very complex\r\rand nonspecific (Turbin, 2000). Neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and GABA may\r\rplay a role in aggression, but so far their mechanisms of action are unclear and there is\r\rinsufficient evidence to consider them predictors of violence. In general, there are no known\r\rneurobiological patterns that are precise and specific enough to be considered reliable risk factors\r\rfor violent behavior (Reiss & Roth, 1993).\r\r\rDrug trafficking in early adolescence predicts later violence (Hawkins et al., 1998c; Herrenkohl\r\ret al., 2000; Huizinga et al., 1995; Menard et al., in press; Reiss & Roth, 1993). This risk factor\r\ris not included here because only one study presents correlations (or the data necessary to\r\rcalculate them); therefore, average effect size could not be estimated. In the Menard et al. study,\r\rthe correlation between selling marijuana and violence in adolescence was .33; for selling hard\r\rdrugs, it was .27. In the Hawkins et al. study, the odds ratio for selling drugs at age 14 and\r\rviolence at age 18 was 3.34; it was 4.55 for selling at age 16 and violence at age 18. Drug selling\r\rthus appears to have at least a moderate effect size.\r\r\rProposed Protective Factors in Childhood and Adolescence\r\r\rResearch on resilience and the public health approach to the problem of youth violence have\r\rbrought a new awareness of, and research on, protective factors -- those aspects of the individual\r\rand his or her environment that buffer or moderate the effect of risk. Identifying and\r\runderstanding how protective factors operate is potentially as important to violence prevention\r\rand intervention efforts as research on risk factors.\r\r\rTo date, the evidence regarding protective factors against violence has not met the standards\r\restablished for risk factors. Therefore, this report does not refer to protective factors, only to\r\rproposed protective factors (Table 4-2). There are several reasons for this: Not all studies define\r\rprotective factors as buffering the effects of risk; most studies have looked for an effect on\r\rantisocial behavior in general, not on violence specifically; and those that have found buffering\r\reffects on violence have not been adequately replicated. This does not mean that protective\r\rfactors do not exist, just that more research is needed to identify them.7\r\r\r\r          Table\r\r\r          Table 4-2. Proposed protective factors, evidence of buffering\r\r          risk, and outcome affected, by domain.\r\r\r\rMost studies of protective factors do not specify when in the course of development these factors\r\rexert their buffering effects or how they change over the life course. Further study is needed to\r\rclarify these points; therefore, Table 4-2 does not show age of onset for the proposed protective\r\rfactors listed.\r\r\rA Note on Sources\r\nThe authors of a 1995 longitudinal study on protective factors and their buffering effects on the\r\rrisk of problem behavior in adolescence (Jessor et al., 1995) recently reexamined their data to see\r\rwhether they could find any buffering effect specifically on violence. They did find a buffering\r\reffect, but their results must be considered preliminary until they are replicated by others.\r\rNonetheless, these findings are encouraging, since they indicate that several of the factors\r\ridentified as protective against problem behavior also provided a buffering effect against\r\rviolence. By implication, other studies that have demonstrated buffering effects on the risk of\r\rantisocial behavior or general delinquency (for example, Fergusson & Lynskey, 1996) may also\r\rcontain evidence of potential protective factors against violence. The discussion of proposed\r\rprotective factors in this report rests on the reanalysis of the 1995 study data (Turbin, 2000), as\r\rwell as on results from other studies, bearing in mind the caveats noted above.\r\r\rThe 1995 Jessor study grouped possible protective factors together and found that students who\r\rscored high on this index of protection were buffered from the effects of risk, compared to\r\rstudents who scored low on the index. The index was composed of seven psychosocial protective\r\rfactors: attitudinal intolerance of deviance, positive orientation to health, religiosity, positive\r\rrelations with adults, perceived consequences for misbehavior, friends as models for\r\rconventional behaviors, and high involvement in conventional activities. In an analysis of\r\rspecific factors, however, only two -- an intolerant attitude toward deviance and commitment to\r\rschool -- had significant protective effects. The new findings show that the same two factors\r\rappear to exert a significant, though small, buffering effect on risk factors for violence.\r\r\rProposed Protective Factors by Domain\r\r\rOne of the proposed protective factors shown to have a buffering effect on the risk of violence is\r\ran individual characteristic, and the other falls into the domain of school; both are classed as\r\rhaving a small effect. No other factors in the individual, family, school, or peer group domains\r\rhave been shown to exert significant buffering effects on risk factors for violence, although they\r\rhave been shown to moderate the risk of antisocial behavior or delinquency. No protective\r\rfactors have been proposed yet in the community domain.\r\r\rIndividual\r\r\rAn intolerant attitude toward deviance, including violent behavior, is the strongest proposed\r\rprotective factor. It reflects a commitment to traditional values and norms as well as disapproval\r\rof activities that violate these norms. Young people whose attitudes are antithetical to violence\r\rare unlikely to become involved in activities that could lead to violence or to associate with peers\r\rwho are delinquent or violent.\r\r\rThe four remaining individual factors have not yet been shown to moderate violence, although\r\rthey may buffer risks for antisocial behavior or general delinquency. High IQ has been cited as a\r\rpossible protective factor (Fergusson & Lynskey, 1996; Garmezy, 1985; Rutter, 1985; Werner &\r\rSmith, 1982). Children with above-average IQs may exhibit qualities, such as curiosity and\r\rcreativity, that help them make the most of early educational, artistic, and cultural experiences.\r\rAbove-average IQ can also help a child excel in school. High IQ may increase an adolescent's\r\rchances of benefiting from educational, creative, and cultural opportunities. For youths facing\r\rmultiple risk factors, exposure to the wider world may open a window on alternative values and\r\rlifestyles.\r\nBeing born female has also been cited (Garmezy, 1985; Rutter, 1985; Werner & Smith, 1982),\r\rbut it is the opposite of being born male, a risk factor, and as yet there is no evidence of a\r\rbuffering effect. Being a girl entails less exposure to violence, less impulsiveness and daring, and\r\rbeing expected to behave less aggressively than boys.\r\r\rSome studies have proposed positive social orientation as a protective factor (Garmezy, 1985;\r\rJessor et al., 1998; Rutter, 1985; Werner & Smith, 1982). Like commitment to school, a positive\r\rsocial orientation indicates that a young person has adopted traditional values and norms, a\r\rslightly different emphasis than intolerance of deviance. This proposed factor appears to be the\r\ropposite of antisocial attitudes and beliefs, a late-onset risk factor that has a small effect size.\r\r\rPerceived sanctions for transgressions, a protective factor in the earlier Jessor study (1995),\r\rrefers to perceived peer disapproval of deviant behavior. The reanalysis of those original data\r\rreveals that this proposed factor has no significant protective effect on risk of violence or\r\rproblem behavior.\r\r\rFamily\r\r\rThere is no doubt that an essential aspect of healthy child development is forming a secure\r\rattachment in infancy to a parent or other adult who senses and responds to a baby's needs (Bell\r\r& Fink, 2000). Likewise, researchers agree that having a loving adult who is interested in and\r\rsupportive of a child or young person's ideas and activities helps that child or adolescent develop\r\rthe confidence and competence needed to progress from one stage of development to the next.\r\rGood relations with an adult who supports conventional behavior and disapproves of delinquent\r\rbehavior can provide invaluable guidance for young people. The question is whether these\r\rrelationships moderate the effects of exposure to risk and thus fit the definition of a protective\r\rfactor.\r\r\rA warm, supportive relationship with parents or other adults has been shown to protect against\r\rantisocial behavior, but studies so far have not found a significant buffering effect on the risk of\r\rviolence (Hawkins et al., 1998c; Klein & Forehand, 2000; Rutter, 1979; Turbin, 2000; Werner &\r\rSmith, 1992).\r\r\rIt is uncertain whether family protective factors, like family risk factors, become less influential\r\ras young people progress through adolescence. Parental support and encouragement remain\r\rimportant, but even parents who have had a good relationship with their children before puberty\r\rmay affect their adolescents' behavior only indirectly -- for example, through choice of friends\r\r(Elliott et al., 1989). This indirect influence is not inconsequential, however; associating with\r\rpeers who disapprove of violence may inhibit later violence in young people (Hawkins et al.,\r\r1998c), and parents' positive evaluation of peers has been found to reduce the risk of delinquency\r\r(Smith et al., 1995).\r\r\rSeveral studies have pointed to monitoring or supervision of activities as a protective factor\r\ragainst delinquency and antisocial behavior, but this is essentially the opposite of failure to\r\rmonitor, an adolescent-onset risk factor with a small effect size. To date, no evidence of\r\rmoderating effects on the risk of violence has been presented (Baldwin et al., 1990; Klein &\r\rForehand, 2000; Smith et al., 1995).\r\r\rSchool\r\nCommitment to school is the second proposed protective factor that has been found to buffer the\r\rrisk of youth violence. Young people who are committed to school have embraced the goals and\r\rvalues of an influential social institution. Such young people are unlikely to engage in violence,\r\rboth because it is incompatible with their orientation and because it would jeopardize their\r\rachievement in school and their standing with adults (Jessor et al., 1995; Turbin, 2000). This\r\rproposed factor is included because it appears to buffer the risk of violence, not because it is the\r\ropposite of poor attitude toward or performance in school, a risk factor with small effect sizes in\r\rboth childhood and adolescence.\r\r\rSchool can give adolescents who face multiple risk factors a place in which to excel socially and\r\racademically. Achievement in school and the approval of teachers provide the recognition so\r\rimportant to adolescent development -- recognition some adolescents do not receive from other\r\rsources. Encouragement from teachers can give young people the confidence to seek continued\r\reducational or job skills training. In addition, schools with peer groups that value academic\r\rachievement may lower students' risk of becoming involved in violence (Felson et al., 1994).\r\rUnfortunately, schools with a culture of violence may be unable to exert their very important\r\rprotective function.\r\r\rExtracurricular activities in art, music, drama, school publications, and the like give adolescents\r\ran opportunity to participate in constructive group activities and achieve recognition for their\r\refforts. Studies have found that recognition for or involvement in conventional activities --\r\rwhether family, school, extracurricular, religious, or community -- is a protective factor against\r\rantisocial behavior (Jessor et al., 1995; Rae-Grant et al., 1989). The reanalysis of the Jessor data\r\rshows that involvement in family, volunteer, and school club activities other than sports has an\r\rinsignificant effect on risk for violence (Turbin, 2000).\r\r\rPeer Group\r\r\rHaving friends who behave conventionally is a proposed protective factor that seems to reduce\r\rthe risk of delinquency, but there is no evidence of a true buffering effect on specific risk factors.\r\rBuffering effects on violence were not significant in the reanalysis of the Jessor data (Turbin,\r\r2000; see also Smith et al., 1995). However, as noted earlier, researchers have found that\r\rassociating with peers who disapprove of violence may inhibit violence in young people\r\r(Hawkins et al., 1998c; Jessor et al., 1995).\r\r\rSummary\r\r\rAlthough the body of research on protective factors is growing, very little work has been done\r\rspecifically on protective factors that buffer the risk of violence. Some researchers have\r\ridentified individual and environmental characteristics that can be considered candidates for\r\rprotective factors. Lacking adequate scientific evidence of the nature, mechanism, size, and\r\rtiming of these candidates' moderating effects, however, this report considers all of them\r\rproposed protective factors.\r\r\rOne recent reanalysis of earlier data has found two proposed protective factors that seem to\r\rbuffer the risk of violence -- an intolerant attitude toward deviance and commitment to school.\r\rThese two factors appear to exert a statistically significant, though small, buffering effect on the\r\rrisk of violence, but until these findings are replicated, they must be considered preliminary.\r\nIdentifying and understanding how protective factors operate is as important to preventing and\r\rstopping violence as identifying and understanding risk factors. This area of the public health\r\rapproach to youth violence cries out for more research.\r\r\rConclusions\r\r\rScientists have identified a number of personal characteristics and environmental conditions that\r\rput children and adolescents at risk of violent behavior and some that seem to protect them from\r\rthe effects of risk. These risk and protective factors can be found in every area of life, they exert\r\rdifferent effects at different stages of development, they tend to appear in clusters, and they\r\rappear to gain strength in numbers. The public health approach to youth violence involves\r\ridentifying risk and protective factors, determining when in the life course they typically come\r\rinto play, designing preventive programs that can be put in place at just the right time to be most\r\reffective, and making the public aware of these findings.\r\r\rMany years of research have yielded valuable insights into the risk factors involved in the onset\r\rand developmental course of violence. Less work has been done on protective factors, but that\r\rsituation is changing. Some basic principles have emerged from these studies:\r\r\rRisk and protective factors exist in every area of life -- individual, family, school, peer\r\rgroup, and community. Individual characteristics interact in complex ways with a child's\r\ror adolescent's environment to produce violent behavior.\r\r\rRisk and protective factors vary in predictive power depending on when in the course of\r\rhuman development they occur. As children move from infancy to early adulthood,\r\rsome risk factors will become more important and others less important. Substance use,\r\rfor example, is a far more powerful risk factor at age 9 than it is at age 14.\r\r\rRisk factors do not operate in isolation -- the more risk factors a child or young person\r\ris exposed to, the greater the likelihood that he or she will become violent. Risk factors\r\rcan be buffered by protective factors, however. An adolescent with an intolerant attitude\r\rtoward violence is unlikely to engage in violence, even if he or she is associating with\r\rdelinquent peers, a major risk factor for violence at that age.\r\r\rRisk factors increase the likelihood that a young person will become violent, but they\r\rmay not actually cause a young person to become violent. Scientists view them as\r\rreliable predictors or even as probable causes of youth violence. They are useful for\r\ridentifying vulnerable populations that may be amenable to intervention efforts.\r\r\rRisk markers such as race or ethnicity are frequently confused with risk factors; risk\r\rmarkers have no causal relation to violence.\r\r\rNo single risk factor or combination of factors can predict violence with unerring\r\raccuracy. Few young people exposed to a single risk factor will become involved in\r\rviolent behavior; similarly, most young people exposed to multiple risks will not\r\rbecome violent. By the same token, protective factors cannot guarantee that a child\r\rexposed to risk will not become violent.\r\r\rResearchers have identified at least two onset trajectories for youth violence: a\r\rchildhood trajectory that begins before puberty and an adolescent one that begins after\r\npuberty. Violence peaks during the second decade of life. The small group of offenders\r\rwho began their violent behavior in childhood commits more violent offenses, and the\r\rlarger group of adolescent offenders begins to become involved in violence.\r\r\rEarly risk factors for violence in adolescence include involvement in serious (but not\r\rnecessarily violent) criminal acts and substance use before puberty, being male,\r\raggressiveness, low family socioeconomic status/poverty, and antisocial parents. All of\r\rthese early risks stem from a child's individual characteristics and interaction with his or\r\rher family. The influence of family is largely supplanted in adolescence by peer\r\rinfluences; thus, risk factors with the largest predictive effects in adolescence include\r\rweak social ties to conventional peers, ties to antisocial or delinquent peers, and\r\rbelonging to a gang. Committing serious (but not necessarily violent) criminal offenses\r\ris also an important risk factor in adolescence. Drug selling is a risk factor, but its effect\r\rsize has not been established.\r\r\rIdentifying and understanding how protective factors operate is potentially as important\r\rto preventing and stopping violence as identifying and understanding risk factors.\r\rSeveral protective factors have been proposed, but to date only two have been found to\r\rbuffer the risk of violence -- an intolerant attitude toward deviance and commitment to\r\rschool. Protective factors warrant more research attention.\r\r\rViolence prevention and intervention efforts hinge on identifying risk and protective factors and\r\rdetermining when in the course of development they emerge. More research in these areas is\r\rneeded, particularly concerning why violence stops or continues in childhood and adolescence.\r\rNonetheless, the research carried out to date provides a solid foundation for programs aimed at\r\rreducing risk factors and promoting protective ones -- and thereby preventing violence, the\r\rsubject of Chapter 5.\r\r\rReferences\r\r\r1.

The body of research on television\r\rviolence has grown tremendously since the first major Federal reports on the subject in 1972 and\r\r1982 (National Institute of Mental Health, 1982; U.S. Surgeon General's Scientific Advisory\r\rCommittee on Television and Social Behavior, 1972). During this period, new media emerged --\r\rvideo games, cable television, music videos, and the Internet. As they gained popularity, these\r\rmedia, along with television, prompted public concern and research attention.\r\r\rRecent surveys depict the abundance of (primarily electronic) media in U.S. homes (Roberts et\r\ral., 1999; Woodard, 1998) and the extensive presence of violence within the media landscape\r\r(Wilson et al., 1997, 1998). They also show that the proliferation of new media has expanded the\r\ropportunities for children to be exposed to media violence at home. Current psychological theory\r\rsuggests that the interactive nature of many of these new media may affect children's behavior\r\rmore powerfully than passive media such as television. Research to test this assumption is not\r\ryet well developed, and accurate measurement is needed to determine how much violence\r\rchildren are actually exposed to through various media -- and how patterns of exposure vary\r\ramong American youths.\r\r\rIn reading this discussion of research on the impact of media violence on America's youth, a few\r\rmajor points should be kept in mind:\r\r\rFirst, research on the effects of media violence examines many kinds of outcomes in\r\ryoung people. Researchers have focused primarily on aggression, an outcome that\r\rpsychologists define as any behavior, physical or verbal, that is intended to harm\r\ranother person. Physical aggression may range from less serious acts, such as pushing\r\ror shoving, to more serious physical contact and fighting, to very serious violent acts\r\rthat carry a significant risk of injury or death, such as assault, robbery, rape, and\r\rhomicide. Some studies have focused on how media violence affects aggressive\r\rthinking, including beliefs and attitudes. Other studies have focused on the effects of\r\nmedia violence on aggressive emotions -- that is, on emotional reactions, such as anger,\r\rthat are related to aggressive behavior. In this discussion, the label \"violence\" is reserved\r\rfor the most extreme end of the physical aggression spectrum.\r\r\rSecond, as noted in Chapter 4, the preponderance of evidence indicates that violent\r\rbehavior seldom results from a single cause; rather, multiple factors converging over\r\rtime contribute to such behavior. Accordingly, the influence of the mass media, however\r\rstrong or weak, is best viewed as one of the many potential factors that help to shape\r\rbehavior, including violent behavior.\r\r\rThird, a developmental perspective is essential for understanding how media violence\r\raffects youth behavior and for framing any coherent public health response to it.\r\rAlthough this report focuses generally on the violent behavior of adolescents, it is\r\rcritical to understand how children are influenced by and respond to media violence,\r\respecially in order to recognize and help those who are particularly susceptible to\r\radverse effects. Most youths who are aggressive and engage in some forms of antisocial\r\rbehavior do not become violent teens and adults. However, it is well established that\r\rmany violent adolescents and adults were highly aggressive and even violent at younger\r\rages, and the highly aggressive child is at increased risk of growing up to be a more\r\raggressive young adult (Nagin & Tremblay, 1999). Because influences that promote\r\raggressive behavior in some young children can contribute to increasingly aggressive\r\rand even violent behavior many years later, it is important to understand the early\r\rfactors that may play a role in later outcomes.\r\r\rFourth, a growing body of research supports theories that explain how exposure to\r\rmedia violence would activate aggressive behaviors or attitudes in some children.\r\rHumans begin imitating other individuals at a very early age, and young children learn\r\rmany motor and social skills by observing the behavior of others (Bandura, 1977).\r\rSocial interactions shape the scripts for behavior that children acquire, but observational\r\rlearning is a powerful mechanism for acquiring social scripts throughout childhood\r\r(Huesmann, 1998). Most researchers agree that such observational learning is probably\r\rthe major psychological process underlying the effects of media violence on aggressive\r\rbehavior. This same process could explain how prosocial behavior depicted in the media\r\rmight encourage positive behavior in children (Friedlander, 1993; Harold, 1986; Mares,\r\r1996).\r\r\rMedia Violence: Exposure and Content\r\r\rAmerican children and youths spend, on average, more than 4 hours a day with television,\r\rcomputers, videotaped movies, and video games (Roberts et al., 1999; Woodard, 2000). But their\r\rexposure to media varies considerably, depending on their age, parental viewing habits, and\r\rfamily socioeconomic status (SES). Most systematic research on children's exposure to violent\r\rmedia dates back to the 1970s, when most families did not have access to cable television, music\r\rvideos, video games, or the Internet. As noted earlier, very few contemporary studies\r\rsystematically document children's actual consumption of violent media; this is particularly true\r\rfor the newer media.\r\r\rSeveral content analyses over the last 30 years have systematically examined violence on\r\ntelevision (Gerbner et al., 1980; Potter et al., 1995; Signorielli, 1990). The largest and most\r\rrecent of these was the National Television Violence Survey (NTVS) (Wilson et al., 1997,1\r\r1998), which examined the amount and content of violence on American television for three2\r\rconsecutive years, as well as contextual variables that may make it more likely for aggression\r\rand violence to be accepted, learned, and imitated. Smith and Donnerstein (1998) report the\r\rfollowing NTVS findings:\r\r\r61 percent of television programs contain some violence, and only 4 percent of\r\rtelevision programs with violent content feature an \"antiviolence\" theme.\r\r\r44 percent of the violent interactions on television involve perpetrators who have some\r\rattractive qualities worthy of emulation.\r\r\r43 percent of violent scenes involve humor either directed at the violence or used by\r\rcharacters involved with violence.\r\r\rNearly 75 percent of violent scenes on television feature no immediate punishment for\r\ror condemnation of violence.\r\r\r40 percent of programs feature \"bad\" characters who are never or rarely punished for\r\rtheir aggressive actions.\r\r\rThe NTVS report notes that many television programs fail to depict the harmful consequences of\r\rviolence. Specifically, it finds that of all violent behavioral interactions on television, 58 percent\r\rdepict no pain, 47 percent depict no harm, and 40 percent depict harm unrealistically. Of all\r\rviolent scenes on television, 86 percent feature no blood or gore. Only 16 percent of violent\r\rprograms feature the long-term, realistic consequences of violence.\r\r\rMajor Behavioral Effects of Media Violence\r\r\rBecause an exhaustive description of the research literature is not possible within this brief\r\rdiscussion, findings from meta-analyses are reported where available. In meta-analyses, the3\r\rresults of multiple studies are combined and compared systematically and an overall effect size\r\rcomputed. These analyses include findings from randomized experiments that look at aggression\r\rimmediately after viewing violence, as well as cross-sectional surveys that provide a snapshot of\r\rthe relationship between viewing violence and behavior at a fixed point in time. Also presented\r\rare findings from longitudinal studies that examine whether exposure to media violence affects\r\rviolence and aggression over time.\r\r\rTelevision and Film Violence\r\r\rMany anecdotal reports have described instances in which television and film violence led to\r\rimmediate violent behavior in individual children, but scientific studies of this relationship draw\r\ra more complex and qualified picture. Most of the relevant research has focused on how\r\rwatching dramatic violence on television and film affects aggressive thoughts and emotions, as\r\rwell as aggressive behavior. Some important studies address violence as well.\r\r\rExperimental Studies\r\r\rA substantial number of laboratory and field experiments over the past half-century have\r\rexamined whether children exposed to violent behavior on film or television behave more\r\naggressively immediately afterwards (see reviews by Bushman & Huesmann, 2000; Comstock &\r\rScharrer, 1999; Geen, 1990; Geen & Thomas, 1986; Huesmann et al., 1997). Many studies have\r\ralso examined the immediate effect of media violence on aggressive thoughts or emotions (Rule\r\r& Ferguson, 1986), which have been shown to increase the risk of aggressive behavior (Dodge &\r\rFrame, 1982; Huesmann & Guerra, 1997).\r\r\rThe most recent and comprehensive meta-analysis of media violence was conducted by Paik and\r\rComstock (1994), who examined effect sizes from 217 empirical studies on media violence and\r\raggressive and violent behavior published between 1957 and 1990. The analysis indicates clearly\r\rthat brief exposure to violent dramatic presentations on television or in films causes short-term\r\rincreases in the aggressive behavior of youths, including physically aggressive behavior. Across\r\rall the randomized experiments, the unweighted average effect size was large (r = .37). When4\r\ronly experiments examining physical aggression as the outcome were examined, the effect size\r\rwas also large (r = .32).\r\r\rAlthough the experimental methods used in these studies enable researchers to test causality\r\rmore readily than other research methods as noted by Comstock and Paik (1991), the findings\r\rmay not necessarily apply to all real-world settings. Because experiments are narrowly focused\r\ron testing specific causal hypotheses, they do not examine the effects of all factors that might be\r\rpresent in more realistic situations. This means that some real-world influences might actually\r\rlessen or even eliminate the aggressive reactions observed in experiments. For example, while\r\rtelevision, film, and other media contain a variety of antisocial and other messages, most\r\rlaboratory studies to date have exposed study participants primarily to violent materials. In\r\raddition, participants may react differently in the laboratory when they realize that their\r\rexpressions of aggression will not be punished (Gunter, 1983). Any summary of these\r\rexperimental results should also acknowledge the argument raised by some critics (such as\r\rFreedman, 1992) that many study participants provide the responses they believe the researcher\r\rwants. Despite these limitations, laboratory experiments are important because they allow\r\rresearchers to isolate the unique effect of exposure to violence on subsequent behavior.\r\r\rAn important general finding from these experimental studies is that not all youths seem to be\r\raffected equally by media violence. Effects seem to be strongest on youths who are predisposed\r\rto be aggressive for some reason or who have been aroused or provoked (Berkowitz, 1993;\r\rBushman, 1995; Geen & O'Neal, 1969).\r\r\rCross-Sectional Surveys\r\r\rCross-sectional surveys over the past 40 years have generally focused on establishing a link\r\rbetween the current aggressiveness of children and the amount of television and film violence\r\rthey watch regularly (see reviews by Bushman & Huesmann, 2000; Chaffee, 1972; Comstock &\r\rScharrer, 1999; Eysenck & Nias, 1978; Huesmann & Miller, 1994).\r\r\rPaik and Comstock's meta-analysis (1994) indicates that in cross-sectional surveys viewing\r\rmedia violence was positively correlated with various measures of aggression. They reported\r\rsmall to moderate effect sizes across all measures of aggression (r = .19) and for physical\r\raggression alone (r = .20). For the outcome of most concern to this report -- criminal violence\r\ragainst a person -- the effect size was small (r = .06). These results suggest that the link between\r\rmedia violence and aggressive behavior found in laboratory studies may also hold for behaviors\r\noutside the laboratory. However, cross-sectional surveys do not by themselves indicate whether\r\rmedia violence is causing aggression, whether aggressive youths are attracted to media violence,\r\ror whether some other factor is predisposing some youths to watch more violence and behave\r\rmore aggressively.\r\r\rLongitudinal Studies\r\r\rLong-term studies in which exposure to media violence in early childhood is related to later\r\raggression and violence (such as aggravated assault, robbery, rape, and homicide) can identify\r\rthe enduring effects of media violence. In most such studies to date, however, aggression, not\r\rviolence, has been the primary outcome measured. In the absence of a meta-analysis, the findings\r\rof three frequently cited longitudinal studies on the effects of media violence are discussed\r\rbriefly below. Studies examining effects over shorter time periods (Singer et al., 1984) or with\r\rinternational samples (Huesmann & Eron, 1986) are not included here.\r\r\rIn a study begun in 1960 on a sample of 875 youths in New York State, Eron and colleagues\r\rfound that for boys, but not for girls, exposure to media violence at age 8 was significantly\r\rrelated to aggressive behavior a decade later (r = .31, N = 211, p < .01) (Eron et al., 1972;\r\rLefkowitz et al., 1977). At both times, peers assessed physical and verbal aggression. The\r\rlongitudinal correlation remained above .25, even in separate analyses statistically controlling for\r\rfactors such as the child's initial aggressiveness, the child's intelligence, family SES, parents'\r\raggressiveness, and parents' punishment and nurturance of the child.\r\r\rMilavsky et al. (1982) examined the probability of initiating aggression after exposure to\r\rviolence on television in 2,400 boys and girls age 7 to 12 from two midwestern cities who had\r\rbeen surveyed up to six times between 1970 and 1973. A sample of 800 teenage boys was5\r\rstudied at five times to identify the effect of violent television on aggression and violence. For\r\rthe elementary school sample, the average cross-sectional correlation between exposure to media\r\rviolence and personal aggression was small for boys (r = .17) and large for girls (r = .30). The\r\rresearchers then attempted to predict aggressive behavior at one point in time from the extent to\r\rwhich children viewed television violence at an earlier time, while controlling for earlier\r\raggressive characteristics. They examined this prediction over 15 time intervals ranging from 5\r\rmonths to 3 years apart. For elementary school boys, only 2 of the 15 predictions at different\r\rintervals were statistically significant. For girls, only three predictions were statistically\r\rsignificant. In the teenage male sample, only one of eight correlations was significant. In only\r\rone of nine analyses using measures of violence (for example, knife fight, car theft, mugging,\r\rgang fight) were boys with greater exposure to television violence more likely to initiate violence\r\r2 years later than those with less exposure.\r\r\rThe third longitudinal study of media violence effects began in the late 1970s and spanned five\r\rcountries (Huesmann et al., (submitted); Huesmann et al., 1984; Huesmann & Eron, 1986). In\r\reach locale, samples of middle-class youths were examined three times between age 6 to 8 or age\r\r8 to 11. Both physical and verbal aggression were assessed by peers. The correlations between\r\raggression and overall viewing of television violence at a single point in time were small to\r\rmoderate and often significant. In the United States, the 3-year average correlation was moderate\r\rfor boys and for girls (r = .25 and r = .29, respectively; p< .001). The predictive power of\r\rviewing television violence for childhood aggression a year later varied substantially. In the\r\rUnited States, girls' viewing of television violence had a significant effect (   = .17, N = 89, p <\r\n.05) on their later aggression, even after accounting for early levels of aggression, SES, and\r\rscholastic achievement. For boys, television violence alone did not predict later aggression.\r\rWhen the investigators took into account both exposure to television violence and identification\r\rwith aggressive television characters, they found a positive relation with aggressiveness (   = .19,\r\rN = 84, p < .05).\r\r\rA follow-up study of over 300 people in the U.S. sample 15 years later suggested that media\r\rviolence has a delayed effect on aggression (Huesmann et al., (submitted)). There was a small to\r\rmoderate longitudinal correlation between childhood television viewing and a composite\r\rmeasure of young adult aggression (physical, verbal, and indirect aggression) for both men (r =\r\r.21, N = 153, p < .01) and women (r = .19, N = 176, p < .01). When the outcome was limited to\r\rphysical aggression, the correlations were smaller (r = .17 and r = .15, respectively).\r\rFurthermore, women who had watched relatively more television violence as girls committed\r\rsignificantly more specific acts of violence as adults, such as \"punching, beating, or choking\r\ranother adult,\" than did the other women (17 percent versus 4 percent). There were no significant\r\rdifferences among the men. Other analyses showed that effects remained significant even when\r\rresearchers controlled for parent education and children's scholastic achievement (   = .19 for\r\rboys,    = .17 for girls, p < .05). In addition, aggressive behavior did not significantly increase\r\rboys' or girls' viewing of television violence (   = .08 for boys and    = .04 for girls; p = ns).\r\r\rIn summary, these longitudinal studies show a small, but often statistically significant, long-term\r\rrelationship between viewing television violence in childhood and later aggression, especially in\r\rlate adolescence and early adulthood. Some evidence suggests that more aggressive children\r\rwatch more violence, but the evidence is stronger that watching media violence is a precursor of\r\rincreased aggression.\r\r\rOther Studies\r\r\rOther studies have explored the behavioral impact of introducing television in several countries\r\r(Centerwall, 1989a, 1989b, 1992; Joy et al., 1986; Williams, 1986). These studies indicate that\r\rwhen television was introduced, aggression and violence increased. The findings must be viewed\r\rwith caution, however, because they do not take into account a range of other factors that may\r\rinfluence national crime rates and the amount of violence watched on television.\r\r\rDespite anecdotal reports of a \"contagion of violence,\" relatively little systematic research has\r\rexamined whether seeing or hearing about violence in news coverage encourages violent or\r\raggressive behavior. On the whole, the limited data available support the notion of a contagion\r\reffect. This evidence is derived from studies examining how reports of a well-known person's\r\rsuicide affect the likelihood of imitative suicide (Phillips, 1979, 1982; Simon, 1979; Stack,\r\r1989). Other studies of the contagion effect (Berkowitz & Macaulay, 1971; Phillips, 1983) have\r\rbeen questioned because of their research methods and the ambiguity of their results (Baron &\r\rReiss, 1985; see Phillips & Bollen, 1985 for a response). This area merits additional research.\r\r\rViolence in Other Media\r\r\rInternet\r\r\rTheoretically, the effects of exposure to media violence extend to Internet media as well. To date,\r\rhowever, no studies have been published regarding the effects of Web-based media violence on\r\nyouth aggression and violence.\r\r\rMusic Videos\r\r\rA relatively small amount of research has focused on the impact of music videos with violent or\r\rantisocial themes (Baxter et al., 1985; Caplan, 1985; Hansen & Hansen, 1990; Johnson et al.,\r\r1995a, 1995b; Rich et al., 1998). Randomized experiments indicate that exposure to violent or\r\rantisocial rap videos can increase aggressive thinking, but no research has yet tested how such\r\rexposure directly affects physical aggression.\r\r\rVideo Games\r\r\rThe impact of video games containing violence has recently become a focus of research because\r\rchildren are theoretically more susceptible to behavioral influences when they are active\r\rparticipants than when they are observers. To date, violent video games have not been studied as\r\rextensively as violent television or movies. The number of studies investigating the impact of\r\rsuch games on youth aggression is small, there have been none on serious violence, and none has\r\rbeen longitudinal.\r\r\rA recent meta-analysis of these studies found that the overall effect size for both randomized and\r\rcorrelational studies was small for physical aggression (r = .19) and moderate for aggressive\r\rthinking (r = .27) (Anderson & Bushman, in press). In separate analyses, the effect sizes for both\r\rrandomized and cross-sectional studies was small (r = .18 and .19, respectively). The impact of\r\rvideo games on violent behavior remains to be determined.\r\r\rPotential Moderators of Behavioral Effects\r\r\rResearch suggests that not all youths are affected in the same way by viewing media violence.\r\rFactors that appear to influence the effects of media violence on aggressive or violent behavior\r\rinclude characteristics of the viewer (such as age, intelligence, aggressiveness, and whether the\r\rchild perceives the media as realistic and identifies with aggressive characters) and his or her\r\rsocial environment (for example, parental influences), as well as aspects of media content\r\r(including characteristics of perpetrators, degree of realism and justification for violence, and\r\rdepiction of consequences of violence).\r\r\rEvidence that these factors moderate the influence of media violence is limited, and it is more\r\rrelevant to aggression than to violence. For example, studies of responses to violent television\r\rand films and violent video games have found that people who were initially more aggressive\r\rthan other subjects were more affected in behavior, thoughts, and emotions (Anderson & Dill,\r\r2000; Bushman, 1995; Bushman & Geen, 1990; Friedrich & Stein, 1973; Josephson, 1987).\r\rResearch in this area clearly suggests that the impact of violent television, film, and video games\r\ron aggression is moderated by viewers' aggressive characteristics.\r\r\rEvidence that other individual, environmental, and content factors moderate the effects of\r\rexposure to media violence is less clear. Some studies suggest that these factors may buffer or\r\renhance effects, but few have tested for such influences. Although limited in scope and depth,\r\rsuch studies provide clues to potential avenues for prevention efforts. For example, preliminary\r\rdata point to the potentially vital role of parents in supervising their children's exposure to\r\rviolent media and in helping them interpret it (Nathanson, 1999).\r\nSummary of Major Empirical Research Findings\r\r\rA substantial body of research now indicates that exposure to media violence increases children's\r\rphysically and verbally aggressive behavior in the short term (within hours to days of exposure).\r\rMedia violence also increases aggressive attitudes and emotions, which are theoretically linked\r\rto aggressive and violent behavior. Findings from a smaller body of longitudinal studies suggest\r\ra small but statistically significant impact on aggression over many years. The evidence for long-\r\rterm effects on violence is inconsistent.\r\r\rBased on the findings of studies reported here, the average effect sizes of exposure to media\r\rviolence on various measures of aggression range from small (r = .15) to quite large (r = .64).\r\rThe evidence that exposure to media violence is a risk factor for violent behavior is more limited,\r\rwith small average effect sizes of r = .06 in cross-sectional surveys, r = .13 in experimental\r\rstudies (Paik & Comstock, 1994), and r = .00 to .22 in longitudinal studies (Huesmann et al.,\r\r(submitted); Milavsky et al., 1982). Taken together, findings to date suggest that media violence\r\rhas a relatively small impact on violence. The effect on aggression is stronger, ranging from\r\rsmall to moderate.\r\r\rAlthough there is clear scientific evidence of a correlation between exposure to media violence\r\rand some violent behaviors, randomized experiments -- the research methodology best suited to\r\rdetermining causality -- cannot ethically be used in studies of violent behavior. Thus, the causal\r\rlinks between media violence and behavior are more firmly established for aggressive behavior\r\rthan for violent behavior. Longitudinal studies, which also provide some insights into this issue,\r\rhave linked repeated exposure to media violence in the early years with an increased likelihood\r\rof aggressive behavior in the teen and adult years. However, few of these studies have reported\r\ron violence as an outcome. Moreover, the violent behaviors that are the focus of this report\r\r(homicide, forcible rape, aggravated assault, and robbery) occur infrequently and are subject to\r\rmultiple influences. At present, it is extremely difficult to distinguish between the relatively\r\rsmall, long-term effects of media exposure and those other influences.\r\r\rIn sum, a diverse body of research provides strong evidence that exposure to violence in the\r\rmedia can increase children's aggressive behavior in the short term. Some studies suggest that\r\rlong-term effects exist, and there are strong theoretical reasons why this is the case. But many\r\rquestions remain regarding the short- and long-term effects of media violence, especially on\r\rviolent behavior. Despite considerable advances in research, it is not yet possible to describe\r\raccurately how much exposure, of what types, for how long, at what ages, for what types of\r\rchildren, or in what types of settings will predict violent behavior in adolescents and adults.\r\r\rPreventive Efforts\r\r\rEfforts to reduce the presumed harmful effects of media violence on youths have taken various\r\rforms, including:\r\r\rAttempting to reduce the amount of media violence and children's access to it (for\r\rexample, calls for media self-regulation and violence ratings);\r\r\rEncouraging and facilitating parental monitoring of children's access to media (for\r\rexample, V-chip legislation and advisory labels on music and video games);\r\r\rEducating parents and children about the potential dangers of media violence (for\r\nexample, media and empathy educational programs); and\r\r\rTargeting children's views about violence to reduce the chances that they will imitate the\r\rviolence they see (Corder-Bolz, 1980; Hicks, 1968; Huesmann et al., 1983; Linz et al.,\r\r1990; Nathanson, 1999).\r\r\rFrom a public health perspective, this preventive domain is largely uncharted territory. Few\r\rpreventive efforts have been studied systematically. Furthermore, not enough research has been\r\rdone to form a basis for the design of many experimental interventions. As noted in other parts\r\rof this report, an extensive body of scientific research undergirds our emerging knowledge about\r\reffective ways of preventing youth violence. Although many violence prevention programs\r\raddress a complex array of risk and protective factors in the lives of young people, they have not\r\ryet addressed the role of the media. This gap needs to be filled.\r\r\rImplications\r\r\rResearch to date justifies sustained efforts to curb the adverse effects of media violence on\r\ryouths. Although our knowledge is incomplete, it is sufficient to develop a coherent public\r\rhealth approach to violence prevention that builds upon what is known, even as more research is\r\runder way. Unlike earlier Federal research reports on media violence and youth (National\r\rInstitute of Mental Health, 1982; U.S. Surgeon General's Scientific Advisory Committee on\r\rTelevision and Social Behavior, 1972), this discussion takes place within a broader examination\r\rof the causes and prevention of youth violence. This context is vital. It permits media violence to\r\rbe regarded as one of many complex influences on the behavior of America's children and young\r\rpeople. It also suggests that multilayered solutions are needed to address aggressive and violent\r\rbehavior.\r\r\rA variety of media violence is present in the homes of young children, with considerable\r\rvariation in the degree of parental supervision (Woodard, 1998). Regardless of government and\r\rother interested groups' attempts to limit the amount of violence reaching American families,\r\rfamilies themselves play a critical role in guiding what reaches their children. Whether by\r\radopting V-chip technology for home television programming, by using Internet violence\r\rscreening, or simply by monitoring closely children's use of televisions, computers, and video\r\rgames, parents can limit and shape their children's selection of, interaction with, and response to\r\rmedia violence. Community groups -- including schools, faith-based organizations, and Parent\r\rTeacher Associations -- can teach parents and children how to be more critical consumers of\r\rmedia. Federal agencies can be more active in encouraging needed research, in sharing research\r\rfindings with the public, in encouraging increased interaction between violence prevention\r\rresearchers and media researchers, and in creating networks for sharing solutions to social and\r\rpublic health problems.\r\r\rReferences\r\r\r1.

However,\r\rthe conditions and characteristics identified as protective factors by those using the absence-of-risk\r\rconceptualization rarely, if ever, involve a nonlinear relationship to violence.\r\r\r2As noted in Chapter 3, most violent offenders commit many serious property offenses (such as burglary,\r\rauto theft, and larceny), and most youths involved in serious property offenses (FBI index offenses) are also\r\rinvolved in violent offenses. The risk factors described here are based on longitudinal studies that use self-\r\rreports to predict violent offenses. Several of the studies also include official arrest data and thus predict\r\rself-reported offenses, arrests for serious or violent offenses, or both.\r\r\r3Effect sizes for risk factors not included in the meta-analyses reported by Lipsey and Derzon (1988),\r\rHawkins et al. (1998c), and Parik and Comstock (1994) are weighted (by sample size) mean correlations.\r\rThe effect sizes in Parik and Comstock are unweighted mean correlations.\r\r\r4Numerous studies of these effects have been done, notably those of Robert Pynoos and colleagues. See, for\r\rexample, Pynoos, R. & Nader K. (1988). Psychological first aid for children who witness community\r\rviolence. Journal of Traumatic Stress, 1, 445-473.\r\r\r5This is a different use of the term \"risk marker\" than that proposed by Kraemer et al. (1997). They use risk\r\rmarker to refer to a risk factor or cause (such as sex or race) that cannot, in practical terms, be changed by\r\ran intervention. This report focuses on its causal role rather than its amenability to change.\r\r\r6In another study, the relative risk of later violence was two to three times as great among abused children as\r\rnonabused children (Zingraff et al., 1993).\r\r\r7There is a fairly extensive body of research on protective factors in the field of psychopathology (Garmezy,\r\r1985; Rae-Grant et al., 1989; Rolf et al., 1993; Rutter, 1979, 1985; Rutter et al., 1979; Stattin et al., 1997;\r\rWerner and Smith, 1982, 1992). There are also a number of studies focusing on delinquency that purport to\r\ridentify protective factors (Brewer et al., 1995; Farrington and West, 1993; Hawkins et al., 1992; Resnick et\r\ral., 1997; Smith et al., 1995).\r\r\r1The NTVS randomly sampled programs from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. on 23 broadcast and cable channels\r\rover a 20-week period from October to June during the 1994 through 1997 viewing seasons. A sum of 119\r\rhours per channel, or 2,500 hours of television programming, was assessed each year.\r\r\r2The NTVS defined violence as \"overt depiction of a credible threat of physical force, or the actual use of\r\rsuch force intended to physically harm an animate being or group of beings.\" Content analyses of television\r\rprograms generally treat the program itself as the unit of analysis and exclude advertisements. \"Violence\r\ralso includes certain depictions of physically harmful consequences against an animate being or group that\r\roccur as a result of unseen violent means. Thus, there are three primary types of violent depictions: credible\r\rthreats, behavioral acts, and harmful consequences\" (Smith & Donnerstein, 1998, p. 170).\r\r\r3In the text to follow, all reported results are statistically significant (p < .05).\r\r\r4In this study, all effects are unweighted average effects.\r\r5These predictions are based on subsamples from which many of the most aggressive children had been\r\rdropped by the research team, reportedly because they were not accurately describing their television viewing.\r\r\r\rCopyright Notice\r\rBookshelf ID: NBK44293\r\r", "search_tags": ["watches many violent television shows and movies or plays a lot of violent games", "has few friends and is often rejected by other children because of his or her behavior", "makes friends with other children known to be unruly or aggressive", "consistently does not listen to adults", "not sensitive to the feelings of others", "cruel or violent toward pets or other animals"]}, "VERBAL BULLYING Media.txt": {"violence_tags": ["weapons use", "making threats", "intimidation"], "document_text": "\rTo the media, the cause and effect of school violence is a self-explanatory negative that we should all aim to avoid. However, the fact of the matter is things are never that simple. There is much more to school violence than initially meets the eye. There isn't one factor that causes school violence (not music, bullying, or anything else), and there is not a clear effect that results from violence. Keep reading for more information on this controversial and emotional issue.\r\t\r\r\rWhat Defines School Violence\rWe've all seen school violence on television news broadcasts; large tragedies like Columbine are quite difficult to forget. However, while that is one end of the spectrum of school violence, there is a whole other end to it. In fact, school violence can encompass bullying and seemingly insignificant behaviors that add up to teens feeling unsafe at school. School violence is a dangerous issue because it can be quite difficult to highlight exactly what causes it.\rIdeas on the Cause and Effect of School Violence\rMany experts, parents, and critics have tried to explain the cause and effect of school violence. Many have tried to blame violent video games that children play, music with suggestive and sensitive lyrics, and movies desensitizing children to violence. However, many critics of this perspective suggest that it is not the games but the effect of having a parent that never talked about the content of these media sources that can affect teens.\rAnother popular theory on what causes school violence is intolerance. In a world with so many different perspectives coming together, like different races, different sexual orientations and different nationalities, it can be difficult to feel like you fit in. It can be harder to find your place if everyone around you makes fun of you for the qualities which make you different. The intolerance that many face may contribute to school violence. Critics of this idea highlight that every teen faces intolerance on some level and that teens who \"break\" must be experiencing something different.\rhttps://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=l&ai=CU4DPf8riV4LCBML9iQPIkLOwBYObnN1Gy-fJrt4Dv-EeEAEghPj1AWDJhriN9KTQGaAB9ZqzoQPIAQKoAwHIA8EEqgSkAU_QAsyRMmGdK7lQ0oZkpzTKTD1W564kOD-uqw4IQzAEofrHRkwMefLjK5wk6IJ77A4W8JAELl29_glr7Aa4QiROUrzz-58hIkq99TOtBwqyBqBa2orFOm-JdMHPzYTYj7O_4B4X-pieOn9ISTqmfKn2SefzaP2MwyFvkfbThEtNI_qpdPUbhLSq9Dc_RxR5FpCk56zM-Oi9fXKj1T33osctFZfDoAYCgAfz5MxeqAeBxhuoB6a-G9gHAdIIBQiAYRAB&num=1&sig=AOD64_37FPblROt5t3eABs55QPCAdLUW2w&client=ca-pub-3619764495662405&adurl=http://wellnessme.net/%3Fad\r\r\rAnother theory is that since the early 1990s, access to weapons and illicit substances has increased. As a result, teens try to emulate many of the more violent experiences they hear about in the media. This is also related to increased access to things like drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes. Today's teens are exposed to these experiences in an entirely different way versus previous generations. Critics of this perspective highlight how prior generations did not have the same taboo of topics like smoking and would often become involved in these behaviors at an early age. To these critics, little has changed over the years.\rEffects of School Violence\rWhile it is easy to speculate about what the primary causes of school violence are, the effects of school violence are rather simple to see. One of the most damaging effects is the frequency of school shootings across America. Unfortunately, another visible effect is the loss of lives as a result of school violence.\rAnother effect of school violence is the shift that it brings to the educational process. Teachers are forced to be on the lookout for troubled students, rather than focusing on teaching alone. This heightened attention to school safety is unfortunately necessary, but it indicates a shifting perspective in American viewpoints of school. In some schools, teens may not be able to get as much of an education because educators need to be focused on keeping teens safe.\rAnother obvious effect of school violence is that many students end up feeling fearful of other students or of going to school. When dealing with school bullies, teens teasing one another, and past violent incidents, teens begin to fear what will happen to them everyday. Some parents react swiftly to these type of fears and look into homeschooling their own children.\rPrevention Is Key\rNo one will ever know the exact reason as to what causes more extreme cases of school violence. However, no matter the expert, one thing everyone can agree on is that violence in schools need to stop. Rather than focusing on what is behind violence in schools or what can happen as a result of it, we need to become focused on preventing school violence.\r", "search_tags": ["consistently does not listen to adults", "not sensitive to the feelings of others", "using drugs"]}, "doc2.txt": {"violence_tags": ["stealing", "weapons use", "making threats"], "document_text": "\r\rThe CDC leads many activities that help us to understand and e ectively prevent school violence.

For millions of youths and their families, a period of life that should have been distinguished by good health and great promise was instead marred by injuries, disability, and death (Cook & Laub, 1998). This epidemic of violence not only left lasting scars on victims, perpetrators, and their families and friends, it also wounded communities and, in ways not yet fully understood, the country as a whole.\rSince 1993, the peak year of the epidemic, there have been some encouraging signs that youth violence is declining. Three important indicators of violent behavior -- arrest records, victimization data, and hospital emergency room records -- have shown significant downward trends nationally. These official records reveal only a small part of the picture, however.\rA fourth key indicator of violence -- confidential reports by youths themselves -- reveals that the proportion of young people who acknowledge having committed serious, potentially lethal acts of physical violence has remained level since the peak of the epidemic. In 1999, for instance, there were 104,000 arrests of persons under age 18 for robbery, forcible rape, aggravated assault, or homicide (Snyder, 2000); of those arrests, 1,400 were for homicides perpetrated by adolescents (Snyder, 2000) and, occasionally, even younger children (Snyder & Sickmund, 1999). Yet in any given year in the late 1990s, at least 10 times as many youths reported that they had engaged in some form of violent behavior that could have seriously injured or killed another person.\rThe high prevalence of violent behavior reported by adolescents underscores the importance of this report at this time.\rAmericans cannot afford to become complacent. Even though youth violence is less lethal today than it was in 1993, the percentage of adolescents involved in violent behavior remains alarmingly high. The epidemic of lethal violence that swept the United States was fueled in large part by easy access to weapons, notably firearms -- and youths' self-reports of violence indicate that the potential for a resurgence of lethal violence exists. Yet viewing homicide as a barometer of all youth violence can be quite misleading. Similarly, judging the success of violence prevention efforts solely on the basis of reductions in homicides can be unwise.\rThis report, the first Surgeon General's report on youth violence in the United States, summarizes an extensive body of research and seeks to clarify seemingly contradictory trends, such as the discrepancies noted above between official records of youth violence and young people's self-reports of violent behaviors. It describes research identifying and clarifying the factors that increase the risk, or statistical probability, that a young person will become violent, as well as studies that have begun to identify developmental pathways that may lead a young person into a violent lifestyle. The report also explores the less well developed research area of factors that seem to protect youths from viewing violence as an acceptable -- or inevitable -- way of approaching or responding to life events. Finally, the report reviews research on the effectiveness of specific strategies and programs designed to reduce and prevent youth violence.\rAs these topics suggest, the key to preventing a great deal of violence is understanding where and when it occurs, determining what causes it, and scientifically documenting which of many strategies for prevention and intervention are truly effective. This state-of-the-science report summarizes progress toward those goals.\rThe most important conclusion of the report is that the United States is well past the \"nothing works\" era with respect to reducing and preventing youth violence. Less than 10 years ago, many observers projected an inexorably rising tide of violence; the recent, marked reductions in arrests of young perpetrators and in victimization reports appear to belie those dire predictions. We possess the knowledge and tools needed to reduce or even prevent much of the most serious youth violence. Scientists from many disciplines, working in a variety of settings with public and private agencies, are generating needed information and putting it to use in designing, testing, and evaluating intervention programs.\rThe most urgent need now is a national resolve to confront the problem of youth violence systematically, using research-based approaches, and to correct damaging myths and stereotypes that interfere with the task at hand. This report is designed to help meet that need.\rThe report makes it clear that after years of effort and massive expenditures of public and private resources, the search for solutions to the problem of youth violence remains an enormous challenge (Lipton et al., 1975; Sechrest et al., 1979). Some traditional as well as seemingly innovative approaches to reducing and preventing youth violence have failed to deliver on their promise, and successful approaches are often eclipsed by random violent events such as the recent school shootings that have occurred in communities throughout the country.\rYouth violence is a high-visibility, high-priority concern in every sector of U.S. society. We have come to understand that young people in every community are involved in violence, whether the community is a small town or central city, a neatly groomed suburb, or an isolated rural region. Although male adolescents, particularly those from minority groups, are disproportionately arrested for violent crimes, self-reports indicate that differences between minority and majority populations and between male and female adolescents may not be as large as arrest records indicate or conventional wisdom holds. Race/ethnicity, considered in isolation from other life circumstances, sheds little light on a given child's or adolescent's propensity for engaging in violence.\rThis chapter describes the scope and focus of the report and explains how the public health approach advances efforts to understand and prevent youth violence. Common myths about youth violence are presented and debunked. Uncorrected, these myths lead to misguided public policies, inefficient use of public and private resources, and loss of traction in efforts to address the problem. Documentation for the facts that counter these myths appears in later chapters. This chapter also lays out the scientific basis of the report -- that is, the standards of evidence that research studies had to meet in order to be included in the report and the sources of data cited throughout. Final sections of this chapter preview subsequent chapters and list the report's major conclusions.\rGo to:\rScope, Focus, and Overarching Themes\rThe mission of the Surgeon General is to protect and improve the public health of the Nation, and this report was developed within the responsibilities and spirit of that mission. The designation of youth violence as a public health concern is a recent development. As discussed below in greater detail, public health offers an approach to youth violence that focuses on prevention rather than consequences. It provides a framework for research and intervention that draws on the insights and strategies of diverse disciplines. Tapping into a rich but often fragmented knowledge base about risk factors, preventive interventions, and public education, the public health perspective calls for examining and reconciling what are frequently contradictory conclusions about youth violence.\rAlthough the public health approach opens up a broad array of considerations, the focus of this initial report is the perpetration by juveniles of interpersonal physical assault that carries a significant risk of injury or death. As restrictive as it may at first appear, this focus draws on a wealth of research into individual, family, school, peer group, and community factors that are associated with serious violence in the second decade of life. This report defines serious violence as aggravated assault, robbery, rape, and homicide; hereafter, it refers simply to \"violence\" or \"violent crime,\" thus avoiding repetitious use of the terms \"serious violence\" or \"serious violent crime.\"\rThe report views violence from a developmental perspective. It examines the interactions of youths' personal characteristics and the social contexts in which they live -- as well as the timing of those interactions -- to understand why some young people become involved in violence and some do not. This perspective considers a range of risks over the life course, from prenatal factors to factors influencing whether patterns of violent behavior in adolescence will persist into adulthood. The developmental perspective has enabled scientists to identify two general onset trajectories of violence: one in which violent behaviors emerge before puberty, and one in which they appear after puberty. Of the two, the early-onset trajectory provides stronger evidence of a link between early childhood experiences and persistent, even lifelong involvement in violent behavior. The developmental perspective is important because it enables us to time interventions for the particular point or stage of life when they will have the greatest positive effect.\rThe young people on whom this report focuses are principally children and adolescents from about age 10 through high school. Research reviewed in Chapter 4 shows that although risk factors for violence vary by stage of development, most youth violence emerges during the second decade of life. Appropriate interventions before and -- as is increasingly well documented -- during this period have a good chance of redirecting violent young people toward healthy and constructive adult lives. The window of opportunity for effective interventions opens early and rarely, if ever, closes.\rGo to:\rSecondary Areas of Concern\rMany legitimate concerns and issues that are indisputably associated with violence by young people are not addressed in depth in this first report. Behavioral patterns marked by aggressiveness, antisocial behavior, verbal abuse, and externalizing (the acting out of feelings) are peripheral to the main focus of the report. These behaviors may include violent physical interactions, such as hitting, slapping, and fist-fighting, that can have significant consequences but generally present little likelihood of serious injury or death. Therefore, such behaviors will be discussed only to the extent that they can be considered risk factors for violence.\rResearch has shown that victims and offenders share many personal characteristics and that victimization and perpetration of violent behavior are often entwined. Nonetheless, this report does not focus on victims of violence perpetrated by young offenders. Rather, it blends offender-based research with traditional public health concepts of prevention and intervention in an effort to bridge the gap between criminology and the social and developmental sciences, on the one hand, and traditional public health approaches to youth violence, on the other.\rThe report does not address violence against intimate partners, except when such violence is committed by a young person. The plight of victims, many of whom are children and adolescents, is of the utmost importance, but a key element in helping victims of violence is understanding the perpetrators of violence. Particular categories of crime, such as dating violence and hate crimes (motivated by racist or homophobic attitudes, for example), are important manifestations of violence, including violence committed by youths, and they demand research and targeted interventions. The limited amount of research conducted in this area has focused on victims, so there is little scientific evidence about what distinguishes perpetrators of these specific types of crimes (see reviews by Bergman, 1992; Comstock, 1991; and D'Augelli & Dark, 1984).\rSelf-directed violence -- that is, self-inflicted injury and suicide -- is not covered either. In collaboration with other Federal health agencies, the Office of the Surgeon General developed a National Strategy for the Prevention of Suicide (U.S. Public Health Service, 1999). In directing national attention to suicide as a major, yet largely preventable public health problem, the Surgeon General is bringing together health professional organizations, educators, health care executives, and managed care clinical directors to discuss gaps in scientific knowledge that impede efforts to decrease the incidence of suicide among Americans of all ages. The vast majority of youth suicides occur in the context of mental disorders (Brent et al., 1988; Shaffer et al., 1996), a topic that was reviewed in depth in the Surgeon General's report on mental health (U.S. DHHS, 1999).\rFinally, the report does not propose public policy to reduce or prevent youth violence. The purpose of this report, like others from U.S. Surgeons General, is to review and describe existing knowledge in order to provide a basis for action at all levels of society. The last chapter identifies potential courses of action, including specific areas in which research is needed, but suggesting whether and how such action will lend itself to policy development is beyond the purview of this report.\rGo to:\rYouth Violence: the Public Health Approach\rIn October 1985, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop convened an unprecedented Workshop on Violence and Public Health (U.S. DHHS, 1986). The participants agreed strongly that it was time public health perspectives and expertise were brought to bear on questions of crime and violence. Throughout much of the last century, these questions had been dominated by the social sciences and the criminal justice system. For the most part, health care efforts were restricted to the rehabilitation of convicted offenders (Sechrest et al., 1979; U.S. DHHS, 1986). Dissatisfaction with both the timing and the outcomes of the \"rehabilitation ideal\" spurred the search for a more effective role for health care in addressing violence.\rWith its emphasis on prevention of disease or injury, the public health approach to violence offers an appealing alternative to an exclusive focus on rehabilitation. Primary prevention identifies behavioral, environmental, and biological risk factors associated with violence and takes steps to educate individuals and communities and protect them from these risks. Central to education and protection is the principle that health promotion is best learned, performed, and maintained when it is ingrained in individuals' and communities' daily routines and perceptions of what constitutes good health practices.\rPublic health practitioners and advocates have taken the lead in encouraging alliances and networks among academic disciplines, professions, organizations, and communities to make health concerns permanent public priorities and part of personal practices. In that tradition, participants at the 1985 Surgeon General's conference emphasized the importance of convincing the public that violence should be treated as a public health problem. As Marvin Wolfgang, a distinguished leader in the field of criminology, told conferees, \"Our nation must feel as comfortable in controlling its violent behavioral urges and practices as it does in controlling bacterial, viral, and physical manifestations of morbidity and death\" (U.S. DHHS, 1986).\rJust as the application of public health principles and strategies has reduced the number of traffic fatalities and deaths attributed to tobacco use (CDC, 1999), the public health approach can help reduce the number of injuries and deaths caused by violence. Broader than the medical model, which is concerned with the diagnosis, treatment, and mechanisms of specific illnesses in individual patients, public health offers a practical, goal-oriented, and community-based approach to promoting and maintaining health. To identify problems and develop solutions for entire population groups, the public health approach:\r Defines the problem, using surveillance processes designed to gather data that establish the nature of the problem and the trends in its incidence and prevalence;\r Identifies potential causes through epidemiological analyses that identify risk and protective factors associated with the problem;\r Designs, develops, and evaluates the effectiveness and generalizability of interventions; and\r Disseminates successful models as part of a coordinated effort to educate and reach out to the public (Hamburg, 1998; Mercy et al., 1993).\r\rThe chapters in this report are keyed to each of these components of the public health approach. Chapter 2 presents research describing the magnitude of the problem of violent behavior by young people. Chapter 3 explores how violence develops and emerges over time. Chapter 4 summarizes research on risk and protective factors for youth violence; Appendix 4-B elaborates on the effects of exposure to media violence (including violence in interactive media) as a risk factor for aggressive and violent behavior. Chapter 5 focuses on the design, evaluation, and refinement of numerous programs and strategies that seek to reduce or prevent youth violence; Appendix 5-B provides details on specific programs discussed in the chapter. Chapter 6 suggests future courses of action, including the necessary next steps in research. A glossary of technical and discipline-specific terms follows.\rGo to:\rMyths About Youth Violence\rAn important reason for making research findings widely available is to challenge false notions and misconceptions about youth violence. Myths such as those listed below are intrinsically dangerous. Assumptions that a problem does not exist or failure to recognize the true nature of a problem can obscure the need for informed policy or for interventions. An example is the conventional wisdom in many circles that the epidemic of youth violence so evident in the early 1990s is over. Alternatively, myths may trigger public fears and lead to inappropriate or misguided policies that result in inefficient use of scarce public resources. An example is the current policy of waiving or transferring young offenders into adult criminal courts and prisons.\rMyth: The epidemic of violent behavior that marked the early 1990s is over, and young people -- as well as the rest of U.S. society -- are much safer today.\rFact: Although such key indicators of violence as arrest and victimization data clearly show significant reductions in violence since the peak of the epidemic in 1993, an equally important indicator warns against concluding that the problem is solved. Self-reports by youths reveal that involvement in some violent behaviors remains at 1993 levels (see Chapter 2).\rMyth: Most future offenders can be identified in early childhood.\rFact: Exhibiting uncontrolled behavior or being diagnosed with conduct disorder as a young child does not predetermine violence in adolescence. A majority of young people who become violent during their adolescent years were not highly aggressive or \"out of control\" in early childhood, and the majority of children with mental and behavioral disorders do not become violent in adolescence (see Chapter 3).\rMyth: Child abuse and neglect inevitably lead to violent behavior later in life.\rFact: Physical abuse and neglect are relatively weak predictors of violence, and sexual abuse does not predict violence. Most children who are abused or neglected will not become violent offenders during adolescence (see Chapter 4).\rMyth: African American and Hispanic youths are more likely to become involved in violence than other racial or ethnic groups.\rFact: Data from confidential interviews with youths indicate that race and ethnicity have little bearing on the overall proportion of racial and ethnic groups that engage in nonfatal violent behavior. However, there are racial and ethnic differences in homicide rates. There are also differences in the timing and continuity of violence over the life course, which account in part for the overrepresentation of these groups in U.S. jails and prisons (see Chapter 2).\rMyth: A new violent breed of young superpredators threatens the United States.\rFact: There is no evidence that young people involved in violence during the peak years of the early 1990s were more frequent or more vicious offenders than youths in earlier years. The increased lethality resulted from gun use, which has since decreased dramatically. There is no scientific evidence to document the claim of increased seriousness or callousness (see Chapter 3).\rMyth: Getting tough with juvenile offenders by trying them in adult criminal courts reduces the likelihood that they will commit more crimes.\rFact: Youths transferred to adult criminal court have significantly higher rates of reoffending and a greater likelihood of committing subsequent felonies than youths who remain in the juvenile justice system. They are also more likely to be victimized, physically and sexually (see Chapter 5).\rMyth: Nothing works with respect to treating or preventing violent behavior.\rFact: A number of prevention and intervention programs that meet very high scientific standards of effectiveness have been identified (see Chapter 5).\rMyth: In the 1990s, school violence affected mostly white students or students who attended suburban or rural schools.\rFact: African American and Hispanic males attending large inner-city schools that serve very poor neighborhoods faced -- and still face -- the greatest risk of becoming victims or perpetrators of a violent act at school. This is true despite recent shootings in suburban, middle-class, predominantly white schools (see Chapter 2).\rMyth: Weapons-related injuries in schools have increased dramatically in the last 5 years.\rFact: Weapons-related injuries have not changed significantly in the past 20 years. Compared to neighborhoods and homes, schools are relatively safe places for young people (see Chapter 2).\rMyth: Most violent youths will end up being arrested for a violent crime.\rFact: Most youths involved in violent behavior will never be arrested for a violent crime (see Chapter 2).\rGo to:\rSources of Data and Standards of Evidence\rData Sources\rSeveral comprehensive scholarly reviews of various facets of youth violence were published in the 1990s. Professional organizations, Federal agencies, the National Academy of Sciences, and university-based researchers have invested immense energy in reviewing research on the occurrence and patterns of youth violence, its causes and consequences, intervention strategies, and implications for society.\rKey contributions to this rich information base include:\r NIMH Taking Stock of Risk Factors for Child/Youth Externalizing Behavior Problems (Hann & Borek, in press)\r Serious and Violent Juvenile Offenders (Loeber & Farrington, 1998).

The authors gratefully acknowledge the contributors to and publishers of these earlier studies. Whenever the report draws heavily on one of these master sources, that fact is noted. Specific references to these documents are provided where appropriate.\rContributors to and editors of this report have also consulted peer-reviewed journals, books, and government reports and statistical compilations. Some information not considered in prior reviews is contained in this report. When appropriate, the editors have drawn on dissertations and forthcoming work that they judged to be of high quality.\rDuring the development of this report, special data analyses were obtained from established surveys of U.S. adolescents. The key data sources for these analyses are the following:\r Monitoring the Future survey conducted annually by the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research (Johnston et al., 1995)\r Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Study sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in collaboration with Federal, state, and local partners (Brener et al., 1999)\r The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control's Firearm Injury Surveillance Study (CDC, NCIPC, 2000)\r Several longitudinal databases generated by the Program of Research on the Causes and Correlates of Delinquency, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department of Justice (Huizinga et al., 1995)\r The National Center for Juvenile Justice's up-to-date information on juvenile arrests for violent crimes (Snyder, 2000)\r The National Crime Victimization Survey (Rand et al., 1998)\r\rStandards of Scientific Evidence for Multidisciplinary Research\rThe public health approach relies on a multidisciplinary, multijurisdictional knowledge base. Thus, in preparing this report, it was necessary to draw conclusions from research in psychology (social, developmental, clinical, and experimental), sociology, criminology, neuroscience, public health, epidemiology, communications, and education. Integrating findings and conclusions across disciplinary lines is never easy. The questions under study generally determine what approach scientists will take to designing and conducting research, and the approach often determines how investigators report their findings and conclusions. Even when scientific approaches are similar, investigators in different disciplines frequently employ different terminology to describe similar concepts.\rIn striving to apply scientific standards consistently across the many fields of research reviewed, this report has emphasized two criteria: appropriately rigorous methods of inquiry and sufficient data to support major conclusions. The need for rigor is obvious: The tools or strategies employed in research -- like the conclusions reached -- are only as good as the precision with which research questions are framed. But the quality of a given study depends on other factors as well, including:\r General data collection design. Data may be obtained through four major types of study design: experimental, longitudinal, cross-sectional, and case study. This report relies primarily on experimental and longitudinal designs, with some use of cross-sectional studies. (These three methods are described below.)\r Sampling, or the selection of persons to be studied. Individuals in a study may be recruited or identified through probability or nonprobability sampling, or they may be assigned to experimental or control groups by a random process, a precision or group-matching process, or some other means. This report refers to probability samples as representative samples.\r Validity and reliability of measures or instruments used in the research.\r Appropriateness and level of control incorporated into the analysis of findings. Level of control refers to efforts to take into account other factors that might be influencing data or responses from subjects.\r Appropriateness and significance of generalizations.\r\rAs noted earlier, four of the chapters in this report -- those concerned with magnitude, demographics, risk and protective factors, and intervention research and evaluation -- mirror components of the public health approach to youth violence. Each of these areas involves research from different disciplines and scientific approaches; therefore, the types of research designs and forms of analysis presented differ somewhat from chapter to chapter.\rExperimental research is the preferred method for assessing cause and effect as well as for determining how effectively an intervention works. Many of the violence prevention programs reviewed in Chapter 5 meet the standard of rigorous experimental (or well-executed quasi-experimental) designs. In an experimental study, researchers randomly assign an intervention to one group of study participants, the experimental group, and provide standard care or no intervention to another group, the control group. A study with a randomly assigned control group enables researchers to conclude that observed changes in the experimental group would not have happened without the intervention and did not occur by chance. The difference in outcome between the experimental and control groups, which in this case may be the reduction or elimination of violent behaviors, can then be attributed to the intervention.\rIdeally, researchers assign study participants to the experimental intervention or the control group at random. Randomization eliminates bias in the assignment process and provides a way of determining the likelihood that the effects observed occurred by chance. In this report, most weight is given to true experimental studies. In some cases, true experiments may be too difficult or expensive to conduct, or they may pose unacceptable ethical problems. In such cases, carefully designed and executed quasi-experimental studies are accepted as meeting the standard.\rEvidence from an experimental study is considered stronger when, in addition to analyzing the main effects of an intervention, researchers analyze the mediating effects. This analysis permits researchers to determine whether a change in the targeted risk or protective factor accounts for the observed change in violence -- that is, did the intervention work because it changed the degree of risk? Without this information, researchers cannot explain the success of a program.\rChapters 4 and 5 make use of meta-analyses. Meta-analysis describes a statistical method for evaluating the conclusions of numerous studies to determine the average size and consistency of the effect of a particular treatment or intervention strategy common to all of the studies. The technique makes the results of different studies comparable so that an overall effect can be identified. A meta-analysis determines whether there is consistent evidence that a treatment has a statistically significant effect, and it estimates the average size of that effect.\rEpidemiological research, reviewed in Chapters 2 and 3, focuses primarily on general population studies that use probability samples and cross-sectional or longitudinal designs (Kleinbaum et al., 1982; Lilienfeld & Lilienfeld, 1980; Rothman & Greenland, 1998). Probability samples let researchers generalize from their study to the entire population sampled. Cross-sectional studies involve a single contact with participants for data collection at a given point in time. Multiple cross-sectional studies involve several waves of data collection over time (annually, for example) but typically with different participants at each contact and therefore with no way to link a given person's responses at one time with those at a later time. Prospective longitudinal and panel designs involve multiple contacts with the same study participants over time. Responses at one data collection point can be linked to responses at a later point. Longitudinal studies are used for research on individual development or growth.\rLongitudinal designs are necessary to estimate the predictive effect of a given risk or protective factor on later violent behavior. Although cross-sectional designs are sometimes used, they cannot provide estimates of individual-level predictive effects. They can establish simultaneous relationships between risk factors and violence, but conclusions drawn from cross-sectional studies are not as strong as those drawn from longitudinal studies. In cross-sectional studies, cause and effect are unclear and reciprocal effects may inflate the estimates.\rExperimental studies are sometimes used to estimate the effects of risk and protective factors, but this practice is rare because of ethical and cost considerations. For example, it would be unthinkable to introduce drug use to a group of adolescents to see whether drugs are a risk factor for violence. However, it would be ethical to conduct a predictive study that selects persons who are not violent and follows them over time. Those who began to use illicit substances would be compared with those who did not, to determine whether drug users are more likely to become involved in violent behaviors at some later date. If they were, then the results would indicate that drug use predicts violence or that drug use increases the probability of future violence.\rLevel of Evidence\rNo single study, however well designed, is sufficient to establish causation or, in intervention research, efficacy or effectiveness. Findings must be replicated before gaining widespread acceptance by the scientific community. The strength of the evidence amassed for any scientific fact or conclusion is referred to as the level of evidence.\rThis report does not rely on any single study for conclusions. Only findings that have been replicated in several studies, consistently and with no contrary results, are reported as part of the contemporary knowledge base. When the report cites unreplicated studies that are of high quality, that have not been refuted by other evidence, and that point in a clear direction, the findings are described as tentative or suggestive. These findings may point to future research needs and directions, but the report takes a conservative approach to drawing conclusions from them.\rGo to:\rOverview of the Report's Chapters\rThe Surgeon General's report on youth violence reviews a vast, multidisciplinary, and often controversial research literature. Chapters 2 through 5 address, respectively, the extent and magnitude of youth violence; the developmental characteristics of, or paths to, youth violence; personal and environmental factors that may either place a child or adolescent at risk of violent behavior or protect a young person from succumbing to those risk factors; and violence intervention and prevention programs. The final chapter in the report identifies areas of opportunity for future efforts to combat and prevent youth violence.\rThis section provides a brief overview of each chapter, while the following section presents a summary of key conclusions drawn from each.\rChapter 2 examines the magnitude of and trends in youth violence over the last two decades. It describes two different, but complementary ways of measuring violence -- official reports and self-reports. Official arrest data offer an obvious means of determining the extent of youth violence. Indeed, a surge in arrests for violent crimes marked what is now recognized as an epidemic of youth violence from 1983 to 1993. Arrests were driven largely by the rapid proliferation of firearms use by adolescents engaging in violent acts and the likelihood that violent confrontations would -- as they did -- produce serious or lethal injuries. Today, with fewer young people carrying weapons, including guns, to school and elsewhere than in the early 1990s, violent encounters are less likely to result in homicide and serious injury and therefore are less likely to draw the attention of police. By 1999, arrest rates for homicide, rape, and robbery had all dropped below 1983 rates. In contrast, arrest rates for aggravated assault remained higher than they were in 1983, having declined only 24 percent from the peak rates in 1994.\rAnother way of measuring violence is on the basis of confidential reporting by youths themselves. Confidential surveys find that 10 to 15 percent of high school seniors report having committed an act of serious violence in recent years. These acts typically do not come to the attention of police, in part because they are less likely to involve firearms than in previous years. Over the past two decades, self-reported violence by high school seniors increased nearly 50 percent, a trend similar to that found in arrests for violent crimes. But this proportion has not declined in the years since 1993 -- it remains at peak levels. Chapter 2 considers how and to what extent arrest data and self-report data vary, including variations by sex and race or ethnicity. In the aggregate, the best available evidence from multiple sources indicates that youth violence is an ongoing national problem, albeit one that is largely hidden from public view.\rChapter 3 examines routes that may lead a young person into violence. Viewed from a developmental perspective, violence stems from a complex interaction of individuals with their environment at particular times in their lives. Longitudinal research has enabled investigators to describe the emergence of violence in terms of two, and possibly more, life-course trajectories. Chapter 3 discusses the early-onset and late-onset emergence of violence, which occur before and after puberty, respectively. These trajectories offer insights into the likely course, severity, and duration of violence over the life course and have practical implications for the timing of intervention programs and strategies. The chapter reviews research on the co-occurrence of serious violence and other problems, including drug use and mental disorders. Finally, it underscores the importance -- and the paucity -- of research on factors associated with the cessation of youth violence or its continuation into adulthood.\rExtensive research in recent decades has sought to identify various personal characteristics and environmental conditions that either place children and adolescents at risk of violent behavior or that seem to protect them from the effects of risk. Risk and protective factors, which are the focus of Chapter 4, can be found in every area of life. They exert different effects at different stages of development, they tend to appear in clusters, and they appear to gain strength in numbers. As the chapter notes, risk probabilities apply to groups, not to individuals. Although risk factors are not necessarily causes, a central aim of the public health approach to youth violence is to identify these predictors and determine when in the life course they typically come into play. Such information enables researchers to design preventive programs that can be put in place at just the right time to be most effective.\rThe chapter examines risk from the perspectives of both childhood and adolescence and, within each of these developmental periods, considers risk factors occurring in the individual, family, school, peer group, and community domains. Childhood risk factors for violence in adolescence include involvement in serious (but not necessarily violent) criminal acts and substance use before puberty, being male, aggressiveness, low family socioeconomic status/poverty, and antisocial parents -- all either individual or family risk factors. The influence of family is largely supplanted in adolescence by peer influences, thus risk factors with the largest predictive effects in adolescence include weak social ties, ties to antisocial or delinquent peers, and belonging to a gang. Having committed serious (but not necessarily violent) criminal offenses is also an important risk factor in adolescence.\rIdentifying and understanding how protective factors influence behavior is potentially as important to preventing and stopping violence as identifying and understanding risk factors. Several protective factors have been proposed, but to date only two have been found to buffer the risk of violence -- an intolerant attitude toward deviance and commitment to school. Protective factors warrant, and are beginning to receive, more research attention.\rDespite past contentions that \"nothing works\" to prevent youth violence, the evidence presented in Chapter 5 demonstrates that prevention efforts can be effective against both early- and late-onset violence in the general youth population, high-risk youths, and even youths who are already violent or seriously delinquent. The chapter highlights 27 specific programs that, based on existing data, help prevent youth violence. The most effective of these programs combine components known to prevent violence by themselves, particularly social skills training for youths and interventions that include parents or entire families.\rChapter 5 also highlights important limitations in the current research on youth violence prevention. Little is known about the scientific effectiveness of hundreds of programs now being used in U.S. schools and communities. This situation is disconcerting, given that many well-intentioned youth violence prevention programs have been found ineffective or harmful to youths. Even less is known about how to implement effective programs on a national scale without compromising their results.\rThe information presented in Chapter 5 shows that youth violence prevention not only works, it can also be cost-effective. In a number of cases, the long-term financial benefits of prevention are substantially greater than the costs of the programs themselves. These promising findings indicate that prevention plays an important role in providing a safe environment for youths.\rFinally, Chapter 6 presents several options for future action. First, the scientific base must continue to be expanded. Effective interventions exist, but only continued research can document those programs that meet a standard of effectiveness and those that do not -- and should therefore be discarded. The chapter identifies the following courses of action:\r Continue to build the science base\r Accelerate the decline in gun use by youths in violent encounters\r Facilitate the entry of youths into effective intervention programs rather than incarcerating them\r Disseminate model programs with incentives that will ensure fidelity to original program design when taken to scale\r Provide training and certification programs for intervention personnel\r Improve public awareness of effective interventions\r Convene youths and families, researchers, and private and public organizations for a periodic youth violence summit\r Improve Federal, state, and local strategies for reporting crime information and violent deaths\r\rGo to:\rChapter Conclusions\rChapter 2\r1.\r\r\rThe decade between 1983 and 1993 was marked by an epidemic of increasingly lethal violence that was associated with a large rise in the use of firearms and involved primarily African American males. There was a modest rise in the proportion of young persons involved in other forms of serious violence.2.\r\r\r\rSince 1994, a decline in homicide arrests has reflected primarily the decline in use of firearms. There is some evidence that the smaller decline in nonfatal serious violence is also attributable to declining firearm use.3.\r\r\r\r\rBy 1999, arrest rates for violent crimes -- with the exception of aggravated assault -- had fallen below 1983 levels. Arrest rates for aggravated assault remain almost 70 percent higher than they were in 1983, and this is the offense most frequently captured in self-reports of violence.4.\r\r\r\r\r\rDespite the present decline in gun use and in lethal violence, the self-reported proportion of young people involved in nonfatal violence has not declined from the peak years of the epidemic, nor has the proportion of students injured with a weapon at school declined.5.\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThe proportion of schools in which gangs are present continued to increase after 1994 and has only recently (1999) declined. However, evidence shows that the number of youths involved with gangs has not declined and remains near the peak levels of 1996.6.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rAlthough arrest statistics cannot readily track firearm use in specific serious crimes other than homicide, firearm use in violent crimes declined among persons of all ages between 1993 and 1998.7.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThe steep rise and fall in arrest rates for homicide over the past two decades have been matched by similar, but less dramatic changes in some of the other indicators of violence, including arrest rates for all violent crimes and incident rates from victims' self-reports. This pattern is not matched by arrests for selected offenses, such as aggravated assault, or incident rates and prevalence rates from offenders' self-reports.8.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rYoung men -- particularly those from minority groups -- are disproportionately arrested for violent crimes. But self-reports indicate that differences between minority and majority populations and between young men and young women may not be as large as arrest records indicate or conventional wisdom holds. Race/ethnicity, considered in isolation from other life circumstances, sheds little light on a given child's or adolescent's propensity for engaging in violence.9.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rSchools nationwide are relatively safe. Compared to homes and neighborhoods, schools have fewer homicides and nonfatal injuries. Youths at greatest risk of being killed in school-associated violence are those from a racial or ethnic minority, senior high schools, and urban school districts.Chapter 3\r1.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThere are two general onset trajectories for youth violence -- an early one, in which violence begins before puberty, and a late one, in which violence begins in adolescence. Youths who become violent before about age 13 generally commit more crimes, and more serious crimes, for a longer time. These young people exhibit a pattern of escalating violence through childhood, and they sometimes continue their violence into adulthood.2.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rMost youth violence begins in adolescence and ends with the transition into adulthood.3.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rMost highly aggressive children or children with behavioral disorders do not become serious violent offenders.4.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rSurveys consistently find that about 30 to 40 percent of male youths and 15 to 30 percent of female youths report having committed a serious violent offense by age 17.5.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rSerious violence is part of a lifestyle that includes drugs, guns, precocious sex, and other risky behaviors. Youths involved in serious violence often commit many other types of crimes and exhibit other problem behaviors, presenting a serious challenge to intervention efforts. Successful interventions must confront not only the violent behavior of these young people, but also their lifestyles, which are teeming with risk.6.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThe differences in patterns of serious violence by age of onset and the relatively constant rates of individual offending have important implications for prevention and intervention programs. Early childhood programs that target at-risk children and families are critical for preventing the onset of a chronic violent career, but programs must also be developed to combat late-onset violence.7.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThe importance of late-onset violence prevention is not widely recognized or well understood. Substantial numbers of serious violent offenders emerge without warning signs in their childhood. A comprehensive community prevention strategy must address both onset patterns and ferret out their causes and risk factors.Chapter 4\r1 Risk and protective factors exist in every area of life -- individual, family, school, peer group, and community. Individual characteristics interact in complex ways with people and conditions in the environment to produce violent behavior.\r2 Risk and protective factors vary in predictive power depending on when in the course of development they occur. As children move from infancy to early adulthood, some risk factors will become more important and others less important. Substance use, for example, is a much stronger risk factor at age 9 than it is at age 14.\r3 The strongest risk factors during childhood are involvement in serious, but not necessarily violent criminal behavior, substance use, being male, physical aggression, low family socioeconomic status or poverty and antisocial parents -- all individual or family characteristics or conditions.\r4 During adolescence, the influence of family is largely supplanted by peer influences. The strongest risk factors are weak ties to conventional peers, ties to antisocial or delinquent peers, belonging to a gang, and involvement in other criminal acts.\r5 Risk factors do not operate in isolation -- the more risk factors a child or young person is exposed to, the greater the likelihood that he or she will become violent. Risk factors can be buffered by protective factors, however. An adolescent with an intolerant attitude toward deviance, for example, is unlikely to seek or be sought out by delinquent peers, a strong risk factor for violence at that age.\r6 Given the strong evidence that risk factors predict the likelihood of future violence, they are useful for identifying vulnerable populations that may benefit from intervention efforts. Risk markers such as race or ethnicity are frequently confused with risk factors; risk markers have no causal relation to violence.\r7 No single risk factor or combination of factors can predict violence with unerring accuracy. Most young people exposed to a single risk factor will not become involved in violent behavior; similarly, many young people exposed to multiple risks will not become violent. By the same token, protective factors cannot guarantee that a child exposed to risk will not become violent.\rChapter 5\r1 A number of youth violence intervention and prevention programs have demonstrated that they are effective; assertions that \"nothing works\" are false.\r2 Most highly effective programs combine components that address both individual risks and environmental conditions, particularly building individual skills and competencies, parent effectiveness training, improving the social climate of the school, and changes in type and level of involvement in peer groups.\r3 Rigorous evaluation of programs is critical. While hundreds of prevention programs are being used in schools and communities throughout the country, little is known about the effects of most of them.\r4 At the time this report was prepared, nearly half of the most thoroughly evaluated strategies for preventing violence had been shown to be ineffective -- and a few were known to harm participants.\r5 In schools, interventions that target change in the social context appear to be more effective, on average, than those that attempt to change individual attitudes, skills, and risk behaviors.\r6 Involvement with delinquent peers and gang membership are two of the most powerful predictors of violence, yet few effective interventions have been developed to address these problems.\r7 Program effectiveness depends as much on the quality of implementation as the type of intervention. Many programs are ineffective not because their strategy is misguided, but because the quality of implementation is poor.\rGo to:\rPreparation of the Report\rTo address the troubling presence of violence in the lives of U.S. youths, the Administration and Congress urged the Surgeon General to develop a report on youth violence, with particular focus on the scope of the problem, its causes, and how to prevent it. Surgeon General Dr. David Satcher requested three agencies, all components of the Department of Health and Human Services, to share lead responsibility for preparing the report. The agencies are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).\rUnder Dr. Satcher's guidance, these agencies established a Planning Board comprising individuals with expertise in diverse disciplines and professions involved in the study, treatment, and prevention of youth violence. The Planning Board also enlisted individuals representing various Federal departments, including particularly the Department of Justice (juvenile crime aspects of youth violence), the Department of Education (school safety issues), and the Department of Labor (the association between youth violence and youth employment, and out-of-school youth). Invaluable assistance was obtained as well from individual citizens who have founded and operate nonprofit organizations designed to meet the needs of troubled and violent youths. Most important, young people themselves accepted invitations to become involved in the effort. All of these persons helped to plan the report and participated in its prepublication reviews.\rGo to:\rReferences\r1 Violence and youth: Psychology's response.
