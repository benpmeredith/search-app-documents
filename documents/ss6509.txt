Abstract
Problem: Sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts can both be used to identify sexual minority youth. Significant health disparities
exist between sexual minority and nonsexual minority youth. However, not enough is known about health-related behaviors that
contribute to negative health outcomes among sexual minority youth and how the prevalence of these health-related behaviors
compare with the prevalence of health-related behaviors among nonsexual minorities.
Reporting Period: September 2014–December 2015.
Description of the System: The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority healthrelated behaviors among youth and young adults: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco
use; 3) alcohol and other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections,
including human immunodeficiency virus infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. In addition, YRBSS
monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma and other priority health-related behaviors. YRBSS includes a national schoolbased Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted by CDC and state and large urban school district school-based YRBSs
conducted by state and local education and health agencies. For the 2015 YRBSS cycle, a question to ascertain sexual identity
and a question to ascertain sex of sexual contacts was added for the first time to the national YRBS questionnaire and to the
standard YRBS questionnaire used by the states and large urban school districts as a starting point for their YRBS questionnaires.
This report summarizes results for 118 health-related behaviors plus obesity, overweight, and asthma by sexual identity and sex
of sexual contacts from the 2015 national survey, 25 state surveys, and 19 large urban school district surveys conducted among
students in grades 9–12.
Results: Across the 18 violence-related risk behaviors nationwide, the prevalence of 16 was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual
students than heterosexual students and the prevalence of 15 was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the
same sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex. Across the 13 tobacco use-related
risk behaviors, the prevalence of 11 was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than heterosexual students and the
prevalence of 10 was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes than students who
had sexual contact with only the opposite sex. Similarly, across the 19 alcohol or other drug use-related risk behaviors, the prevalence
of 18 was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than
heterosexual students and the prevalence of 17 was higher among

risk behaviors. The prevalence of five of these behaviors was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than heterosexual
students and the prevalence of four was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes
than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex. No clear pattern of differences emerged for birth control use,
dietary behaviors, and physical activity.
Interpretation: The majority of sexual minority students cope with the transition from childhood through adolescence to
adulthood successfully and become healthy and productive adults. However, this report documents that sexual minority students
have a higher prevalence of many health-risk behaviors compared with nonsexual minority students.
Public Health Action: To reduce the disparities in health-risk behaviors among sexual minority students, it is important to raise
awareness of the problem; facilitate access to education, health care, and evidence-based interventions designed to address priority
health-risk behaviors among sexual minority youth; and continue to implement YRBSS at the national, state, and large urban
school district levels to document and monitor the effect of broad policy and programmatic interventions on the health-related
behaviors of sexual minority youth.

Introduction
Sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts can both be used to
identify sexual minority youth. Sexual minority youth include
those who identify as gay, lesbian, and bisexual and those who
are not sure about their sexual identity as well as those who
have sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes.
Dissonance between sexual identity and sex of sexual contact
occurs, particularly among youth (1–7). Some youth who
identify as heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual and some
youth who are not sure of their sexual identity might not
have had any sexual contact. Some youth who have had sexual
contact with only the same sex or with both sexes might identify
as heterosexual and some youth who have had sexual contact
with only the opposite sex might identify as gay, lesbian, or
bisexual or be not sure of their sexual identity. Sexual identity
and sex of sexual contacts can change throughout the life span.
Significant health disparities exist between sexual minority
and nonsexual minority youth (7,8). More specifically,
violence, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection,
sexually transmitted infections, and pregnancy occur more
frequently among sexual minority youth than nonsexual
minority youth. In addition, some sexual minority youth
struggle with stigma, discrimination, family disapproval, and
social rejection. However, not enough is known about healthrelated behaviors that contribute to negative health outcomes
among sexual minority youth and how the prevalence of these
health-related behaviors compare with the prevalence of healthrelated behaviors among nonsexual minority youth (8).
CDC developed the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System
(YRBSS) to monitor six categories of priority health-related
behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of mortality
and morbidity among youth and adults in the United States:
1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and
violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and other drug use;
4) sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and

sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV infection;
5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. These
behaviors frequently are interrelated and are established during
childhood and adolescence and extend into adulthood. YRBSS
also monitors obesity, overweight, asthma, and other priority
health-related behaviors. YRBSS includes school-based national,
state, and large urban school district Youth Risk Behavior
Surveys (YRBS) conducted among representative samples of
students in grades 9–12. Additional information about the
YRBSS is available at http://www.cdc.gov/yrbs.
Since 1995, the need for data on the priority health-related
behaviors of high school students by sexual minority subgroup
has been recognized by an increasing number of states and large
urban school districts (Table 1). With CDC support, these
states and large urban school districts began adding at least one
of two questions to their YRBS questionnaire to ascertain sexual
identity and/or sex of sexual contacts and to generate estimates
of priority health-related behaviors by sexual identity and sex
of sexual contacts. For the 1997 YRBSS cycle, a question on
sexual identity and a question on sex of sexual contacts were
placed on the YRBS Optional Question List for the first time
indicating CDC’s support for the use of these questions. Results
from seven states and six large urban school districts that used
these questions during 2001–2009 were then summarized in
a previous MMWR Surveillance Summary (9). For the 2015
YRBSS cycle, on the basis of substantial support from the
state and large urban school district YRBS coordinators, the
two questions ascertaining sexual minority status were added
for the first time to the standard YRBS questionnaire used by
the states and large urban school districts as a starting point
for their YRBS questionnaires. The two questions also were
added to the national YRBS questionnaire for the first time.
This report provides the first national estimates of the
percentage of high school students who are gay, lesbian,
and bisexual or are not sure of their sexual identity and the
percentage of high school students who have had sexual contact

with only the same sex or with both sexes. In addition, this
report summarizes results for 118 health-related behaviors
plus obesity, overweight, and asthma from the 2015 national
YRBS by sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts. Results
from 25 state and 19 large urban school district surveys that
added at least one of the questions to ascertain sexual minority
status and had weighted data for the 2015 YRBSS cycle also
are included in this report. However, seven states (Colorado,
Georgia, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin) and
two large urban school districts (Chicago and Shelby County)
that added at least one of the questions to ascertain sexual
minority status, but had unweighted data, are not included
in this report. Among the 25 states and 19 large urban school
districts included in this report, two state and one large urban
school district surveys were conducted during fall 2014; the
national survey, 22 state, and 16 large urban school district
surveys were conducted during spring 2015; and one state
and two large urban school district surveys were conducted
during fall 2015.

Methods
Detailed information about the methodology of the
national, state, and large urban school district YRBSs has been
described elsewhere (10). Information also is available at http://
www.cdc.gov/yrbs.

Sampling
National Youth Risk Behavior Survey
The sampling frame for the 2015 national YRBS consisted
of all regular public* and private† schools with students in at
least one of grades 9–12 in the 50 states and the District of
Columbia. The sampling frame was based on the Market Data
Retrieval (MDR) database (11), which includes information
on both public and private schools, and the most recent
data from the Common Core of Data from the National
Center for Education Statistics (12). A three-stage cluster
sample design produced a nationally representative sample of
students in grades 9–12 who attend public and private schools.
The first-stage sampling frame consisted of 1,259 primary
sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties, subareas of
large counties, or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. The
1,259 PSUs were categorized into 16 strata according to their
metropolitan statistical area (MSA) status (e.g., urban city)
*	Might include charter schools and public alternative, special education, or
vocational schools.
†	Might include religious and other private schools, but does not include private
alternative, special education, or vocational schools.

and the percentages of black and Hispanic students in the
PSUs. From the 1,259 PSUs, 54 were sampled with probability
proportional to overall school enrollment size for the PSU.
In the second stage of sampling, 180 schools with any of
grades 9–12 were sampled with probability proportional to
school enrollment size from within the 54 PSUs. The third
stage of sampling consisted of random sampling in each of
grades 9–12, one or two classrooms from either a required
subject (e.g., English or social studies) or a required period (e.g.,
homeroom or second period). All students in sampled classes
were eligible to participate. Schools, classes, and students that
refused to participate were not replaced.

State and Large Urban School District Youth Risk
Behavior Surveys
In 2015, a two-stage cluster sample design was used to
produce a representative sample of public§ school students in
grades 9–12 in the 25 states and 19 large urban school districts
that asked at least one of two questions to ascertain sexual
minority status. In the first sampling stage, schools with any
of grades 9–12 were sampled with probability proportional to
school enrollment size in 23 states and three large urban school
districts; all schools with any of grades 9–12 were invited to
participate in two states and 16 large urban school districts. In
the second sampling stage, intact classes from either a required
subject (e.g., English or social studies) or a required period
(e.g., homeroom or second period) were sampled randomly in
24 states and 18 large urban school districts, and all students
in the sampled classes were eligible to participate. In one state
and one large urban school district, all students in sampled
schools were eligible to participate.

Data Collection Procedures and
Questionnaires
Survey procedures for the national, state, and large urban
school district surveys were designed to protect students’ privacy
by allowing for anonymous and voluntary participation. Before
survey administration, local parental permission procedures
were followed. Students completed the self-administered
questionnaire during one class period and recorded their
responses directly on a computer-scannable booklet or answer
sheet. CDC’s Institutional Review Board approved the protocol
for the national YRBS.
The 2015 standard YRBS questionnaire contained 89
questions. This questionnaire was used as the starting point
for the state and large urban school district questionnaires.

States and large urban school districts could add and/or delete
questions from the standard questionnaire. Only two states and
three large urban school districts used the 2015 YRBS standard
questionnaire without modifications. This report presents
state and large urban school district results only from selected
questions on the 2015 standard questionnaire.
The 2015 national YRBS questionnaire contained
99 questions including all 89 questions on the standard
questionnaire. This report presents national results (along
with state and large urban school district results) for selected
questions on the 2015 standard questionnaire, plus national
only results from eight additional questions measuring usual
method of marijuana use, ever use of hallucinogenic drugs,
consumption of sports drinks, consumption of water, muscle
strengthening exercises, indoor tanning device use, having had
a sunburn, and avoidance of foods because eating the food
could cause an allergic reaction.
Two questions on the standard questionnaire and national
questionnaire measured sexual minority status. Sexual identity
was ascertained with the following question: “Which of
the following best describes you?” Response options were
“heterosexual (straight),” “gay or lesbian,” “bisexual,” and “not
sure.” All 25 states and 19 large urban school districts included
this question. Sex of sexual contacts was ascertained with:
“During your life, with whom have you had sexual contact?”
Response options were “I have never had sexual contact,”
“females,” “males,” and “females and males.” No definition
was provided for sexual contact. All but two (Arizona and
North Dakota) of the 25 states and all 19 large urban school
districts included this question.
Except for six demographic questions (sex, grade in
school, age, Hispanic ethnicity, race, and sexual identity)
and three questions assessing height, weight, and asthma,
all the remaining questions on the standard questionnaire
and the national questionnaire measured behaviors practiced
or experienced by the students (referred to as “behaviors”).
Skip patterns, which occur when a particular response to one
question indicates to the respondents that they should not
answer one or more subsequent questions, were not included
in any YRBS questionnaire to protect students’ privacy by
ensuring all students took about the same amount of time
to complete the questionnaire. All questions (except for two
questions assessing height and weight and the race question)
were multiple choice with a maximum of eight mutually
exclusive response options and only one possible answer per
respondent. Information about the reliability of the standard
questionnaire has been published elsewhere (13). The wording
of each question, including recall periods, response options,
and operational definitions are available in the 2015 standard
and national YRBS questionnaires at http://www.cdc.gov/yrbs.

Data Processing Procedures and
Response Rates
For the 2015 national YRBS, 15,713 questionnaires were
completed in 125 public and private schools. The national data
set was cleaned and edited for inconsistencies. Missing data
were not statistically imputed. Among the 15,713 completed
questionnaires, 89 failed quality control¶ and were excluded
from analysis, resulting in 15,624 usable questionnaires
(Table 2). The school response rate was 69%, the students
response rate was 86%, and the overall response rate was 60%**.
Data from each state and large urban school district survey
were cleaned and edited for inconsistencies with the same
procedures used for the national data set. The percentage
of completed questionnaires that failed quality control
checks and were excluded from analysis ranged from 0.2%
to 5.3% (median: 0.8%) across the 25 states and from 0.3%
to 6.4% (median: 1.6%) across the 19 large urban school
districts. The student sample sizes ranged from 1,452 to
55,596 (median: 2,899) across the states and from 1,052 to
10,419 (median: 2,181) across the large urban school districts
(Table 2). Among the states, the school response rates ranged
from 70% to 100%, student response rates ranged from 66%
to 90%, and overall response rates ranged from 60% to 82%.
Among the large urban school districts, the school response
rates ranged from 90% to 100%, student response rates ranged
from 66% to 88%, and overall response rates ranged from
64% to 88%.
To obtain a sufficient sample size for analyses of healthrelated behaviors by sexual identity subgroups, students who
selected “gay or lesbian” or “bisexual” were combined into a
single subgroup and are referred to as “gay, lesbian, and bisexual
students” as appropriate. Students who selected “heterosexual
(straight)” are referred to as “heterosexual students” and
students who selected “not sure” are referred to as “not sure
students.” Sex of sexual contact was computed from “During
your life, with whom have you had sexual contact?” and “What
is your sex?” (response options were “female” and “male”). To
obtain a sufficient sample size for analyses of health-related
behaviors by sex of sexual contact subgroups, students who had
sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes were
combined into a single subgroup and are referred to as “students
who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both
sexes.” Students who had sexual contact with only the opposite
sex are referred to as “students who had sexual contact with
only the opposite sex.” Students who selected “I have never had

sexual contact” are referred to as “students who had no sexual
contact.” Students who had no sexual contact were excluded
from analyses on sexual behaviors, female students who had
sexual contact with only females were excluded from analyses
on condom use and birth control use, and male students who
had sexual contact with only males were excluded from analyses
on birth control use.
Race/ethnicity was computed from two questions: 1) “Are
you Hispanic or Latino?” (response options were “yes”
and “no”), and 2) “What is your race?” (response options
were “American Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian,” “black
or African American,” “Native Hawaiian or other Pacific
Islander,” and “white”). For the second question, students
could select more than one response option. For this report,
students were classified as “Hispanic/ Latino” and are referred
to as “Hispanic” if they answered “yes” to the first question,
regardless of how they answered the second question. Students
who answered “no” to the first question and selected only
“black or African American” to the second question were
classified as “black or African American” and are referred to as
“black.” Students who answered “no” to the first question and
selected only “white” to the second question were classified,
and are referred to, as “white.” Race/ethnicity was classified
as missing for students who did not answer the first question
and for students who answered “no” to the first question but
did not answer the second question.
Students were classified as having obesity or being overweight
based on their body mass index (kg/m2) (BMI), which was
calculated from self-reported height and weight. The BMI
values were compared with sex- and age-specific reference data
from the 2000 CDC growth charts (14). Obesity was defined
as a BMI of ≥95th percentile for age and sex. Overweight was
defined as a BMI of ≥85th percentile and <95th percentile for
age and sex. These classifications are not intended to diagnose
obesity or overweight in individual students, but to provide
population-level estimates of obesity and overweight.

Weighting
For the national YRBS, a weight based on student sex, race/
ethnicity, and grade was applied to each record to adjust for
school and student nonresponse and oversampling of black and
Hispanic students. The overall weights were scaled so that the
weighted count of students equals the total sample size, and
the weighted proportions of students in each grade match the
national population proportions. Therefore, weighted estimates
are representative of all students in grades 9–12 attending
public and private schools in the United States.
Data from states and large urban school districts that had a
representative sample of students, appropriate documentation,

and an overall response rate of ≥60% were weighted. A weight
was applied to each record to adjust for school and student
nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade, sex,
and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction, such that the weighted
count of students equals the student population in each
jurisdiction. Data from 25 states and 19 large urban school
districts were weighted. The weighted prevalence estimates are
representative of all students in grades 9–12 attending public
schools in each jurisdiction.

Analytic Methods
Statistical analyses were conducted on weighted data using
SAS (15) and SUDAAN (16) software to account for the
complex sampling designs. Prevalence estimates and confidence
intervals were computed for all variables and all data sets. In
addition, for the national YRBS data, t tests (17) were used to
determine pairwise differences between sexual identity and sex
of sexual contact subgroups. Differences between prevalence
estimates were considered statistically significant if the t test
p value was <0.05 for main effects (sexual identity and sex of
sexual contacts) and for interactions (sex by sexual identity,
sexual identity by sex, sex by sex of sexual contacts, and sex of
sexual contacts by sex). In the results section, only statistically
significant differences in national YRBS prevalence estimates
are reported in the following order: sexual identity, sex by
sexual identity, sexual identity by sex, sex of sexual contacts,
sex by sex of sexual contacts, and sex of sexual contacts by sex.

Results
Nationwide, 88.8% of students identified as heterosexual,
2.0% identified as gay or lesbian, 6.0% identified as bisexual,
and 3.2% were not sure of their sexual identity (Table 3).
Across 25 states, from 84.4% to 91.1% (median: 87.4%)
of students identified as heterosexual, from 0.8% to 4.4%
(median: 2.7%) identified as gay or lesbian, from 4.8% to
8.1% (median 6.4%) identified as bisexual, and from 2.8%

Across 19 large urban school districts, from 77.6% to 89.7%
(median: 86.0%) of students identified as heterosexual, from
1.4% to 7.6% (median: 3.1%) identified as gay or lesbian,
from 4.3% to 10.8% (median: 6.5%) identified as bisexual,
and from 3.2% to 5.8% (median: 4.5%) were not sure of their
sexual identity.
Nationwide, 48.0% of students had had sexual contact with
only the opposite sex, 1.7% had had sexual contact with only
the same sex, 4.6% had had sexual contact with both sexes,
and 45.7% had had no sexual contact (Table 4). Across 23
states, from 36.8% to 51.5% (median: 45.7%) of students

same sex or with both sexes (13.0%) than students who had no
sexual contact (2.8%). Among female students, the prevalence
was higher among those who had sexual contact with only males
(18.2%) than those who had sexual contact with only females or
with both sexes (11.9%) and those who had no sexual contact
(4.1%) and higher among those who had sexual contact with
only females or with both sexes (11.9%) than those who had

with only females (4.7%) and those who had no sexual contact
(1.4%) and higher among those who had sexual contact with
only females (4.7%) than those who had no sexual contact
(1.4%). The prevalence also was higher among female students
who had sexual contact with only males (18.2%) than male
students who had sexual contact with only females (4.7%) and
higher among female students who had no sexual contact (4.1%)
than male students who had no sexual contact (1.4%).

Had a Sunburn
Nationwide, 55.8% of all students; 56.3% of heterosexual
students; 52.3% of gay, lesbian, and bisexual students; and
50.6% of not sure students had a sunburn (including even a
small part of their skin turning red or hurting for 12 hours or
more after being outside in the sun or after using a sunlamp
or other indoor tanning device) one or more times during the
12 months before the survey (i.e., had a sunburn) (Table 122).

Discussion
YRBSS has been measuring sexual identity and sex of sexual
contacts at the state and local levels longer than any other
public health surveillance system in the United States and has
now generated the first national estimates of the size of sexual
minority subgroups (as defined by sexual identity and sex of
sexual contacts) among students in grades 9–12. Other large,
national public health surveys (National Survey of Family
Growth, National Health Interview Survey, National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the National Survey
on Drug Use and Health) have published estimates of sexual
identity subgroups and/or sex of sexual contact subgroups
mostly for adults aged ≥18 years.
Although the majority of the 16,067,000 students estimated
to be attending public and private schools in grades 9–12
nationwide in 2015 (18) are heterosexual, this report indicates
that approximately 321,000 are gay or lesbian, 964,000 are
bisexual, and 514,000 are not sure of their sexual identity. In
addition, approximately 273,000 of all students in grades 9–12
have had sexual contact with only the same sex and 739,000

have had sexual contact with both sexes. Sexual minority
students are part of every community and are as racially,
ethnically, socially, economically, and geographically diverse
as their nonsexual minority peers.
Regardless of whether sexual identity or sex of sexual
contacts is used to describe sexual minority students, this
report documents that sexual minority students have a higher
prevalence of many health-risk behaviors compared with
nonsexual minority students. For example, across the 18
violence-related risk behaviors nationwide, the prevalence of
16 was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than
heterosexual students and the prevalence of 15 was higher
among students who had sexual contact with only the same
sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual contact
with only the opposite sex. For nine of these behaviors (did
not go to school because of safety concerns; having ever been
forced to have sexual intercourse; physical dating violence;
sexual dating violence; having felt sad or hopeless; seriously
considered attempting suicide; made a suicide plan; attempted
suicide; and made a suicide attempt that resulted in an injury,
poisoning, or overdose that had to be treated by a doctor or
nurse), gay, lesbian, or bisexual students had a twofold or
greater prevalence estimate than heterosexual students and for
nine of these behaviors (injured in a physical fight; did not go
to school because of safety concerns; having ever been forced
to have sexual intercourse; physical dating violence; sexual
dating violence; seriously considered attempting suicide; make
a suicide plan; attempted suicide; and made a suicide attempt
that resulted in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that had
to be treated by a doctor or nurse) students who had sexual
contact with only the same sex or with both sexes had a twofold
or greater prevalence estimate than students who had sexual
contact with only the opposite sex.
Across the 13 tobacco use-related risk behaviors, the
prevalence of 11 was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual
students than heterosexual students and the prevalence of 10
was higher among students who had sexual contact with only
the same sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual
contact with only the opposite sex. For three of these behaviors
(having smoked a whole cigarette before age 13 years, current
frequent cigarette use, and current daily cigarette use) gay,
lesbian, or bisexual students had a twofold or greater prevalence
estimate than heterosexual students and for three of these
behaviors (current frequent cigarette use, smoking more than
10 cigarettes per day, and current daily cigarette use) students
who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both
sexes had a twofold or greater prevalence estimate than students
who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex.
Similarly, across the 19 alcohol or other drug use-related
risk behaviors, the prevalence of 18 was higher among gay,

lesbian, and bisexual students than heterosexual students
and the prevalence of 17 was higher among students who
had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes
than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite
sex. For nine of these behaviors (tried marijuana before age
13 years, ever used hallucinogenic drugs, ever used cocaine, ever
used ecstasy, ever used heroin, ever used methamphetamines,
ever took steroids without a doctor’s prescription, ever used
inhalants, and ever injected any illegal drug) gay, lesbian, or
bisexual students had a twofold or greater prevalence estimate
than heterosexual students and for seven of these behaviors
(ever used cocaine, ever used ecstasy, ever used heroin, ever
used methamphetamines, ever took steroids without a doctor’s
prescription, ever used inhalants, and ever injected any illegal
drug) students who had sexual contact with only the same
sex or with both sexes had a twofold or greater prevalence
estimate than students who had sexual contact with only the
opposite sex.
The same pattern also was evident across the six sexual
risk behaviors. The prevalence of five of these risk behaviors
was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than
heterosexual students and the prevalence of four was higher
among students who had sexual contact with only the same
sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual contact
with only the opposite sex. For two of these risk behaviors
(had sexual intercourse before aged 13 years and not using any
method to prevent pregnancy) gay, lesbian, or bisexual students
and students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or
with both sexes had a twofold or greater prevalence estimate
than heterosexual students and students who had sexual contact
with only the opposite sex, respectively.
When the results were examined for male and female
students separately, the same general patterns emerged for
violence-related risk behaviors, tobacco use-related risk
behaviors, alcohol or other drug use-related risk behaviors, and
sexual risk behaviors. In contrast, no clear pattern of differences
by sexual identity or sex of sexual contact subgroups overall
or for male and female students separately emerged for birth
control use, dietary behaviors, and physical activity. However,
the prevalence of not drinking water and not participating in
at least 60 minutes of physical activity on at least 1 day during
the 7 days before the survey was twofold or greater among
gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than heterosexual students.
This report also demonstrates that some students are not
yet sure of their sexual identity. Not sure students and gay,
lesbian, and bisexual students often have a similar prevalence
of many health-risk behaviors and not sure students often
have a higher prevalence of many health-risk behaviors than
heterosexual students. For example, across the 18 violencerelated risk behaviors nationwide, the prevalence of 15 was
78	

MMWR / August 12, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 9

higher among not sure students than heterosexual students and
across the 19 alcohol or other drug use-related risk behaviors,
the prevalence of 13 was higher among not sure students than
heterosexual students.
Further, this report demonstrates that students who had no
sexual contact have a much lower prevalance of most health-risk
behaviors compared with students who had sexual contact with
only the opposite sex and students who had sexual contact with
only the same sex or with both sexes. For example, across the
18 violence-related risk behaviors nationwide, the prevalence
of all 18 was higher among students who had sexual contact
with only the opposite sex and students who had sexual contact
with only the same sex or with both sexes than students who
had no sexual contact. Across the 13 tobacco use-related risk
behaviors, the prevalence of all 13 was higher among students
who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex and students
who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both
sexes than students who had no sexual contact. Similarly,
across the 19 alcohol or other drug use-related risk behaviors,
the prevalence of all 19 was higher among students who had
sexual contact with only the opposite sex and students who
had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes
than students who had no sexual contact.

Comparison of Data Across Sites
Because all the state and large urban school district surveys
share similar sampling designs, questionnaires, data collection
strategies, and data processing procedures, YRBS data can be
compared across the states and large urban school districts.
Across states, a substantial difference (i.e., a range of 25 or
more percentage points or a fivefold variation or greater)
was identified for 17 behaviors among heterosexual students;
38 behaviors among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students; 69
behaviors among not sure students; 19 behaviors among
students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex;
41 behaviors for students who had sexual contact with only the
same sex or with both sexes; and 27 behaviors for students who
had no sexual contact. Across the large urban school districts,
a substantial difference was identified for 18 behaviors among
heterosexual students; 38 behaviors among gay, lesbian, and
bisexual students; 58 behaviors among not sure students;
15 behaviors among students who had sexual contact with
only the opposite sex; 33 behaviors for students who had
sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes; and
25 behaviors for students who had no sexual contact. Only
eight behaviors (having been electronically bullied, seriously
considered attempting suicide, current marijuana use, ever took
prescription drugs without a doctor’s prescription, having sexual
intercourse with four or more persons during their life, eating

Surveillance Summaries

vegetables three or more times per day, not eating breakfast,
and being physically active for at least 60 minutes per day
on all 7 days) did not have a substantial difference across
any of the sexual identity or sex of sexual contact subgroups
among states or large urban school districts. The substantial
differences across states and large urban school districts
may reflect differences in state and local laws and policies,
enforcement practices, access to drugs, availability of effective
school and community interventions, prevailing behavioral and
social norms (including attitudes toward sexual minorities),
the amount of stigma and discrimination, demographic
characteristics of the population, and adult practices and
health-related behaviors. The differences also highlight how
changes in one or more of these factors might contribute to
reductions in health-risk behaviors within and across states and
large urban school districts among students in grades 9–12.

Public Health Action
Most sexual minority students cope with the transition
from childhood through adolescence to adulthood successfully
and become healthy and productive adults. However, some
sexual minority students struggle because of the disparities in
health-related behaviors documented in this report, particularly
violence-related behaviors and alcohol and other drug use,
that can be compounded by stigma, discrimination, and
homophobia. Because many health-related behaviors initiated
during adolescence often extend into adulthood, they can
potentially have a life-long negative effect on health outcomes,
educational attainment, employment, housing, and overall
quality of life.
Schools have a unique and important role to play in
addressing the health-related behaviors of sexual minority
students. In particular, schools can help reduce stigma and
discrimination by creating and sustaining positive school
environments which are associated with less suicide ideation
and fewer suicide attempts, lower prevalence of substance use,
and fewer school absences among sexual minority students
(19–22). This might be accomplished through the following
policies and practices:
•	 Encourage respect for all students and do not allow
bullying, harassment, or violence against any student.
•	 Identify “safe spaces” (e.g., counselors’ offices, designated
classrooms, or student organizations) where sexual
minority students can get support from administrators,
teachers, or other school staff.
•	 Encourage student-led and student-organized school clubs
(e.g., gay/straight alliances) that promote school
connectedness and a safe, welcoming, and accepting school
environment for all students.

•	 Ensure that health classes and educational materials
include information that is relevant to sexual minority
students and use inclusive words or terms.
•	 Implement professional development opportunities and
encourage all school staff to attend on how to create safe
and supportive school environments for all students,
regardless of sexual minority status.
•	 Make it easier for students to have access to community-based
health care providers who have experience providing health
services, including HIV/STD testing and counseling and
social and psychological services, to sexual minority youth.
•	 Promote parent engagement through outreach efforts and
educational programs that provide parents with the
information and skills they need to help support sexual
minority youth.
The 2014 School Health Policies and Practices Study
(SHPPS) (23) indicates that nationwide during 2014, 21.5% of
middle schools and 51.5% of high schools taught about sexual
identity and sexual orientation as part of required instruction.
In addition, 20.2% of middle schools and 34.6% of high
schools provided health services specifically for gay, lesbian, and
bisexual students and 17.7% of middle schools and 13.9% of
high schools provided services specifically for gay, lesbian, and
bisexual students through providers not on school property.
Nationwide, 12.0% of school health services coordinators in
elementary schools, 10.1% in middle schools, and 16.6% in
high schools and 22.4% of school mental health and social
services coordinators in elementary schools, 21.2% in middle
schools, and 29.7% in high schools had received professional
development on services specifically for gay, lesbian, and
bisexual students during the 2 years before the study.
Schools address bullying through both policies and
practices. According to SHPPS, nationwide in 2014, 98.5%
of elementary, middle, and high schools had adopted a policy
prohibiting bullying on school property; 90.7% had adopted
a policy prohibiting bullying at off-campus, school-sponsored
events; 91.2% had adopted a policy prohibiting electronic
aggression or cyber-bullying on school property; and 84.8%
had adopted a policy prohibiting electronic aggression or cyberbullying at off-campus, school-sponsored events. In addition,
81.5% of elementary schools, 86.5% of middle schools, and
66.2% of high schools had or participated in a program to
prevent bullying.
School Health Profiles (Profiles) (24) provides additional
information about how schools nationwide are addressing the
health-related behaviors of sexual minority youth. Specifically
in 2014, a median of 26.7% of middle and high schools
across 47 states had a gay/straight alliance or similar club and
a median of 61.4% of middle and high schools identified safe
spaces where sexual minority students can receive support from

administrators, teachers, or other school staff. During 2008–
2014, in 15 of 37 states, significant increases were observed
in the percentage of secondary schools having a gay/straight
alliance or similar club, and in 26 of 36 states significant
increases were observed in the percentage of secondary
schools identifying safe spaces for sexual minority students.
Nonetheless, these SHPPS and Profiles data demonstrate
how much more schools could be doing to address the needs
of sexual minority students and the health-risk behaviors
they practice.
CDC provides funding and technical assistance to education
agencies in 18 states and the District of Columbia and to 17
large urban school districts to help schools implement effective
policies and practices to reduce sexual risk behaviors among
youth. These programs are focusing increasingly on sexual
minority youth as part of their HIV, STD, and pregnancy
prevention activities. Examples of program activities include:
providing training for district and school staff to ensure that
health curricula are inclusive of and relevant to sexual minority
students, supporting schools in establishing gay/straight
alliances and safe and supportive environments for sexual
minority students, linking schools to community organizations
that provide sexual health services for sexual minority youth,
and developing resources to help school staff understand the
special concerns and needs of sexual minority students. In
addition, CDC provides funding and technical assistance to
47 states and 21 large urban school districts to conduct YRBS.
State and local education and health agencies are using their
YRBS data on sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts to inform
a variety of policies and programs designed to help reduce healthrisk behaviors among sexual minority students. For example, the
Connecticut State Department of Education used their YRBS
data to identify the needs of populations that are disproportionally
affected by HIV, other sexually transmitted infections, and teen
pregnancy and help develop Guidelines for the Sexual Health
Education Component of Comprehensive Health Education for
local school districts on best practice policies, programs, and
instruction in sexual health education. The Massachusetts
Department of Elementary and Secondary Education used their
YRBS data to describe the health-related needs of sexual minority
youth and to support schools in modifying their sexual health
curricula and lessons to make them more inclusive of all youth.
The state reported that, as a result, differences between the percent
of sexual minority youth and all other students who ever learned
about HIV in school were reduced. In addition, YRBS data were
used in a 2-day training of school counselors, social workers, and
nurses to help them understand the risks faced by sexual minority
youth in Massachusetts and how their support can help reduce
those risks. The Vermont Department of Education used their
YRBS data on sexual behaviors and sexual minority students in a
80	

MMWR / August 12, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 9

series of data briefs to help inform educators and the community
about the health-related needs of youth throughout the state. In
the District of Columbia, the DC Concerned Providers Coalition
used the District of Columbia YRBS data on sexual behaviors
and sexual minority students to initiate development of a youth
mentoring program for sexual minority youth and the District
of Columbia Child and Family Services Agency used their YRBS
data on sexual behaviors and sexual minority youth to support
the development and implementation of a training program
for working effectively with sexual minority youth involved in
the foster care system. The District reported that the training
program helped reduce complaints from sexual minority youth
about unfair or insensitive care while in a placement. The School
District of Philadelphia used their YRBS data on sexual minority
youth to implement changes in professional development
programs for teachers and other school staff to increase sensitivity
and understanding of the issues facing sexual minority youth
and to provide programming directly for students and parents.
The San Diego Unified School District distributed their YRBS
data on sexual minority students to superintendents, the Board
of Directors, principals, and other key stakeholders to support
sexuality education, sexual health services, and a revision to their
sexual health education curriculum to include age-appropriate
information and build support for gender minority students
district-wide. San Francisco Unified School District used their
YRBS data on sexual minority youth to support the creation of
gay/straight alliances, encourage schools to implement activities
during the school district’s LGBTQ Pride Month, assist in
implementation of curricula inclusive of all students, create
school-specific safer school strategies, and increase referrals to
and collaboration with community-based organizations that
serve sexual minority youth.

Limitations
The findings in this report are subject to at least eight
limitations. First, these data apply only to youth who attend
school and, therefore, are not representative of all persons
in this age group. Nationwide, in 2012, of persons aged
16–17 years, approximately 3% were not enrolled in a high
school program and had not completed high school (25).
Sexual minority youth might represent a disproportionate
percentage of high school dropouts and other youths who
are absent from or do not attend school (26). Second, the
extent of underreporting or overreporting of health-related
behaviors cannot be determined, although the survey questions
demonstrate good test-retest reliability (10,13). Third, some
students might not have known their sexual identity; might
have been unwilling to disclose it on the YRBS questionnaire;

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Surveillance Summaries

might have been unwilling to label themselves as heterosexual,
gay, lesbian, or bisexual; or might not have understood the
sexual identity question. Although the “not sure” response
option for the sexual identity question is a credible choice for
youth who might truly be unsure of their sexual identity at
this point in their lives, it is also possible that this response
option was selected by students who did not know what the
question or the other response options meant. Nonetheless,
evidence that the words used to describe various types of sexual
identity are unclear to youth is not available. Fourth, because
no definition was provided for sexual contact, it is likely that
students considered a range of sexual activities when responding
to this question, possibly including involuntary activities. Fifth,
the questions used to ascertain sexual minority status focused
only on sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts. Questions
focused on sexual attraction might have identified a different
subgroup of sexual minority students and different estimates
of health-related behaviors. Sixth, BMI is calculated on the
basis of self-reported height and weight, and, therefore, tends
to underestimate the prevalence of obesity and overweight (27).
Seventh, not all states and large urban school districts included
all of the standard questions on their YRBS questionnaire;
therefore, data for certain variables are not available for some
sites. Finally, these analyses are based on cross-sectional surveys
and can only provide an indication of association, not causality.

Conclusions
To reduce the disparities in health-related behaviors
experienced by sexual minority students, it is important to
use this and other reports based on scientifically sound data to
raise awareness about the prevalence of priority health-related
behaviors among sexual minority students in grades 9–12
among policy makers, the public, and a wide variety of agencies
and organizations that work with youth. These agencies and
organizations, including schools and youth-friendly health
care providers, can help facilitate access to education, health
care, and evidence-based interventions designed to address
priority health-related behaviors among sexual minority
youth. It is also important to continue to implement YRBSS
at the national, state, and large urban school district levels
to document and monitor the effect of broad policy and
programmatic interventions on the health-related behaviors
of sexual minority youth. In particular, more states could
include questions on sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts
on their YRBS questionnaire. Because sexual minority students
represent a relatively small proportion of all students, use of
large, population-based samples of students is key to obtaining
the most generalizable and highest quality data on which to

base policy and programmatic decisions that can help eliminate
the health-related behavior disparities and improve health
status, educational outcomes, and overall quality of life for
sexual minority and all youth.
