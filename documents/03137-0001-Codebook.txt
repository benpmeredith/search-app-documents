In order to study the relationship between victimization at school and the school environment, and to monitor changes in student experiences with victimization, accurate information regarding its incidence must be collected. The Census Bureau conducts an ongoing survey called the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) for the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). This survey is a major source of statistical information about the nature and extent of crime throughout the United States. Periodically, along with the regular NCVS information, additional information is obtained about specific issues related to crime using a supplemental survey instrument. The 1999 School Crime Supplement (SCS) was the third implementation of an occasional supplement to the annual NCVS to obtain specific information about school related victimization and disorder on a national level. The SCS was fielded first in 1989, and then again in 1995 and 1999. The initial fielding in 1989 was conducted by the BJS in conjunction with the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). The 1995 supplement was jointly sponsored by the BJS and the NCES. The 1999 SCS was sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics, which plans to conduct the SCS as a supplement to the NCVS every two years. The 2001 supplement began in January and will continue for six months through June 2001. Since the SCS is a supplement to 3 the NCVS, it is conducted under the authority of title 42, United States Code, sections 3732. Only Census employees sworn to preserve confidentiality may see the completed questionnaires. The primary purpose of the School Crime Supplement is to obtain additional information about school-related victimizations so that policy-makers, academic researchers, practitioners at the Federal, state and local levels, and special interest groups who are concerned with crime in schools can make informed decisions concerning policies and programs. The SCS asks questions related to students. experiences with, and perceptions of crime and safety at school, including preventive measures employed by schools, students. participation in after school activities, students. perception of school rules and enforcement of these rules, the presence of weapons, drugs, alcohol, and gangs in school, student bullying, hate-related incidents, and attitudinal questions relating to the fear of victimization at school. These responses are linked to the NCVS survey instrument responses for a more complete understanding of the individual student.s circumstances. Eligibility for the 1999 SCS included persons ages 12 to 18 in all NCVS households (including first time in sample households) who had attended school at any time during the 6 months preceding the interview and were enrolled in a school which would advance them towards the eventual receipt of a high school diploma. Persons who had dropped out of school, who had been expelled or suspended from school or who were temporarily absent from school for any other reason, such as an illness or vacation, were eligible for the survey as long as they were attending school at any time during the six months prior to the month of interview. Persons 4 attending home school were also eligible, but were only asked questions to determine if they were in a home school situation because the supplement questions were not relevant. The SCS was administered at the end of the NCVS interview for each eligible respondent. The 1999 SCS was conducted from January through June 1999. Of the 12,166 NCVS respondents eligible for the SCS supplement, 77.6% completed the SCS interview. The remaining 22.4 % were noninterviews. For both the NCVS and the SCS, two modes of data collection were used: paper-and-pencil interviewing (PAPI) and computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). In PAPI, households are interviewed in person or by telephone and the responses are entered on a paper instrument. In CATI, the interview is conducted by an interviewer who is calling from a centralized telephone facility using an automated version of the paper instrument to administer the supplement questions and record the respondent.s answers. PAPI is used in approximately 70% of the households and CATI the remaining 30%. Approximately 90% of all interviews are conducted by phone with the other 10% conducted by personal visit. Each month the U.S. Census Bureau selects respondents for the NCVS using a .rotating panel. design. Households are randomly selected and all age-eligible individuals become part of the panel. The sample of households is divided into groups or rotations. Once in the sample, respondents are interviewed every six months for a total of seven interviews over a three-year period. The first interview is considered the incoming rotation. The second through the seventh 5 interview are in the continuing rotations. The first interview is face-to-face; the rest are by telephone unless the circumstances call for an in-person interview. After the seventh interview the household leaves the panel and a new household is rotated into the sample. The rotation scheme is used to reduce respondent burden that may result if they were to remain permanently in the sample. The SCS was administered at all NCVS households interviewed from January through June 1999. 6 SURVEY DESIGN Sample Size The target population for the 1999 SCS was defined to be all persons in the NCVS sample who were ages 12 to18, had attended school at any time during the six months prior to the month of the interview, and who were enrolled in a school which would advance them towards the eventual receipt of a high school diploma. In 1989 and 1995, NCVS sample household members age 12-19 were considered eligible to receive the SCS. However, it was determined that most 19 year olds did not meet the eligibility criteria of being currently enrolled in a post-secondary school so the upper range was lowered to 18 years old for the 1999 SCS. From January 1999 through June 1999, 12,166 NCVS respondents were eligible for the SCS. Of these respondents, 9,442 , or 77.6%, completed the SCS interview. Questionnaire Development The Bureau of Justice Statistics, the National Center for Education Statistics, and the Census Bureau jointly designed the survey questionnaire. Since many of the questions used in the 1995 survey were incorporated in the 1999 instrument, only minimal testing of the questionnaire was conducted for 1999. Based upon the results of the testing, some minor modifications, mostly wording changes, were made to the instrument. 7 The final questionnaire consisted of six sections. They included: * Screen Questions - The first section contained the screen questions which were asked to determine if the respondent was eligible for the SCS. * Environmental Questions - This section obtained selected information on the type of school the student attended, including whether the school was private or public, the grade levels taught, measures taken by the school to ensure student safety, and the availability of drugs and alcohol in school. *Victimization, Bullying, and Hate Crimes - The third section contained the victimization questions which identified or distinguished the nature and extent of the crimes. These questions were designed to elicit crimes that occurred only at school, that is, in the school building, on school grounds, or on a school bus. *Avoidance - The fourth section contained avoidance questions which identified the effect of fear of crime on behavior. The avoidance questions were designed to determine if students stayed away from school or particular places at school, or avoided participating in extra-curricular activities at their school for fear of being attacked or harmed. *Weapons - The fifth section asked questions pertaining to weapons. The purpose of these questions was to determine if students brought weapons to school for protection. 8 *Gangs - The sixth section contained questions relating to the presence of organized gangs at school and whether students came into contact with gangs or gang members at school. The 1989, 1995 and 1999 instruments differ in some respects. Due to the significant changes that occurred to the NCVS data collection procedure and instrument during the 1992 redesign, caution should be used when comparing results from the 1989 SCS to either the 1995 or the 1999 SCS.1 Compared to the 1995 supplement, the 1999 instrument added new questions and changed wording of some existing questions as follows: *Screen Questions - The 1999 SCS added a question about whether the respondent was home-schooled. *School Environment - The 1999 SCS removed the question about whether students spend most of their day in the same room. The 1999 SCS asked students about alcohol and drugs in two questions. Students were first asked whether it was possible to obtain alcohol and selected drugs. If it was possible, they were asked the degree of difficultly in obtaining these items. The 1995 SCS asked students only about the difficulty in obtaining alcohol or specific drugs. 1For changes between the 1989 and 1995 instruments and data collection procedures, consult the 1995 School Crime Supplement Codebook, [ICPSR 6739]. 9 *Victimization - The 1999 SCS: *reworded the victimization screening question to elicit incidents in addition to those reported in the NCVS, *provided a list of what actually happened (attack, threaten to attack) rather than ask separate questions for each type of incident as was done in the 1995 SCS, *added .threaten to attack you. as a type of victimization, *added questions about hate-related words (directed at the respondent and in the form of graffiti) and bullying, *removed the question about monetary loss resulting from theft, and *removed questions concerning the details of a physical attack (number of times the respondent was victimized, the amount of money stolen, injuries sustained, whether the respondent went to a doctor as a result of the victimization, and whether the attack was just a fight). *Avoidance - The 1999 SCS added questions about avoiding classes and staying home from school because of the student.s fear of being attacked. The 1999 SCS added a question about fear outside of school. *Weapons - The 1999 SCS reworded the question about bringing weapons to school and only asked specifically about guns and knives. *Gangs - The 1999 SCS removed the question concerning the student.s knowledge of 10 gangs (gang.s name, colors, etc.) as well as the question about gangs bringing guns to school and the student.s knowledge that street gangs exist. Responses from the completed SCS are linked to the individual.s responses from the NCVS instruments: NCVS-1and NCVS-2 (if applicable). The NCVS-1 is the basic screener questionnaire used to record characteristics of all household members 12 years of age and older in a sample unit, as well as to screen for incidents of crime which were committed against the household and/or household members. When a person reports a crime in the screen questions, a crime incident report, the NCVS-2, is used to gather the detailed information about each incident. One crime incident report is completed for each incident to obtain information about the characteristics of the event, including offender information, location, victim behaviors, weapon use and police response. For more detail on the NCVS data collection process consult the National Crime Victimization Codebook, 1992-1999 [ICPSR 6406], 2001. Response Rates Unit response rates indicate how many sampled units completed interviews. Because interviews with students could only be completed in households that responded to the NCVS, the unit completion rate for the SCS reflects both the NCVS household interview completion rate and the student interview completion rate.2 2The response rate for households with students between the ages of 12 and 19 (for the 1989 and 1995 SCS) and between the ages of 12 and 18 (for the 1999 SCS) was not calculated, but is assumed to be the same as that of all households. The reported unit response rates are unweighted. 11 1985 1995 1999 Household Completion Rate 96.5 95.1 93.8 Student Completion Rate 86.5 77.5 77.6 Overall SCS Response Rate 83.5 73.7 72.8 The rate at which the respondents provide a valid response to a given item is referred to as its item response rate. Item response rates for items on the NCVS and SCS are generally high. Most items were answered by over 95 percent of all eligible respondents. The only exception was the household income question, which was answered by approximately 86 percent of all households in 1999 and approximately 90 percent of all households in 1995 and 1989. Income and income-related questions typically have relatively lower response rates due to their sensitive nature. In 1992, the National Crime Survey (NCS) was redesigned and renamed the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). Because of the redesign, victimization estimates from the 1995 and 1999 SCS cannot be readily compared to the 1989 estimates. One of the many changes made during the redesign was the implementation of a different screening procedure meant to elicit a more complete tally of victimization incidents than did the one used in the 1989 NCS. For instance, the 1995 and 1999 screener specifically asked whether respondents had been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted, whereas the 1989 screener did not. Therefore, cross-year changes between pre- and post-redesign stages in reported victimization rates, or lack thereof, may only 12 be the result of changes in how the questions were asked.3 There were no modifications to the NCVS screener questions between the 1995 and 1999 SCS. For most types of crime, the redesigned methods elicit more reports of victimizations. However, the effect is not uniform across all types of crime and sub-populations. For example, some crime categories, such as assault, are affected more by the NCVS redesign than others, such as robbery. Other effects of the NCVS redesign include improved estimates of certain hard to enumerate crimes such as domestic violence, rape and sexual attack (Rand, Lynch and Cantor, 1997). Because NCVS questionnaires are completed before students are given the SCS questionnaire, it is likely that changes to NCVS victimization screening procedures completed in 1992 differentially affected responses in 1995 and 1999 SCS victimization items. While the assumption is not possible to test, it is nonetheless reasonable to expect that by providing a more detailed victimization screening instrument in the 1995 and 1999 NCVS, respondents in these years had improved victimization recall than did 1989 SCS respondents. Length of Interview Each SCS interview took an average of about 10 minutes to complete. 3 For more details about this issue, see Kinderman, Lynch, and Cantor (1997). 13 INTERVIEWING PROCEDURES Eligibility NCVS interviews are conducted with each household member age 12 years old or older. In 1999 only household members ages 12 to 18 were given an SCS interview, following a completed NCVS interview. Persons ages 12 to 18 who were in primary or secondary education programs leading to a high school diploma (elementary through high school), and who had been enrolled sometime during the 6 months prior to the interview, were administered the 1999 SCS questionnaire. Persons who had dropped out of school; been expelled or suspended from school; or who were temporarily absent from school for any other reason, such as illness or vacation, were eligible as long as they were attending school at any time during the six months prior to the month of the interview. Students who were home schooled were not included past the screening questions since it was determined that many of the questions in the SCS were not relevant to their situation. School, for SCS purposes, was defined as any institution designed to advance a person towards a high school diploma. This included graded public or private elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, home schools, Church schools, and vocational or trade schools that led to a high school diploma. Not included were persons attending colleges or universities, except in cases where a high school student was taking an upper level course before the high school diploma was obtained; persons seeking their GED; persons attending night school; and persons attending vocational trade, business, correspondence, or other specialized schools that are not associated 14 with academics such as beauty schools and mechanic schools. For both the NCVS and the SCS, two modes of data collection were used: paper-and-pencil interviewing (PAPI) and computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). In PAPI, households are interviewed in person or by telephone and the responses are entered on a paper instrument. In CATI, the interview is conducted by an interviewer calling from a centralized telephone facility using an automated version of the paper instrument to administer the supplement questions and record the respondent.s answers. The Census Bureau has two centralized telephone facilities for the NCVS located in Hagerstown, MD and Tucson, AZ. PAPI is used in approximately 70% of the households and CATI the remaining 30%. For the 1999 SCS, PAPI was used in approximately 77% of the households and CATI in the remaining 23% (n=2157). Approximately 72% of all interviews were conducted by phone (both CATI and non-CATI) with the other 28% conducted by personal visit. Telephone interviews accounted for 6,824 of the 9,442 SCS interviews in 1999. Proxy Interview The same proxy respondent rules apply to the SCS that apply to the NCVS. Proxy interviews are interviews conducted in which one household member answers the questions for another in the household. For the SCS, household members ages 12 to 18 were interviewed directly except in limited situations in which proxy interviews were accepted. If the interview was a proxy for the NCVS, a proxy interview was acceptable for the SCS. Proxy interviews were allowed only under the following circumstances: *If a child was 12 or 13 years old, a self-response interview was attempted. If parents 15 refused to let the interviewer speak to the 12 or 13 year old, a proxy interview could be conducted with the parent. *If a household member between ages 12 to 18 years old was temporarily absent and not expected to return to the sample household at all during the interview period, a proxy interview was acceptable. *A proxy interview was accepted if a household member was considered physically or mentally unable to answer the questions. Specifically, the person must have been unable to be interviewed due to health problems or mental incompetence. Further, this condition must have been continuous during the entire interview period and did not include colds or flu, temporary incapacitation, or problems that might have been aggravated because the respondent found the questions upsetting. If an interview could not be obtained, and one of the above situations did not exist, a proxy interview was not allowable and the respondent was considered a noninterview. Proxy interviews accounted for 755 of the 9,442 interviews in 1999. Noninterviews A person was considered a noninterview for the SCS if: *the person was an NCVS noninterview, *the person was an NCVS interview but refused or was unavailable for the SCS interview, *the person was physically or mentally unable to answer the questions and no proxy was 16 available, or *an acceptable proxy respondent refused to give a proxy SCS interview. Interviewers were instructed to compete selected items on the SCS questionnaire to identify each type of noninterview. Of the 12,166 eligible respondents, there were 2,724 noninterview persons, or 22.4 percent of the eligible SCS sample. Responses to both the NCVS and SCS are confidential by law by the BJS under title 42, United States Code, sections 3735 and 3789g, and by the Census Bureau under title 13, United States Code, section 9. Interviewers are instructed to conduct interviews in privacy unless respondents specifically agree to permit others to be present. Most interviews for the NCVS and SCS were conducted by telephone, and most questions required .yes. or .no. answers, thereby affording respondents a further measure of privacy. By law, identifiable information about respondents may not be disclosed or released to others for any purpose. General Interviewing Sequence The general interview sequence for the SCS was to ask all appropriate NCVS questions of one household member and if eligible for the SCS, ask all appropriate SCS questions before proceeding on to the next household member. This is done to avoid any increase in NCVS nonresponse due to the supplemental questions. The NCVS-1, the screen questionnaire, describes criminal incidents using everyday language in order to ascertain whether the respondent has been victimized during the six months prior to interview. The screening section relies on a series of cues and questions to describe various behaviors and characteristics of a criminal event. 17 Any positive responses are followed by the incident report (NCVS-2), detailing the specific characteristics of each incident. Once the NCVS data collection process is complete, each eligible respondent is administered the SCS. For more detail on the NCVS consult the National Crime Victimization Codebook, 1992-1999 [ICPSR 6406], 2001. Training Interviewers received special training for the 1999 SCS in addition to their NCVS training and experience. For PAPI and CATI interviewers, the Census Bureau developed separate manuals and self-studies. The manuals provided detailed information about the content and administration of the 1999 SCS, covering each item in the questionnaire and addressing concepts related to the SCS. The CATI and PAPI self-studies provided basic facts, general procedures, and instructions for conducting the SCS. The training materials for interviewers differed in one respect between the 1995 and the 1999 SCS. The 1995 SCS included a practice interview in the self-study which took the trainee through a SCS interview. In 1999 practice exercises were included in the self-studies which provided scenarios for interviewers to resolve. This approach was adopted since it was felt to be a better way to address issues that interviewers might encounter during SCS interviewing. 18 CLERICAL AND COMPUTER PROCESSING Once the data were collected, the SCS went through clerical review and computer editing to ensure high data quality. Clerical processing prepares the data for computer processing through a two step operation: clerical editing and the keying of the data to magnetic tape. Both are also performed on the NCVS data. For PAPI, interviewers edit the SCS questionnaires for completeness and accuracy before transmitting them to their respective Census Bureau regional office (RO). In the ROs, the forms are edited for completeness and accuracy and then sent to the National Processing Center (NPC) in Jeffersonville, Indiana for check-in, clerical editing, and keying. The keyed files are then sent to Census headquarters for post data collection processing. For CATI, completed cases are transmitted daily from the Telephone Centers (TCs) to headquarters for post data-collection processing. Clerical Edits The main purpose of the SCS clerical edit was to locate and correct any interviewer errors made during PAPI data collection and, when possible, correct areas of respondent misunderstanding. Such errors could only be identified by clerical review of the data. Errors were corrected in an effort to improve the accuracy and quality of the data. Along with any accompanying NCVS form, SCS forms containing errors that could not be resolved by NPC staff were sent to 19 headquarters staff for resolution during a .referral. process. All resolved SCS referrals and their accompanying NCVS forms were then returned to the NPC. Upon completion of the clerical edit, coding, and verification, the questionnaires were transmitted to the Electronic Data Processing unit in Jeffersonville, Indiana for data keying. A quality control measure was employed to ensure an acceptable level of quality of keying. All keying was verified on a 100 percent basis. Upon completion of keying and verification, the data for each work unit were read to tape and transmitted to Census Bureau Headquarters in Washington, D.C. for computer processing. Computer Processing Following the clerical processing and keying of the data, computer processing was initiated. Computer processing involves merging, matching and editing the NCVS and SCS files. Only NCVS households with household members ages 12 to 18 were matched to the SCS file. SCS records which did not match to an NCVS record and were not able to be matched through a review and editing process were eventually dropped from the file. For the entire six month period, there were 370 NCVS persons age 12 to 18 who did not match to an SCS person record. There were also 314 persons who did not match to an NCVS person, so these SCS records were deleted. Overall, there was a 97% SCS match to the total eligible NCVS persons age 12 to 18. For the 1999 SCS computer editing was performed using a generalized edit system designed to identify (not correct) response errors and compilation errors. The following computer editing 20 tasks were used for the 1999 SCS data: required data item test, range test, skip pattern validation test, list directed edits, survey rules validation and blanking edit. a. Required Data Item Test - The purpose of this test is to validate the data items that must be present are in fact present, evidenced by the fact that the data item does not contain missing value code (.) as the data value. Required data items are items which must be completed by all respondents. If a required data item contains a missing value, there is an error. b. Range Test - The purpose of this edit test is to validate that the data values present are within tolerance for the given data item. If the data value is either too large or too small the data item is identified as an error. Range tests are typically only performed against continuous data items not against discrete data items. c.Skip Pattern Validation Tests - The purpose of the Skip Pattern Validation Tests is to determine if the data values of skip items are consistent with the skip instructions as given on the questionnaire. These edits are often referred to as .consistency tests.. A skip instruction qualifies a respondent to provide information on a topic covered within a survey. The skip instruction ascertains if the respondent exhibited a behavior encompassed by the specific survey subsection. If the respondent positively indicates that the behavior covered in the survey subsection is germane then additional questions are asked of the respondent. If the skip instruction determines that the subsection is not germane then the subsection is skipped. 21 d. List Directed edits - The purpose of a list directed edit is to validate that the data value for a specified data item exactly matches one of the data values on a specified list. The list contains all the valid data values that the specified data item can assume and be considered valid. If the specified data item.s data value is not contained on the list then that data item is invalid. e.Survey Rules Validation - The purpose of these tests are to validate complex interitem relationships within an observation. These tests determine if the specified relationships between data items are true. If the statement is false then there is an error situation. f. Blanking Edit - After the generalized edit modules are complete, the data were passed through a blanking edit. This edit checked to make sure that the case followed the appropriate skip pattern by stepping sequentially through the items. It deleted entries that should not have been filled. An .out-of-universe. code was assigned to all items that failed the edit. File Structure A six-month NCVS/SCS person-level public use file was created. The NCVS/SCS file contains data for 1) all households containing SCS-eligible persons (interviewed and noninterviewed, incoming (unbounded) and continuing rotations), 2) all SCS-eligible persons (interviewed and noninterviewed) within these households, and 3) all incidents reported by the SCS-eligible persons. The file does not contain information for any households that did not have SCS-eligible 22 persons in them, nor does it contain information for any persons within a household other than those who were SCS-eligible. That is, if a household contained one non SCS-eligible person and one SCS-eligible person, only the SCS-eligible person information was included as a record on the file. The NCVS data are contained in a hierarchically structured file. There are four unique record types: * Record Type 001, the address record, contains limited information about the household. * Record Type 002, contains the entire NCVS household record. * Record Type 003, contains the entire NCVS person record which was expanded to include the 1999 SCS information. * Record Type 004, contains the entire incident record. For the SCS, these records were restructured into a single record for each SCS person, containing an expanded incident record to include information on all incidents reported by that respondent in the same record. A maximum number of seven incidents was needed to capture all the incidents reported by a single respondent. That is, no SCS person reported more than seven incidents in 1999. The SCS data file is rectangular where each case on the public use tapes represents an SCS individual with between zero and seven incidents. Prior to its release, the file was reviewed by the Census Bureau.s Disclosure Review Board (DRB) to ensure that the contents of the file did not violate any disclosure avoidance measures. 23 For confidentiality protection of the public use file, recoding procedures and a control number scrambling routine were performed before the file was released for public use. For the 1999 NCVS/SCS file a control number scrambling routine was used that differed from the NCVS control number scrambling routine to prevent matching the two files. In addition, data that may have provided geographic information by inference were blanked because of data confidentiality reasons. Although the school attended was uniquely coded, the DRB mandated that this code be suppressed in the public use file to avoid disclosure of information about any one individual. 24 GENERATING ESTIMATES Because the National Crime Victimization Survey and School Crime Supplement Survey sample represents the U.S. population 12 years and older, population estimates can be generated from the sample cases. That is, the data collected can be used to make inferences about the 12- to 18-yearold student population in 1999. Before such inferences can be made, it is important to adjust the sample to assure that the sample is similar to the entire population of such students. Each person interviewed in the survey represents a probable percentage of all cases if the total population were to be interviewed. Multiplying each case by a factor (i.e., weight) adjusts the unweighted counts to the population size. The final weight adjusts for unequal probabilities of selection. The SCS public use file provides two weights which are used depending whether NCVS or SCS estimates are being generated. Weighting The weights created for the SCS are a combination of household level and person level adjustment factors. In the NCVS, adjustments were made to account for both household and person non-interviews. Additional factors were then applied to reduce the variance of the estimate by correcting for the differences between sample distribution of age, race, and sex, and known population distributions of these characteristics. This also reduced the bias due to undercoverage of various portions of the population. The resulting weights were assigned to all interviewed households and persons on the file. 25 Modifications to the regular NCVS weighting program were necessary for the weighting of the SCS file. For the SCS the NCVS data had to be weighted twice: once including continuing rotations only and once including all rotations (both incoming and continuing). Incoming rotations are those households interviewed for the first time for the NCVS. Modified weighting procedures were necessary because of the following differences between SCS and NCVS: * The eligible population for SCS differs from the eligible population for NCVS. * A person can respond to the NCVS and not the SCS. * For select SCS items, the incoming rotation contributes to the estimates as well as continuing rotations. For the NCVS, only continuing rotations contribute to estimates. Households in the incoming rotations are not included in the NCVS estimates (i.e., have a weight of zero) since the data for these cases are .unbounded.. The purpose of the initial NCVS interview is for purposes of bounding, that is, to learn about all crimes occurring previously in order to keep the respondent from reporting them in subsequent interviews. A special weighting adjustment was performed on the SCS data. Noninterview adjustment factors were computed to adjust the weighting for SCS noninterviews.  Two SCS person weights were computed as a result of applying special adjustment factors to the NCVS final person weight. * The first SCS weight computed was derived using the final NCVS person weight that was calculated for all interviewed persons in interviewed continuing households and applying a within-SCS noninterview adjustment factor. This weight, which should be used if producing NCVS estimates using only the continuing rotations, is located in the 26 NCVS section of the NCVS/SCS person record. * The second SCS weight was derived using the final NCVS person weight that was calculated for all interviewed persons in interviewed continuing and incoming households with a within-SCS noninterview adjustment factor applied. This weight, which should be used if producing SCS estimates using all rotations, is located in the SCS section of the NCVS/SCS person record. A third weight, the incident weight, is not available on the public use file, but can be generated using the person weight and the number of victims involved (variable source code 683) for each incident. To calculate the incident weight, multiply the person weight by the multiple-victim adjustment factor. The multiple-victim adjustment factor is simply 1 divided by the number of victims present during the incident (SC 680). This weight is most frequently used to compute estimates of the characteristics of crime incidents (e.g., time of occurrence). Comparing student victimization rates between the three supplements (1989, 1995 and 1999) should be made with caution. For the 1989 and the 1995 SCS, 19-year-old household members also were considered eligible for the SCS interview. This upper age range was lowered to 18 for eligibility in the 1999 SCS because it was determined that most 19-year-olds did not meet the other eligibility requirement of being currently enrolled in a secondary school. In addition, due to the redesign of the NCVS in 1992, NCVS item-based cross-year changes in reported victimization rates, or lack thereof, may only be the result of changes in how the questions were asked and not of actual changes in the incidence of victimization. Because NCVS questionnaires 27 were completed before students were given the SCS, it is likely that these changes to the NCVS victimization screening procedures differentially affected responses to the 1989 and 1995 SCS victimization items. Other items, such as fear at school, avoidance of places at school, and reports of gangs at school, followed the victimization items on the SCS survey. Standard Errors The sample of students selected for each SCS is just one of many possible samples that could have been selected. It is possible that estimates from a given SCS student sample may differ from estimates that would have been produced from other student samples. This type of variability is called sampling error, or the standard error, because it arises from using a sample of students rather than all students. The standard error is a measure of the variability of a parameter estimate. It indicates how much variation there is in the population of possible estimates of a parameter for a given sample size. The probability that a complete census count would differ from the sample estimate by less than 1 standard error is about 68 percent. The chance that the difference would be less than 1.65 standard errors is about 90 percent, and that the difference would be less than 1.96 standard errors, about 95 percent. Standard errors are typically developed assuming that the sample is drawn purely at random. The sample for the SCS was not a simple random sample, however. The NCVS and SCS rely on a stratified, multi-stage cluster sample design. Standard errors should be calculated by taking this 28 .design effect. into consideration. Failure to take it into account will compromise statistical tests. Calculating standard errors by assuming a simple random sample (which is the default in most statistical software packages) when in fact a cluster sample was used results in standard errors that are smaller than when taking cluster sampling into consideration. Further, estimates are generally computed on weighted rather than raw data, which are sums of the weights of the cases selected. Computing standard errors on these sums as if they were independent observations would produce artificially small results and thus compromise the statistical tests involved. Calculation of the standard errors requires procedures that are markedly different from the ones used when the data are from a simple random sample. One can use direct variance calculation methods designed for complex survey designs (See National Crime Victimization Codebook, 1992-1999 [ICPSR 6406], 2001), or compute statistics and standard errors by using generalized variance function (gvf) constant parameters. The gvf represents the curve fitted to the individual standard errors calculated using the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique.4 The three constant parameters (a, b, and c) derived from the curve fitting process are provided below for those who prefer to use this alternative method of calculating standard errors: 4 A more detailed description of the generalized variance function constant parameters developed for the NCVS and SCS can be found in National Crime Victimization Codebook, 1992-1999 [ICPSR 6406], 2001. 29 Year a b c 1989 0.00001559 3,108 0.000 19951 -0.00006269 2,278 1.804 1999 -0.00026646 2,579 2.826 To calculate the standard errors associated with percentages, the following formula is used: standard error of p = y ppcp y pbp )()1.0 (. +. where p is the percentage of interest expressed as a proportion and y is the size of the population to which the percentage applies. Once the standard error of the proportion is estimated, it needs to be multiplied by 100 to make it applicable to the percentage. To calculate the adjusted standard errors associated with population counts, the following applies: 2 3/2standard error of x = ax + bx + cx where x is the estimated number of students who experienced a given event (e.g., violent victimization). The U.S. Bureau of the Census has developed a set of programs to calculate NCVS generalized 30 variance formulae, known as SIGMA programs. To facilitate use of these formulae, spreadsheet versions of these SIGMA programs are available on the BJS web site (www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/), which will allow users to enter gvf constants and values in appropriate cells. Spreadsheet macros will them calculate the appropriate variances and standard errors and perform tests for any differences requested. 31 Reference List of Articles Related to the School Crime Supplements, 1989, 1995 and 1999 Bastian, Lisa D. and Bruce M.

Each incident contains 522 variables which repeat seven times. In the codebook body, only the variable name of the first occurrence of an item (i.e., in the first incident) is listed. A complete list of variables that correspond to each other across incidents is listed below. If, for example, the user wishes to see the question text or review the coding of variable V1875 (I4: ARE INCIDENTS SIMILAR IN DETAIL), the user should refer to the codebook for the first occurrence of this variable: V309 (I1: ARE INCIDENTS SIMILAR IN DETAIL) in column location 496. The Census Bureau has listed two important variables, V821: Was it in your school? (source code 628) and V822: In what part of the building did it happen? (source code 629), at the end of the incident variables. These variables are new to the NCVS. They were added to the end of the incident variables in order to preserve the record layout of other variables. These two variables go with variable V330: How did the offender (get in/try to get in)? (source code627). Var Description Location V301 I1: LINE NUMBER OF RESPONDENT 481-482 V823 I2: LINE NUMBER OF RESPONDENT 1201-1202 V1345 I3: LINE NUMBER OF RESPONDENT 1921-1922 V1867 I4: LINE NUMBER OF RESPONDENT 2641-2642 V2389 I5: LINE NUMBER OF RESPONDENT 3361-3362 V2911 I6: LINE NUMBER OF RESPONDENT 4081-4082 V3433 I7: LINE NUMBER OF RESPONDENT 4801-4802 V302 I1: SCREEN Q.
