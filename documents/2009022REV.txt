The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is the primary federal entity for collecting, analyzing,
and reporting data related to education in the United States and other nations. It fulfills a congressional mandate to collect, collate, analyze, and report full and complete statistics on the condition of education in the
United States; conduct and publish reports and specialized analyses of the meaning and significance of such
statistics; assist state and local education agencies in improving their statistical systems; and review and report
on education activities in other countries.
The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) is the primary federal entity for collecting, analyzing, publishing, and
disseminating statistical information about crime, its perpetrators and victims, and the operation of the justice
system at all levels of government. These data are critical to federal, state, and local policymakers in combating
crime and ensuring that justice is both efficient and evenhanded.

Executive Summary
Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for
teaching and learning, free of crime and violence.
Any instance of crime or violence at school not
only affects the individuals involved, but also may
disrupt the educational process and affect bystanders,
the school itself, and the surrounding community
(Henry 2000).
Ensuring safer schools requires establishing good
indicators of the current state of school crime and
safety across the nation and regularly updating
and monitoring these indicators. This is the aim of
Indicators of School Crime and Safety.
This report is the eleventh in a series of annual
publications produced jointly by the National
Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Institute of
Education Sciences (IES), in the U.S. Department
of Education, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS) in the U.S. Department of Justice. This report
presents the most recent data available on school
crime and student safety. The indicators in this report
are based on information drawn from a variety of
data sources, including national surveys of students,
teachers, and principals. Sources include results from
a study of violent deaths in schools, sponsored by
the U.S. Department of Education and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention; the National
Crime Victimization Survey and School Crime
Supplement to the survey, sponsored by the BJS and
NCES, respectively; the Youth Risk Behavior Survey,
sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention; and the Schools and Staffing Survey and

School Survey on Crime and Safety, both sponsored
by NCES. The most recent data collection for each
indicator varied by survey, from 2003–04 to 2007.
Each data source has an independent sample design,
data collection method, and questionnaire design
or is the result of a universe data collection. All
comparisons described in this report are statistically
significant at the .05 level. In 2005 and 2007, the final
response rate for students ages 12–18 for the School
Crime Supplement (60 percent),1 fell below NCES
statistical standards; therefore, interpret the 2005
and 2007 data from Indicators 3, 8, 10, 11, 17, 18,
and 21 with caution. Additional information about
methodology and the datasets analyzed in this report
may be found in appendix A.
This report covers topics such as victimization, fights,
bullying, classroom disorder, weapons, student
perceptions of school safety, teacher injury, and
availability and student use of drugs and alcohol.
Indicators of crime and safety are compared across
different population subgroups and over time. Data
on crimes that occur away from school are offered as
a point of comparison where available.
1

Analysis of unit nonresponse found evidence that for some
demographic groups, there may be a response bias in that
the nonrespondents have different characteristics than those
who responded. Weighting adjustments, which corrected for
differential response rates, should have reduced the problem.
Therefore, while the results are valid, in interpreting the data
from Indicators 3, 8, 10, 11, 17, 18, and 21, a reader should
understand that these estimates may have larger and unmeasured sources of survey error than other estimates.

Key Findings
In the 2006–07 school year, an estimated 55.5 million
students were enrolled in prekindergarten through
grade 12 (U.S. Department of Education 2008).
Preliminary data show that among youth ages 5–18,
there were 35 school-associated violent deaths2 from
July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007 (27 homicides
and 8 suicides) (Indicator 1). In 2006, among students
ages 12–18, there were about 1.7 million victims
of nonfatal crimes at school,3 including 909,500
thefts4 and 767,000 violent crimes5 (simple assault
and serious violent crime6) (Indicator 2). During the
2005–06 school year, 86 percent of public schools
reported that at least one violent crime, theft, or other
crime occurred at their school (Indicator 6). In 2007,
8 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported being
threatened or injured with a weapon in the previous
12 months, and 22 percent reported that illegal drugs
were made available to them on school property
(Indicators 4 and 9). The following section presents
key findings from each section of the report.

ʺʺ

More students ages 12–18 were victims of theft at
school than away from school in 2006 (Indicator
2). In 2006, 34 thefts per 1,000 students
occurred at school compared to 25 thefts per
1,000 students that occurred away from school.4

ʺʺ

In 2007, 4 percent of students ages 12–18
reported being victimized at school during the
previous 6 months: 3 percent reported theft,4
and 2 percent reported violent victimization5
(Indicator 3). Less than half of a percent of
students reported serious violent victimization.6

ʺʺ

In 2007, 10 percent of male students in grades
9–12 reported being threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property in the past
year, compared to 5 percent of female students
(Indicator 4).

ʺʺ

Higher percentages of Black students (10 percent)
and Hispanic students (9 percent) reported
being threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property than White students (7 percent)
and American Indian/Alaska Native students
(6 percent) (Indicator 4).

ʺʺ

In the 2003–04 school year, a greater percentage of
teachers in city schools reported being threatened
with injury or physically attacked than teachers
in suburban, town, or rural schools (Indicator 5).
In city schools, 10 percent of teachers were
threatened with injury by students, compared
to 6 percent of teachers in suburban schools,
5 percent of teachers in town schools, and
5 percent of teachers in rural schools.

ʺʺ

A greater percentage of secondary school teachers
(8 percent) reported being threatened with injury
by a student than elementary school teachers
(6 percent) (Indicator 5). However, a greater
percentage of elementary school teachers (4
percent) reported having been physically attacked
than secondary school teachers (2 percent).

ʺʺ

A greater percentage of public than private school
teachers reported being threatened with injury
(7 vs. 2 percent) or physically attacked (4 vs.
2 percent) by students in school (Indicator 5).
Among teachers in city schools, generally, there
were at least five times as many public school
teachers as private school teachers who reported
being threatened with injury (12 vs. 2 percent),
and at least four times as many public school

Violent Deaths

ʺʺ

From July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007, there
were 27 homicides and 8 suicides of school-age
youth (ages 5–18) at school (Indicator 1), or about
1 homicide or suicide of a school-age youth at
school per 1.6 million students enrolled during
the 2006–07 school year.

Nonfatal Student and Teacher
Victimization

ʺʺ

In 2006, students ages 12–18 were victims
of about 1.7 million nonfatal crimes at
school, including thefts4 and violent crimes5
(Indicator 2).

2

School-associated violent death is defined as “a homicide,
suicide, legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), or unintentional firearm-related death in which the fatal
injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary
or secondary school in the United States.” Victims of schoolassociated violent deaths included students, staff members,
and others who are not students.
3
See appendix B for a detailed definition of “at school.”
4
Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts except motor vehicle thefts.
Theft does not include robbery in which threat or use of
force is involved.
5
Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and simple
assault.
6
Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery,
and aggravated assault.

ʺʺ

In 2007, 23 percent of students ages 12–18
reported that there were gangs at their schools
(Indicator 8). Overall, a smaller percentage of
White students (16 percent) and Asian students
(17 percent) reported a gang presence at school
than Black students (38 percent) and Hispanic
students (36 percent).

ʺʺ

In 2007, 22 percent of all students in grades 9–12
reported that someone had offered, sold, or given
them an illegal drug on school property in the
past 12 months (Indicator 9).

ʺʺ

Ten percent of students ages 12–18 reported
that someone at school had used hate-related
words against them, and more than one-third
(35 percent) reported seeing hate-related graffiti
at school in 2007 (Indicator 10).

ʺʺ

In 2007, 32 percent of students ages 12–18
reported having been bullied at school during the
school year (Indicator 11). Twenty-one percent of
students said that they had experienced bullying
that consisted of being made fun of; 18 percent
reported being the subject of rumors; 11 percent
said that they were pushed, shoved, tripped, or
spit on; 6 percent said they were threatened with
harm; 5 percent said they were excluded from
activities on purpose; and 4 percent of students
said they were tried to make do things they
did not want to do or that their property was
destroyed on purpose.

ʺʺ

In 2003–04, 35 percent of teachers agreed
or strongly agreed that student misbehavior
interfered with their teaching, and 31 percent
reported that student tardiness and class cutting
interfered with their teaching (Indicator 12).
Seventy-two percent of teachers agreed or strongly
agreed that other teachers at their school enforced
the school rules, and 88 percent reported that the
principal enforced the school rules.

ʺʺ

A higher percentage of elementary school teachers
than secondary school teachers agreed that school
rules were enforced by teachers in their school,
even for students not in their class (Indicator 12).
In 2003–04, 79 percent of elementary teachers
reported that school rules were enforced by other
teachers, compared to 56 percent of secondary
teachers.

School Environment

ʺʺ

ʺʺ

In 2005–06, 86 percent of public schools
reported one or more serious violent incidents,7
violent incidents,8 thefts of items valued at $10
or greater, or other crimes had occurred at their
school, amounting to an estimated 2.2 million
crimes (Indicator 6). This figure translates into
a rate of 46 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled
in 2005–06.
There was a range in the rate of crimes reported by
schools in 2005–06. For example, 46 percent of
schools experienced 20 or more violent incidents
per 1,000 students, compared to 1 percent of
schools that experienced 1 or 2 such incidents
per 1,000 students and 22 percent of schools that
reported zero incidents (Indicator 6).9
In 2005–06, 24 percent of public schools
reported that student bullying was a daily or
weekly problem (Indicator 7). With regard to
other discipline problems occurring at least once
a week, 18 percent of public school principals
reported student acts of disrespect for teachers,
9 percent reported student verbal abuse of
teachers, 3 percent reported daily or weekly
occurrences of racial/ethnic tensions among
students, and 2 percent reported widespread
disorder in classrooms. With regard to other
discipline problems occurring at least once per
school year, 17 percent of principals reported
undesirable gang activities and 4 percent reported
undesirable cult or extremist activities during
2005–06.
In 2005–06, a higher percentage of middle
schools than primary schools reported various
types of discipline problems (Indicator 7). Also,
a higher percentage of middle schools than high
schools reported daily or weekly occurrences of
student bullying and student sexual harassment
of other students.

Serious violent incidents include rape or attempted rape,
sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with
a weapon, threat of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon. Serious violent incidents are
a subset of violent incidents.
8
Violent incidents include serious violent incidents plus
physical attacks or fights without a weapon and threats of
physical attacks without a weapon. Serious violent incidents
are a subset of violent incidents.

Key Findings

Fights, Weapons, and Illegal
Substances

ʺʺ

ʺʺ

In 2007, 36 percent of students in grades 9–12
reported they had been in a fight anywhere,
and 12 percent said they had been in a fight
on school property during the preceding
12 months (Indicator 13). In the same year,
44 percent of males said they had been in a fight
anywhere, compared to 27 percent of females,
and 16 percent of males said they had been in a
fight on school property, compared to 9 percent
of females.
Eighteen percent of students in grades 9–12
in 2007 reported they had carried a weapon10
anywhere, and 6 percent reported they had
carried a weapon on school property during the
previous 30 days (Indicator 14). There were at
least three times as many males as females who
reported carrying a weapon—either anywhere or
on school property—in all survey years. In 2007,
for example, 9 percent of males carried a weapon
on school property, compared to 3 percent of
females, and 29 percent of males carried a weapon
anywhere, compared to 7 percent of females.

ʺʺ

In 2007, 45 percent of students in grades 9–12
reported having consumed at least one drink of
alcohol anywhere, and 4 percent reported having
consumed at least one drink on school property
during the previous 30 days (Indicator 15).

ʺʺ

Twenty percent of students in grades 9–12 in
2007 reported using marijuana anywhere during
the past 30 days, and 4 percent reported using
marijuana on school property during this period
(Indicator 16).

Fear and Avoidance

ʺʺ

10

In 2007, approximately 5 percent of students
ages 12–18 reported that they were afraid of
attack or harm at school, and 3 percent reported
that they were afraid of attack or harm away
from school (Indicator 17). In 2007, smaller
percentages of White students (4 percent) and
Asian students (2 percent) reported being afraid
of attack or harm at school than their Black
(9 percent) and Hispanic (7 percent) peers.

ʺʺ

In 2007, 7 percent of students ages 12–18
reported that they had avoided a school activity
or one or more places in school in the previous
6 months because of fear of attack or harm:
3 percent of students avoided a school activity,
and 6 percent avoided one or more places in
school (Indicator 18).

Discipline, Safety, and Security
Measures

ʺʺ

Forty-eight percent of public schools reported
taking at least one serious disciplinary action
against a student—including suspensions lasting
5 days or more, removals with no services
(i.e., expulsions), and transfers to specialized
schools—for specific offenses during the
2005–06 school year (Indicator 19). Of those
serious disciplinary actions, 74 percent were
suspensions for 5 days or more, 5 percent were
expulsions, and 20 percent were transfers to
specialized schools.

ʺʺ

In the 2005–06 school year, 5 percent of public
schools reported performing drug testing on
athletes and 3 percent reported doing so for
students in other extracurricular activities
(Indicator 20). A higher percentage of public high
schools than middle or primary schools reported
performing drug tests on students: 13 percent of
high schools reported performing drug tests on
athletes, compared to 7 percent of middle schools
and 1 percent of primary schools.

ʺʺ

The majority of students ages 12–18 reported
that their school had a student code of conduct
(96 percent) and a requirement that visitors sign
in (94 percent) in 2007 (Indicator 21). Metal
detectors were the least commonly observed
security measure. Ten percent of students
reported the use of metal detectors at their school.

Such as a gun, knife, or club.

Foreword
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2008 provides
the most recent national indicators on school crime
and safety. The information presented in this report
is intended to serve as a reference for policymakers
and practitioners so that they can develop effective programs and policies aimed at violence and
school crime prevention. Accurate information
about the nature, extent, and scope of the problem
being addressed is essential for developing effective
programs and policies.
This is the eleventh edition of Indicators of School
Crime and Safety, a joint publication of the Bureau
of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES). This report provides
detailed statistics to inform the nation about current
aspects of crime and safety in schools.
The 2008 edition of Indicators of School Crime
and Safety includes the most recent available data,
compiled from a number of statistical data sources
supported by the federal government. Such sources
include results from a study of violent deaths in

schools, sponsored by the U.S. Department of
Education and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention; the National Crime Victimization
Survey and School Crime Supplement to the survey,
sponsored by the BJS and NCES, respectively;
the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, sponsored by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the
Schools and Staffing Survey and School Survey on
Crime and Safety, both sponsored by NCES.
The entire report is available on the Internet. The
Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Center
for Education Statistics continue to work together
in order to provide timely and complete data on the
issues of school-related violence and safety.

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2008

1

Introduction
Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for teaching
and learning free of crime and violence. Even though
a smaller percentage of students are victims of a
serious violent crime at school1 than away from school
(Indicators 1 and 2), any instance of crime or violence
at school not only affects the individuals involved but
also may disrupt the educational process and affect
bystanders, the school itself, and the surrounding
community (Henry 2000). For both students and
teachers, victimization at school can have lasting
effects. In addition to experiencing loneliness, depression, and adjustment difficulties (Crick and Bigbee
1998; Crick and Grotpeter 1996; Nansel et al. 2001;
Prinstein, Boergers, and Vernberg 2001; Storch et
al. 2003), victimized children are more prone to
truancy (Ringwalt, Ennett, and Johnson 2003),
poor academic performance (Wei and Williams
2004; MacMillan and Hagan 2004), dropping out of
school (Beauvais et al. 1996; MacMillan and Hagan
2004), and violent behaviors (Nansel et al. 2003).
For teachers, incidents of victimization may lead to
professional disenchantment and even departure from
the profession altogether (Karcher 2002; Smith and
Smith 2006).
For parents, school staff, and policymakers to effectively address school crime, they need an accurate
understanding of the extent, nature, and context
of the problem. However, it is difficult to gauge the
scope of crime and violence in schools given the large
amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of
extreme school violence. Measuring progress toward
safer schools requires establishing good indicators of
the current state of school crime and safety across
the nation and regularly updating and monitoring
these indicators; this is the aim of Indicators of School
Crime and Safety.

Purpose and Organization of This
Report
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2008 is the
eleventh in a series of reports produced since 1998
by the National Center for Education Statistics
(NCES) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) that
present the most recent data available on school crime
and student safety. The report is not intended to be
an exhaustive compilation of school crime and safety
information, nor does it attempt to explore reasons for
crime and violence in schools. Rather, it is designed
to provide a brief summary of information from an
1

See appendix B for a detailed definition of “at school.”

Introduction

array of data sources and to make data on national
school crime and safety accessible to policymakers,
educators, parents, and the general public.
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2008 is
organized into sections that delineate specific
concerns to readers, starting with a description of the
most serious violent crimes. The sections cover Violent
Deaths; Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization;
School Environment; Fights, Weapons, and Illegal
Substances; Fear and Avoidance; and Discipline,
Safety, and Security Measures. Each section contains
a set of indicators that, taken together, aim to describe
a distinct aspect of school crime and safety. Where
available, data on crimes that occur outside of school
grounds are offered as a point of comparison. 2
Supplemental tables for each indicator provide more
detailed breakouts and standard errors for estimates.
A glossary of terms and a reference section appear at
the end of the report. Standard errors for the estimate
tables are available online.
This year’s report contains updated data for 15
indicators: violent deaths (Indicator 1), nonfatal
student victimization (Indicator 2), the prevalence
of victimization at school (Indicator 3), threats and
injuries with weapons on school property (Indicator
4), students’ reports of gangs at school (Indicator
8), students’ reports of drug availability on school
property (Indicator 9), students’ reports of being
called hate-related words and seeing hate-related
graffiti (Indicator 10), bullying at school and cyberbullying anywhere (Indicator 11), physical fights on
school property and anywhere (Indicator 13), students
carrying weapons on school property and anywhere
(Indicator 14), students’ use of alcohol on school
property and anywhere (Indicator 15), students’
use of marijuana on school property and anywhere
(Indicator 16 ), students’ perceptions of personal
safety at school and away from school (Indicator
17), students’ reports of avoiding school activities or
specific places in school (Indicator 18), and students’
reports of safety and security measures observed at
school (Indicator 21). In addition, two new tables on
violent and other crime incidents at school and those
reported to the police by the number of incidents have
been added to Indicator 6.

Data in this report are not adjusted to reflect the number
of hours that youths spend on school property versus the
number of hours they spend elsewhere.

Also found in this year’s report are references to recent
publications relevant to each indicator that the reader
may want to consult for additional information or
analyses. These references can be found in the “For
more information” sidebars at the bottom of each
indicator.

Data
The indicators in this report are based on information
drawn from a variety of independent data sources,
including national surveys of students, teachers, and
principals and universe data collections from federal
departments and agencies, including BJS, NCES, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. Each data source
has an independent sample design, data collection
method, and questionnaire design or is the result of
a universe data collection.
The combination of multiple, independent sources
of data provides a broad perspective on school crime
and safety that could not be achieved through any
single source of information. However, readers should
be cautious when comparing data from different
sources. While every effort has been made to keep key
definitions consistent across indicators, differences in
sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and
question phrasing can all affect the comparability
of results. For example, both Indicators 20 and 21
report data on select security and safety measures
used in schools. Indicator 20 uses data collected
from a survey of principals about safety and security
practices used in their schools during the 2005–06
school year. Indicator 21, however, uses data collected
from 12- through 18-year-olds residing in a sample
of households. These students were asked whether
they observed selected safety and security measures
in their school in 2007, but they may not have known
whether, in fact, the security measure was present.
In addition, different indicators contain various
approaches to the analysis of school crime data and,
therefore, will show different perspectives on school
crime. For example, both Indicators 2 and 3 report
data on theft and violent crime at school based on
the National Crime Victimization Survey and the
School Crime Supplement to that survey, respectively.
While Indicator 2 examines the number of incidents
of crime, Indicator 3 examines the percentage or
prevalence of students who reported victimization.
Figure A provides a summary of some of the variations
in the design and coverage of sample surveys used in
this report.
Several indicators in this report are based on
self-reported survey data. Readers should note that

limitations inherent to self-reported data may affect
estimates (Cantor and Lynch 2000; Addington 2005).
First, unless an interview is “bounded” or a reference
period is established, estimates may include events
that exceed the scope of the specified reference period.
This factor may artificially increase reported incidents
because respondents may recall events outside of the
given reference period. Second, many of the surveys
rely on the respondent to “self-determine” a condition.
This factor allows the respondent to define a situation
based upon his or her own interpretation of whether
the incident was a crime or not. On the other hand,
the same situation may not necessarily be interpreted
in the same way by a bystander or the perceived
offender. Third, victim surveys tend to emphasize
crime events as incidents that take place at one point
in time. However, victims can often experience a
state of victimization in which they are threatened or
victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally, respondents
may recall an event inaccurately. For instance, people
may forget the event entirely or recall the specifics
of the episode incorrectly. These and other factors
may affect the precision of the estimates based on
these surveys.
Data trends are discussed in this report when possible.
Where trends are not discussed, either the data are
not available in earlier surveys or the wording of the
survey question changed from year to year, eliminating the ability to discuss any trend. For example,
in Indicator 11, which reports on bullying using data
from the School Crime Supplement survey, the 2007
questionnaire was revised to include information on
cyber-bullying. Due to this change, the text of this
indicator is no longer presenting trend information.
For Indicator 2, due to changes in survey methodology in the 2006 National Crime Victimization
Survey that mainly affected rural areas, national-level
estimates were not comparable to estimates based on
data from previous years. For Indicators 3, 8, 10, 17,
and 18, due to changes in survey methodology in the
2007 School Crime Supplement data file that mainly
affected rural areas, estimates for urbanicity were
suppressed on the data file. For more information on
the National Crime Victimization Survey and School
Crime Supplement, please see appendix A.
Where data from samples are reported, as is the
case with most of the indicators in this report, the
standard error is calculated for each estimate provided
in order to determine the “margin of error” for these
estimates. The standard errors of the estimates for
different subpopulations in an indicator can vary
considerably and should be taken into account when
making comparisons. Throughout this report, in cases
where the standard error was at least 30 percent of the
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2008

associated estimate, the estimates were noted with a “!”
symbol (interpret data with caution). In cases where
the standard error was greater than 50 percent of the
associated estimate, the estimate was suppressed. See
appendix A for more information.
The comparisons in the text have been tested for
statistical significance to ensure that the differences
are larger than might be expected due to sampling
variation. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited
in the report are statistically significant at the .05 level.
Several test procedures were used, depending upon
the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the
statement being tested. The primary test procedure
used in this report was Student’s t statistic, which
tests the difference between two sample estimates.
Linear trend tests were used when differences among
percentages were examined relative to interval
categories of a variable, rather than the differences
between two discrete categories. This test allows one
to examine whether, for example, the percentage
of students who reported using drugs increased (or

decreased) over time or whether the percentage of
students who reported being physically attacked
in school increased (or decreased) with age. When
differences among percentages were examined relative
to a variable with ordinal categories (such as grade),
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a
linear relationship between the two variables.
Although percentages reported in the tables are generally rounded to one decimal place (e.g., 76.5 percent),
percentages reported in the text and figures are
generally rounded from the original number to whole
numbers (with any value of 0.50 or above rounded
to the next highest whole number). While the data
labels on the figures have been rounded to whole
numbers, the graphical presentation of these data
is based on the unrounded estimates shown in the
corresponding table.
Appendix A of this report contains descriptions of all
the datasets used in this report and a discussion of how
standard errors were calculated for each estimate.

Indicator 1
Violent Deaths at School and Away From School
The percentage of youth homicides occurring at school remained at less than 2 percent of the total number
of youth homicides over all available survey years even though the absolute number of homicides of schoolage youth at school varied to some degree across the years.
Violent deaths at schools are rare but tragic events
with far-reaching effects on the school population and
surrounding community. From July 1, 2006, through
June 30, 2007, there were 55 school-associated violent
deaths in elementary and secondary schools in the
United States (tables 1.1 and 1.2).3 In this indicator,
a school-associated violent death is defined as “a
homicide, suicide, legal intervention (involving a law
enforcement officer), or unintentional firearm-related
death in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus
of a functioning elementary or secondary school in
the United States.” Victims of school-associated
violent deaths include students, staff members, and
others who are not students. School-associated violent
deaths include violent deaths that occurred while the
victim was on the way to or returning from regular
sessions at school, or while the victim was attending
or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored
event. At-school and away-from-school homicide and
suicide data were drawn from a number of sources.
Data for school-associated violent deaths for the
2006–07 school year are preliminary. Data for total
suicides are available for 2005 and total homicides
are available for 2005–06.4
The most recent data available for the total number of
homicides of school-age youth are from the 2005–06
school year (figure 1.1 and table 1.1), during which
there were 1,646 homicides. In the 2005 calendar
3

Between July 1, 2006, and June 30, 2007, there were 55 student, staff, and nonstudent school-associated violent deaths,
including 40 homicides, 12 suicides, 2 legal interventions,
and 1 unintentional firearm-related death (table 1.2).
4
Data on total suicides are available only by calendar year,
whereas data on suicides and homicides at school and total
homicides are available by school year. Due to these differences in reference periods, please use caution when comparing violent deaths at school to total violent deaths. Data for
total suicides (2006) and total homicides (2006–2007) are
not yet available.

year, there were 1,408 suicides of school-age youth.
From July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007, there were
27 homicides and 8 suicides of school-age youth (ages
5–18) at school (figure 1.2 and table 1.1). In each year
during the period 1992–93 to 2005–06, there were
generally at least 50 times as many murders of youth
away from school than at school and generally at
least 140 times as many suicides of youth away from
school than at school.4 During the 2006–07 school
year, there were approximately one homicide or suicide of a school-age youth at school per 1.6 million
students enrolled.5
Between July 1, 1992, and June 30, 1999, no
consistent pattern of increase or decrease was observed
in the number of homicides at school (figure 1.2
and table 1.1). During this period, between 28 and
34 homicides of school-age youth occurred at school
in each school year. The number of homicides of
school-age youth at school was lower during the
1999–2000 school year than during the 1998–1999
school year (13 vs. 33 homicides). The number of
homicides of school-age youth at school increased
from 14 to 22 between the 2000–01 and 2003–04
school years, and then declined to 19 by the 2005–06
school year. In 2006–07, the number of homicides
of school-age youth was 27. The percentage of youth
homicides occurring at school remained at less than
2 percent of the total number of youth homicides over
all available survey years even though the absolute
number of homicides of school-age youth at school
varied to some degree across the years. Between the
1992–93 and 2006–07 school years, from 1 to 9
school-age youth committed suicide at school each
year, with no consistent pattern of increase or decrease
in the number of suicides.
5

The total number of students enrolled in prekindergarten
through 12th grade during the 2006–07 school year was
55,394,000 (U.S. Department of Education 2009).

This indicator has been updated to include 2006–07 data. For more information: Tables 1.1 and 1.2 and Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (2008a).

This number approximates the number of suicides away from school. Use caution when interpreting this number due to timeline differences.	
NOTE: “At school” includes on school property, on the way to or from regular sessions at school, and while attending or traveling to or from a schoolsponsored event. Due to missing data for suicides and homicides for the 2006–07 school year, this figure contains data for the 2005–06 school year.

Indicator 2
Incidence of Victimization at School and Away From School
In 2006, the rate for serious violent crime was lower at school than away from school, while the rate for theft
was higher at school than away from school. There was no measurable difference between the victimization
rates for violent crime at school and away from school.
Theft and violence both at school and while going
to and from school can lead to a disruptive and
threatening environment, physical injury, emotional
stress, and can be an obstacle to student achievement
(MacMillan and Hagan 2004; Elliot, Hamburg, and
Williams 1998). In 2006, data from the National
Crime Victimization Survey6 showed that students
ages 12–18 were victims of about 1.7 million nonfatal
crimes (theft7 plus violent crime8) while they were at
school9 and about 1.3 million nonfatal crimes while
they were away from school in 2006 (table 2.1).10,11
These figures represent total crime victimization
rates of 63 crimes per 1,000 students at school, and
49 crimes per 1,000 students away from school
(table 2.1).
In 2006, students were victims of 909,500 crimes
of theft at school and 659,400 crimes of theft away
from school. This translates into 34 thefts per
6

Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on similar
topics, the survey sources for these two indicators differ with
respect to time coverage and administration. For more information on these two surveys, please see appendix A.
7
Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all
burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and
completed thefts except motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not
include robbery in which threat or use of force is involved.
8
Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and simple
assault.
9
“At school” includes inside the school building, on school
property, or on the way to or from school.
10
Due to changes in survey methodology in 2006 that
mainly affected rural areas, 2006 estimates are not comparable to estimates based on NCVS data from previous years.
For more information, please see appendix A.
11
“Students” refers to youth ages 12–18 whose educational
attainment did not exceed grade 12 at the time of the survey.
An uncertain percentage of these persons may not have
attended school during the survey reference period. These
data do not take into account the number of hours that
students spend at school or away from school.

1,000 students at school, compared to 25 thefts
per 1,000 students away from school. There was no
measurable difference between the victimization rates
for violent crime at school and away from school. At
school there were 29 violent crimes per 1,000 students.
Away from school, there were 24 violent crimes per
1,000 students. The rate for serious violent crime12
was lower at school than away from school in 2006.
Students age 12–18 were victims of 6 serious violent
crimes per 1,000 students at school, compared to
11 serious violent crimes per 1,000 students away
from school.
The victimization rates for students ages 12–18 varied
according to certain student characteristics in 2006.
A greater rate of older students (ages 15–18) than
younger students (ages 12–14) were victims of crime
away from school (figures 2.1 and 2.2 and tables 2.2
and 2.3). No measurable difference was found by age
when it came to victimization at school.
Students living in households with incomes of $75,000
or more had a lower rate of total crime victimization
at school than students living in households with
incomes of $49,999 or less. They also had a lower
rate of total crime victimization away from school
than students living in households with incomes
of $74,999 or less. Though there was generally no
measurable difference between students living in
households with different income levels when it came
to rates of theft at or away from school, significant
differences were seen when looking at violent crime
experienced at or away from school. Students living
in households with incomes of $75,000 or more had a
lower rate of violent crime victimization at school and
away from school than students living in households
with incomes of $49,999 or less.
12

Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery,
and aggravated assault.

This indicator has been updated to include 2006 data. For more information: Tables 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3; Eaton et al. (2007); and
MacMillan and Hagan (2004).

Indicator 3
Prevalence of Victimization at School
In 2007, 4 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being victimized at school during the previous
6 months. About 3 percent of students reported theft, 2 percent reported violent victimization, and less than
half of a percent reported serious violent victimization.
Theft is the most frequent type of nonfatal
victimization in the United States (U.S. Department
of Justice 2007). Data from the School Crime
Supplement13,14 show the percentage of students
ages 12–18 who reported criminal victimization
at school15 during the previous 6 months. In 2007,
4 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being
victimized at school during the previous 6 months.
About 3 percent of students reported theft,16 2 percent
reported violent victimization17 (figure 3.1 and table
3.1), and less than half of a percent reported serious
violent victimization.18
In 2007, the prevalence of victimization varied
somewhat according to student characteristics. For

In 2005 and 2007, the unit response rate for the SCS
survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore,
interpret the data with caution. For more information, please
see appendix A.

“At school” includes the school building, on school
property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to
and from school.
16
Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all
burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and
completed thefts except motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not
include robbery in which threat or use of force is involved.
17
Violent victimization includes serious violent crimes and
simple assault.
18
Serious violent victimization includes rape, sexual assault,
robbery, and aggravated assault.

all types of victimization, no measurable differences
were detected by sex in the likelihood of reporting
victimization. The percentage of students reporting
victimization was higher for students in the 7th or 9th
grade than for students in the 12th grade; however,
no other measurable differences in the percentages
reporting victimization were found across grades. In
2007, no measurable differences were detected in the
percentages of White, Black, or Hispanic students who
reported victimization, theft, or violent victimization.
However, a higher percentage of students of other
races/ethnicities than Hispanic students reported
victimization, and a higher percentage of students
of other races/ethnicities than White or Hispanic
students reported violent victimization.
Some differences were also seen by school sector in the
prevalence of victimization reported in 2007. A higher
percentage of students in public schools reported
victimization (5 percent) and theft (3 percent) than
students in private schools (1 percent each).
Overall, the percentage of students ages 12–18
who were victimized at school decreased between
1995 and 2005 from 10 to 4 percent. For each
type of victimization, the percentage of students
reporting victimization decreased between 1995
and 2005. Between the most recent survey years
(2005 and 2007), there were no measurable changes

Serious violent crimes are also included in violent crimes.								
NOTE: Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and completed thefts except motor
vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which threat or use of force is involved. Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery,
and aggravated assault. Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and simple assault. Total crimes include violent crimes and theft. “At school”
includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. In 2005 and 2007, the unit
response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. For more information, please see
appendix A. Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on similar topics, the survey sources for these two indicators differ with respect to
time coverage and administration. For more information on these two surveys, please see appendix A. Estimates were revised and may differ from
previously published data.

Indicator 4
Threats and Injuries With Weapons on School Property
The percentage of students who were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property has fluctuated
between 7 and 9 percent in all survey years from 1993 through 2007.
Every year, some students are threatened or injured
with a weapon while they are on school property.19
The percentage of students victimized in this way
provides an important measure of how safe our
schools are, and how school safety has changed
over time. In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey,
students in grades 9–12 were asked whether they
had been threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property during the 12 months preceding the
survey. In 2007, 8 percent of students reported being
threatened or injured with a weapon, such as a gun,
knife, or club, on school property (table 4.1). From
1993 through 2007, the percentage of students who
were threatened or injured with a weapon fluctuated
between 7 and 9 percent.
The likelihood of being threatened or injured with
a weapon on school property varied by student
characteristics, including sex and grade level. In
each survey year, a higher percentage of males than
females reported being threatened or injured with
a weapon on school property (figure 4.1 and table
4.1). In 2007, the percentage of male students who
reported being threatened or injured in the past
year was nearly twice as high as the percentage of
female students (10 vs. 5 percent). Generally, the
percentages of 9th- and 10th-graders who reported
being threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property were higher than the percentages of
11th- and 12th-graders (figure 4.2 and table 4.1).

For example, in 2007, 9 percent of 9th-graders and
8 percent of 10th-graders reported that they were
threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property, compared with 7 percent of 11th-graders
and 6 percent of 12th-graders.
The percentage of students who reported being
threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property varied by race/ethnicity in 2007. Higher
percentages of students of more than one race
(13 percent), Black students (10 percent), and
Hispanic students (9 percent) reported being
threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property than White students (7 percent). Higher
percentages of all of these groups, except for White
students, also reported being threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property than did American
Indian/Alaska Native students (6 percent). However,
no other measurable differences were found by race/
ethnicity in the percentages of students who reported
being threatened or injured in this way.
In 2007, student reports of being threatened or
injured with a weapon on school property varied
among the 39 states and the District of Columbia for
which data were available. Among these states and
the District of Columbia, the percentage of students
who reported being threatened or injured on school
property ranged from 5 percent in Massachusetts and
North Dakota to 11 percent in Arizona, the District
of Columbia, and Utah (table 4.2).

Teachers Threatened With Injury or Physically Attacked by Students
In the 2003–04 school year, a greater percentage of public school teachers in city schools than their peers
in suburban, town, or rural schools reported being threatened with injury or physically attacked.
Students are not the only victims of intimidation
or violence in schools. Teachers are also subject to
threats and physical attacks, and students from their
schools sometimes commit these offenses. In the
Schools and Staffing Survey, teachers were asked
whether they had been threatened with injury or
physically attacked by a student from their school
in the previous 12 months. A smaller percentage of
teachers, 7 percent, were threatened with injury by
a student from their school in the 2003–04 school
year than in 1993–94 and 1999–2000 school years,
12 and 9 percent respectively (figure 5.1 and table
5.1). A smaller percentage of teachers reported being
physically attacked in 2003–04, 3 percent, than in
1993–94, 4 percent (table 5.2).
A greater percentage of teachers in city schools
reported being threatened with injury or physically
attacked in 2003–04 than teachers in suburban, town,
or rural schools (figure 5.2 and tables 5.1 and 5.2).
For example, in 2003–04, 10 percent of teachers in
city schools were threatened with injury by students,
compared to 6 percent of teachers in suburban
schools, 5 percent of teachers in town schools, and
5 percent of teachers in rural schools. Five percent
of teachers in city schools were physically attacked
by students, compared to 3 percent of teachers in
suburban schools, 3 percent of teachers in town
schools, and 2 percent of teachers in rural schools.
A greater percentage of teachers in suburban schools
reported being threatened with injury or physically
attacked than teachers in rural schools.
In the 2003–04 school year, teachers’ reports of
being threatened or physically attacked by students
varied according to the level of their school. A greater

percentage of secondary school teachers, 8 percent,
reported being threatened with injury by a student
than elementary school teachers, 6 percent (table 5.1).
However, a greater percentage of elementary school
teachers, 4 percent, reported having been physically
attacked than secondary school teachers, 2 percent
(table 5.2). Generally, a greater percentage of elementary and secondary teachers in city schools reported
being threatened with injury or physically attacked
than elementary or secondary teachers in suburban,
town, or rural schools (figure 5.2). For example, in
the 2003–04 school year, 12 percent of secondary
teachers in city schools reported being threatened
with injury compared to 7 percent of secondary
suburban school teachers, and 6 percent of town and
rural secondary school teachers.
A greater percentage of public than private school
teachers reported being threatened with injury
(7 vs. 2 percent) or physically attacked (4 vs. 2
percent) by students in school (tables 5.1 and 5.2).
Among teachers in city schools, generally, there were
at least five times as many public school teachers as
private school teachers who reported being threatened
with injury (12 vs. 2 percent) and at least four times
as many public school teachers as private school
teachers who reported being physically attacked
(5 vs. 1 percent).
Public school teachers’ reports of being threatened
with injury or physically attacked varied among states.
In 2003–04, the percentage of public school teachers who reported being threatened in the previous
12 months ranged from 4 to 18 percent (table 5.3),
and the percentage who were physically attacked
ranged from 1 to 7 percent (table 5.4).

This indicator repeats information from the 2007 Indicators of School Crime and Safety report. For more information: Tables 5.1,
5.2, 5.3, and 5.4, appendix B for definitions of school levels and urbanicity codes, and Strizek et al. (2006).

Indicator 6
Violent and Other Crime Incidents at Public Schools and Those
Reported to the Police
In 2005–06, 78 percent of public schools experienced one or more violent incidents of crime,
17 percent experienced one or more serious violent incidents, 46 percent experienced one or more thefts,
and 68 percent experienced another type of crime.
This indicator20 presents the percentage of public
schools that experienced one or more specified
crimes, the total number of these crimes reported by
schools, and the rate of crimes per 1,000 students.
These data are also presented for the crimes that
were reported to the police. In the School Survey on
Crime and Safety, public school principals were asked
to provide the number of serious violent incidents,21
violent incidents,22 thefts of items valued at $10 or
greater without personal confrontation, and other
incidents23 that occurred at their school,24 as well

as the number of these incidents reported to the
police. During the 2005–06 school year, 86 percent
of public schools reported that one or more incidents
of these crimes had taken place, amounting to an
estimated 2.2 million crimes (figure 6.1 and table
6.1). This figure translates into a rate of 46 crimes
per 1,000 students enrolled in 2005–06. During
the same year, 61 percent of schools reported an
incident of one of the specified crimes to the police,
amounting to about 763,000 crimes—or 16 crimes
per 1,000 students enrolled.

20

In 2005–06, 78 percent of schools experienced
one or more violent incidents of crime, 17 percent
experienced one or more serious violent incidents,
46 percent experienced one or more thefts, and
68 percent experienced one or more other incidents.
Thirty-eight percent of public schools reported
at least one violent incident to police, 13 percent
reported at least one serious violent incident to police,
28 percent reported at least one theft to police, and
51 percent reported one or more of the other incidents
to police.

Indicator was revised on November 23, 2009.
Serious violent incidents include rape or attempted rape,
sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with a
weapon, threat of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery
with or without a weapon.
22
Violent incidents include serious violent incidents plus
physical attacks or fights without a weapon and threats of
physical attacks without a weapon.
23
Other incidents include possession of a firearm or explosive
device; possession of a knife or sharp object; distribution,
possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol; and vandalism.
24
“At school” was defined for respondents to include
activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds,
on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored
events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include
incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school
hours or when school activities or events were in session.

The percentage of public schools with incidents of
crime was lower in 2005–06 than in 2003–04. In
2003–04, 89 percent of schools experienced crimes,
compared to 86 percent of schools in 2005–06 (figure
6.3 and table 6.1). The percentage of schools with
crimes in 2005–06 was not measurably different from
the percentage of schools with crimes in 1999–2000.
The percentage of public schools that reported
crimes to the police followed a similar pattern. In
1999–2000, 62 percent of schools reported crimes to
the police; in 2003–04, 65 percent of schools reported
crimes to the police; and, in 2005–06, 61 percent of
schools did so.
There was a range in the rate of crimes reported by schools in 2005 – 06. For example, 46
percent of schools experienced 20 or more violent
incidents per 1,000 students compared to 1 percent that experienced 1 or 2 such incidents per
1,000 students and 22 percent that reported zero
incidents (figure 6.2 and table 6.4). Although
83 percent of schools reported zero incidents of serious
violent crime, about 2 percent experienced 1 serious violent incident per 1,000 students, 4 percent experienced
2 serious violent incidents per 1,000 students, 6 percent experienced 3 to 5 serious violent incidents per
1,000 students, 2 percent experienced 6 to 9 serious
violent incidents per 1,000 students, and 3 percent
experienced 10 or more such incidents per 1,000 students (figure 6.2 and table 6.5). Similarly, there also
was a substantial range in the number of incidents

22

School Environment

reported to the police. For example, 62 percent of
schools reported zero incidents of violent crime to
the police compared to 5 percent that reported 1 or
2 violent incidents per 1,000 students and 9 percent
that reported 20 or more such incidents per 1,000
students (figure 6.2 and table 6.4).
The percentage of schools that experienced violent
crime also varied by school characteristic and
number of incidents. A larger percentage of city
schools (53 percent) reported 20 or more violent
incidents per 1,000 students than urban fringe
schools (42 percent) and rural schools (43 percent).
There was no measurable difference in the percentage
of city schools and town schools that experienced
20 or more violent incidents per 1,000 students in
2005–06.
As the percentage of students eligible for free or
reduced-price lunch increased, so did the percentage
of schools reporting experiencing 20 or more violent
incidents per 1,000 students. In 2005–06, 55 percent
of schools where more than 50 percent of the students
were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch experienced
20 or more violent incidents per 1,000 students
compared to 29 percent of schools where 20 percent
or less of the students were eligible for free or reducedprice lunch. The percentage of students eligible for free
or reduced-price lunch programs is a proxy measure
of school poverty.

Indicator 7
Discipline Problems Reported by Public Schools
Between 1999–2000 and 2005–06, the percentage of principals reporting student bullying as a frequently
occurring discipline problem declined from 29 to 24 percent and student verbal abuse of teachers declined
from 13 to 9 percent.
The existence of discipline problems in a school
may contribute to an environment that facilitates
school violence and crime. In the School Survey
on Crime and Safety, school principals were asked
how often certain disciplinary problems happen in
their schools.25 This indicator examines the daily or
weekly occurrence of student racial tensions, bullying,
sexual harassment of other students, verbal abuse of
teachers, widespread classroom disorder, and acts of
disrespect for teachers in public schools. It also looks
at occurrences of undesirable gang and cult activities,
and due to the severe nature of these incidents,
presents all reports of gang and cult activities during
the school year.
Twenty-four percent of public schools reported that
bullying occurred among students on a daily or
weekly basis and 18 percent reported that student
acts of disrespect for teachers took place on a daily
or weekly basis during the 2005–06 school year
(figure 7.1 and table 7.1). With regard to other
frequently occurring discipline problems in public
schools (those occurring at least once a week),
9 percent of principals reported student verbal
abuse of teachers, 3 percent reported student sexual
harassment of other students, 3 percent reported
student racial/ethnic tensions, and 2 percent reported
widespread disorder in classrooms. Seventeen percent
of public schools reported that undesirable gang
activities and 4 percent reported that undesirable
cult or extremist activities had happened at all during
2005–06. The percentage of principals reporting that
student bullying and student verbal abuse of teachers
occurred at least once a week declined between
25

“At school” was defined for respondents to include
activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds,
on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored
events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include
incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school
hours or when school activities or events were in session.

1999–2000 and 2005–06 (table 7.1). During this
period, the percentage of principals reporting student
bullying as a frequently occurring discipline problem
declined from 29 to 24 percent and student verbal
abuse of teachers declined from 13 to 9 percent.
Discipline problems reported by public schools varied
by school characteristics in 2005–06. In general,
the percentage of principals reporting discipline
problems was higher in large schools than in small
schools (figure 7.1 and table 7.2). For example,
35 percent of principals at schools with 1,000 or
more students reported that student acts of disrespect
for teachers occurred at least once a week, whereas
12 percent at schools with less than 300 students
reported this discipline problem. Also, in 2005–06,
a higher percentage of middle schools than primary
schools reported various types of discipline problems.
Also, a higher percentage of middle schools than
high schools reported daily or weekly occurrences
of student bullying and student sexual harassment
of other students.
In 2005–06, the percentage of schools reporting the
discipline problems of widespread disorder in the
classroom, student acts of disrespect for teachers,
student verbal abuse of teachers, and undesirable
gang activities was generally smaller for schools where
20 percent or fewer of the students were eligible for
free or reduced-price lunch than for schools where
more than 50 percent of the students were eligible
(table 7.2). For example, 14 percent of schools where
more than 50 percent of the students were eligible
for free or reduced-price lunch reported the daily or
weekly occurrence of student verbal abuse of teachers
compared to 3 percent of schools where 20 percent
or fewer of the students were eligible. The percentage
of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch
programs is a proxy measure of school poverty.

This indicator repeats information from the 2007 Indicators of School Crime and Safety report. For more information: Tables 7.1
and 7.2; appendix B for definitions of school levels; and Nolle, Guerino, and Dinkes (2007).

Indicator 8
Students’ Reports of Gangs at School
In 2007, about 23 percent of students reported that gangs were present at their school.
Gangs are organized groups often involved in drugs,
weapons trafficking, and violence. Gangs at school
can be disruptive to the school environment because
their presence may incite fear among students and
increase the level of school violence (Laub and
Lauritsen 1998). In the School Crime Supplement 26
to the National Crime Victimization Survey,
students ages 12–18 were asked if gangs were present
at their school.27
In 2007, 23 percent of students reported that there
were gangs at their schools during the school year
(figure 8.1 and table 8.1). During the same year, a
greater percentage of male students (25 percent) than
female students (21 percent) reported a gang presence
at their schools. Overall, a smaller percentage of
White students (16 percent) and Asian students
(17 percent) reported a gang presence at school than
Black students (38 percent) and Hispanic students
(36 percent) in 2007.

Generally, a smaller percentage of 6th-, 7th-, and
8th-graders reported a gang presence at their school
than 9th-, 10th-, 11th-, and 12th-graders. In 2007,
between 15 and 21 percent of 6th-, 7th-, and 8thgraders reported a gang presence at school compared
to 24 to 28 percent of students in the higher grades.
In 2007, a higher percentage of students attending
public schools (25 percent) reported a gang presence
at school than students attending private schools
(5 percent).
The total percentage of students who reported the
presence of gangs at school was higher in 2005
(24 percent) than in 2003 (21 percent); however
there was no measurable change in the percentage of
students who reported the presence of gangs at school
between the two most recent survey years (2005 and
2007) (figure 8.2 and table 8.1).

26

In 2005 and 2007, the unit response rate for this survey
did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret
the data with caution. In 2007, the reference period was the
school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period
was the previous 6 months. Cognitive testing showed that
estimates from 2007 are comparable to previous years. For
more information, please see appendix A.

“At school” includes the school building, on school
property, on a school bus, or going to and from school.

Students’ Reports of Drug Availability on School Property
A smaller percentage of students reported that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them at school in 2007
(22 percent) than in 2005 (25 percent).
The availability of drugs on school property has a
disruptive and corrupting influence on the school
environment (Nolin et al. 1997). In the Youth Risk
Behavior Survey, students in grades 9–12 were asked
whether someone had offered, sold, or given them
an illegal drug on school property in the 12 months
before the survey.28 The percentage of students in
grades 9–12 who reported that drugs were made
available to them on school property increased
from 1993 to 1995 (from 24 to 32 percent), but
subsequently decreased (to 25 percent in 2005 and
22 percent in 2007) (table 9.1 and figure 9.1). The
percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported
that drugs were made available to them on school
property was lower in 2007 than it was in 2005
(22 vs. 25 percent).
Reports of the availability of drugs on school property
varied by student characteristics. A higher percentage
of males than females reported that drugs were
offered, sold, or given to them on school property
in each survey year from 1993 to 2007 (figure 9.1
and table 9.1). For example, in 2007, 26 percent of
males reported that drugs were available, compared
with 19 percent of females. Some differences in the
percentages of students reporting that drugs were
offered, sold, or given to them on school property
also appeared by grade. In 2007, the percentage of

10th-grade students (25 percent) who reported that
drugs were made available to them was higher than
the percentage for either 9th- or 12th-grade students
(21 and 20 percent, respectively), but not measurably
different from that of 11th-grade students.
The percentages of students who reported having
illegal drugs offered, sold, or given to them on
school property differed across racial/ethnic groups
(figure 9.2 and table 9.1). Specifically, in 2007, higher
percentages of Hispanic and Pacific Islander/Native
Hawaiian students than Black, White, and Asian
students reported that drugs were made available to
them (29 and 38 percent vs. 19–21 percent). Although
it appears that a higher percentage of Pacific Islander/
Native Hawaiian students than Hispanic students
reported that drugs were made available to them, the
difference was not found to be statistically significant.
In 2007, student reports of the availability of drugs
on school property varied among the 39 states and the
District of Columbia for which data were available.
Among these states and the District of Columbia,
the percentage of students reporting that drugs were
offered, sold, or given to them on school property
ranged from 10 percent in Iowa to 37 percent in
Arizona (table 9.2).

Students’ Reports of Being Called Hate-Related Words and Seeing
Hate-Related Graffiti
In 2007, 10 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that someone at school had used hate-related words
against them, and 35 percent had seen hate-related graffiti at school.
In the 2007 School Crime Supplement 29 to the
National Crime Victimization Survey, students
ages 12–18 were asked if someone at school had
called them a derogatory word having to do with
their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, or
sexual orientation at school.30 Students were also
asked if they had seen hate-related graffiti at their
school—that is, hate-related words or symbols
written in classrooms, bathrooms, hallways, or on
the outside of the school building. With regard to
hate-related words, students were asked to specify the
characteristic to which the word was directed.31 In
2007, 10 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that
someone at school had used hate-related words against
them during the school year (figure 10.1 and table
10.1). Thirty-five percent of students reported seeing
hate-related graffiti at school during the school year.
In 2007, students’ experiences of being called
specific types of hate-related words and seeing
hate-related graffiti differed according to student
and school characteristics. For example, a smaller
percentage of 12th-graders (6 percent) reported
29

In 2005 and 2007, the unit response rate for this survey
did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret
the data with caution. In 2007, the reference period was
the school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference
period was the previous 6 months. Cognitive testing showed
that estimates from 2007 are comparable to previous years.
For more information, please see appendix A.
30
 “At school” includes the school building, on school
property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to
and from school.

 “Hate-related” refers to derogatory terms used by others in
reference to students’ personal characteristics.

being targets of a hate-related word than 6th-graders
(12 percent); 7th-graders, 8th-graders, and 9th-graders
(11 percent each); and 10th-graders (9 percent). A
higher percentage of public school students reported
being called a hate-related word and seeing haterelated graffiti than did private school students.
In 2007, 10 percent of public school students
reported being called a hate-related word and
36 percent reported seeing hate-related graffiti
compared to 6 percent of private school students
who reported being called a hate-related word and
19 percent who reported seeing hate-related graffiti.
A higher percentage of White students and students
of other races/ethnicities than Asian students
reported seeing hate-related graffiti. However, no
other measurable differences were found by race/
ethnicity or by sex in the percentages of students
who reported being called hate-related words or
seeing hate-related graffiti.
Between 2001 and 2007, the percentage of students
who reported being the target of a hate-related
word decreased from 12 to 10 percent. Between the
two most recent survey years, 2005 and 2007, the
percentage of students who reported being the target
of a hate-related word was lower in 2007 (10 percent)
than in 2005 (11 percent). There was no pattern of
increase or decrease in the percentage of students who
reported seeing hate-related graffiti between 1999
and 2007. However, the percentage of students who
reported seeing hate-related graffiti was smaller in
2007 (35 percent) than in 2005 (38 percent).

With regard to the specific characteristic to which the
hate-related word was directed, in 2007, 5 percent
of students reported hate-related words concerning
their race, 3 percent reported words related to their
ethnicity, 2 percent each reported words concerning
their religion or gender, and 1 percent each reported
words related to their disability or sexual orientation
(figure 10.2 and table 10.2).
Students’ experiences of being targets of specific types
of hate-related words in 2007 differed according to
their sex and race/ethnicity (table 10.2). A greater
percentage of female students than male students
(3 vs. 1 percent) reported being called a genderrelated hate word. However, a greater percentage
of male students than female students reported

34

being called hate-related words relating to race and
ethnicity. Five percent of male students compared to
4 percent of female students reported being targets
of a hate-related word regarding race and 4 percent
of male students compared to 2 percent of female
students reported being targets of a hate-related word
regarding ethnicity. A smaller percentage of White
students (3 percent) reported being called race-related
hate words than Black students (7 percent), Hispanic
students (6 percent), Asian students (11 percent),
and students from other race/ethnicities (8 percent).
Smaller percentages of both White students and Black
students (2 percent each) reported hate-related words
regarding their ethnicity than Hispanic and Asian
students (7 percent each).

In the School Crime Supplement (SCS) questionnaire, students were asked if they had been the target of hate-related words at school. Students
who indicated that they had been called a hate-related word were asked to choose the specific characteristics that the hate-related word targeted.
Students were allowed to choose more than one characteristic. If a student chose more than one characteristic, he or she is counted once under
the “total” category. Therefore, the total percentage of students who reported being called a hate-related word is less than the sum of the students’
individual characteristics.									
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and going to and from school. Hate-related refers to derogatory
terms used by others in reference to students’ personal characteristics. In 2007, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical
standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. For more information, please see appendix A.

Indicator 11
Bullying at School and Cyber-Bullying Anywhere
In 2007, about 32 percent of 12- to 18-year-old students reported having been bullied at school during
the school year and 4 percent reported having been cyber-bullied.
Both bullying and being bullied at school are
associated with key violence-related behaviors,
including carrying weapons, fighting, and sustaining
injuries from fighting (Nansel et al. 2003). In the
2007 School Crime Supplement32 to the National
Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18
were asked if they had been bullied at school during
the school year.33
In 2007, about 32 percent of students reported having
been bullied at school during the school year (figure
11.1 and table 11.1).34 Twenty-one percent of students
said that they had experienced bullying that consisted
of being made fun of; 18 percent reported being the
subject of rumors; 11 percent said that they were
pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; 6 percent said they
were threatened with harm; 5 percent said they were
excluded from activities on purpose; and 4 percent
each said that someone tried to make them do things
they did not want to do and that their property was
destroyed on purpose (figure 11.2 and table 11.1).
Of those students in 2007 who reported being
bullied during the school year, 79 percent said that
they were bullied inside the school, 23 percent said
that they were bullied outside on school grounds,
8 percent said they were bullied on the school bus,
and 4 percent said they were bullied somewhere
else (figure 11.3 and table 11.2). Nine percent of all
students reported that they had suffered injuries as
a result of being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on.
Of these students who had been bullied, 63 percent
said that they had been bullied once or twice during
the school year, 21 percent had experienced bullying
once or twice a month, 10 percent reported being
bullied once or twice a week, and 7 percent said that
they had been bullied almost daily (figure 11.4 and
32
In 2007, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet
NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with
caution. For more information, please see appendix A.
33
“At school” includes the school building, on school
property, on a school bus, or going to and from school.
34
Bullying includes being made fun of; being the subject of
rumors; being threatened with harm; being pushed, shoved,
tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things did
not want to do; excluded; and having property destroyed
on purpose.

table 11.3). Thirty-six percent of students who were
bullied notified a teacher or another adult at school
about the event(s).
In 2007, about 4 percent of students reported having
been cyber-bullied 35 anywhere (on or off school
property) during the school year (figure 11.1 and
table 11.1). Two percent of students said that they had
experienced cyber-bullying that consisted of another
student posting hurtful information about them
on the Internet; and 2 percent of students reported
unwanted contact, including being threatened or
insulted, via instant messaging by another student
during the school year (figure 11.2 and table 11.1).
Of the students in 2007 who reported cyber-bullying
during the school year, 73 percent said it had occurred
once or twice during that period, 21 percent said it
had occurred once or twice a month, and 5 percent
said it had occurred once or twice a week (figure 11.4
and table 11.3). Thirty percent of students who were
cyber-bullied notified a teacher or another adult at
school about the event(s).
Student reports of bullying and cyber-bullying varied
by student characteristics. A greater percentage of
female than male students reported being bullied
at school and cyber-bullied anywhere during the
school year (figure 11.1 and table 11.1). In 2007,
33 percent of female students reported being bullied
at school compared to 30 percent of male students.
Five percent of female students reported being cyberbullied anywhere compared to 2 percent of male
students. A higher percentage of White students
(34 percent) reported being bullied at school in 2007
than Hispanic students (27 percent). In addition, a
higher percentage of White students (34 percent)
reported being bullied at school than Asian students
(18 percent).
35

Cyber-bullying includes students who responded that
another student posted hurtful information about the
respondent on the Internet; made unwanted contact by
threatening or insulting the respondent via instant messaging;
or made unwanted contact by threatening or insulting the
respondent via text (SMS) messaging. The latter category did
not meet statistical standards to be reported separately.

This indicator has been updated to include 2007 data. For more information: Tables 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3 and DeVoe and
Kaffenberger (2005).

Indicator 12
Teachers’ Reports on School Conditions
The percentage of teachers who reported that student misbehavior, class cutting, and tardiness interfered
with their teaching varied by teacher and school characteristics. A higher percentage of teachers in city schools
than in suburban, rural, or town schools reported that misbehavior and student tardiness interfered with
their teaching in 2003–04.
Classroom disruptions are associated with lower
student achievement for the offending student as
well as for that student’s classmates (Lannie and
McCurdy 2007). In the Schools and Staffing Survey,
public and private school teachers were asked if
student misbehavior and student tardiness and class
cutting interfered with their teaching. In 2003–04,
35 percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that
student misbehavior interfered with their teaching,
and 31 percent reported that student tardiness and
class cutting interfered with their teaching (table
12.1). Teachers were also asked if school rules were
enforced by other teachers at their school, even for
students not in their classes, or by the principal.
Seventy-two percent of teachers agreed or strongly
agreed that other teachers at their school enforced
the school rules and 88 percent reported that the
principal enforced the school rules in 2003–04
(figure 12.1 and table 12.2).
The percentage of teachers who reported that student
misbehavior, class cutting, and tardiness interfered
with their teaching varied by teacher and school
characteristics. In 2003–04, a higher percentage of
teachers in city schools than in suburban, town, or
rural schools reported that misbehavior and student
tardiness interfered with their teaching (table 12.1).
For example, 42 percent of teachers in city schools
reported that student misbehavior in their school
interfered with their teaching, compared to 33
percent of suburban teachers, 34 percent of town
teachers, and 31 percent of rural teachers. Between
1987–88 and 2003–04, a larger percentage of public

school teachers than private school teachers reported
that student misbehavior and tardiness interfered
with their teaching (figure 12.2 and table 12.1). In
2003–04, about 37 percent of public school teachers
reported that student misbehavior interfered with
their teaching, compared to 21 percent of private
school teachers. In 2003–04, a higher percentage of
secondary school teachers than elementary school
teachers agreed that student misbehavior, student
tardiness, and class cutting interfered with their
teaching (table 12.1). In 2003–04, for example,
40 percent of secondary school teachers reported that
student misbehavior interfered with their teaching,
compared to 34 percent of elementary teachers.
The percentage of teachers who agreed that school
rules were enforced by other teachers varied by teacher
and school characteristics. In every survey year, a
higher percentage of elementary school teachers than
secondary school teachers agreed that school rules
were enforced by teachers in their school, even for
students not in their class (table 12.2 and figure 12.1).
In 2003–04, for example, 79 percent of elementary
teachers reported that school rules were enforced by
other teachers compared to 56 percent of secondary
teachers. Generally, the percentage of teachers who
agreed or strongly agreed that school rules were
enforced by other teachers was greater in schools with
smaller school enrollment (table 12.2). In 2003–04,
about 84 percent of teachers in schools with fewer
than 200 students agreed that school rules were
enforced by other teachers, compared to 56 percent
of teachers in schools with 1,000 or more students.

This indicator repeats information from the 2007 Indicators of School Crime and Safety report. For more information: Tables 12.1
and 12.2, appendix B for definitions of school levels and urbanicity codes, and Strizek et al. (2006).

Indicator 13
Physical Fights on School Property and Anywhere
The percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported being in a physical fight on school property decreased
from 16 percent in 1993 to 12 percent in 2007.
Schools where physical fights occur frequently may not
be able to maintain a focused learning environment
for students. Also, students who participate in fights
on school property may have difficulty succeeding in
their studies (Payne, Gottfredson, and Gottfredson
2003). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students
in grades 9–12 were asked about their general
involvement in physical fights (referred to as
“anywhere” in this indicator) during the preceding
12 months, as well as about their involvement in
physical fights on school property.36 Fights occurring
anywhere are included as a point of comparison
with fights occurring on school property. In 2007,
36 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported having
been in a fight anywhere, and 12 percent said they had
been in a fight on school property (figure 13.1 and
table 13.1). The percentage of students who reported
having been in a fight anywhere decreased from
1993 to 2003 (from 42 to 33 percent). From 2003
to 2005, this percentage rose to 36 percent, but no
measurable change was seen between 2005 and 2007.
The percentage of students who reported having been
in a fight on school property declined from 16 percent
in 1993 to 12 percent in 2007.
In all survey years, a higher percentage of males than
females reported having been in a fight both anywhere
and on school property (figure 13.1 and table 13.1).
In 2007, 44 percent of males said they had been in a
fight anywhere, compared with 27 percent of females.
In the same year, 16 percent of males said they had
been in a fight on school property, compared with
9 percent of females. From 1993 through 2003, the
percentage of both males and females who reported
they had been in a fight anywhere decreased. The
percentage of males reporting they had been in a
fight on school property decreased from 1993 to
2007, however, there was no measurable change in
the percentage of females who reported fighting on
school property.
36

“On school property” was not defined for survey
respondents.

Generally, a higher percentage of students in 9th
grade reported having been in fights than students in
11th and 12th grades, both anywhere and on school
property (figure 13.2 and table 13.1). For example,
in 2007, 41 percent of 9th-graders compared with
35 percent of 11th-graders, and 28 percent of 12thgraders reported having been in a fight anywhere.
Similarly, 17 percent of 9th-graders compared with
11 percent of 11th-graders, and 9 percent of 12thgraders reported being in a fight on school property
in 2007.
The percentage of students engaging in fights varied
according to their race/ethnicity in 2007. A smaller
percentage of Asian students than students from
all other racial/ethnic groups reported having been
in a fight anywhere. Twenty-four percent of Asian
students reported being in a fight, compared with
32 to 48 percent of students from other racial/ethnic
groups. In addition, a higher percentage of Black
students and students of more than one race reported
having been in a fight anywhere than their White,
Hispanic, or American Indian/Alaska Native peers.
A lower percentage of Asian and White students
reported having been in a fight on school property
in 2007 than Black students, Hispanic students,
American Indian/Alaska Native students, or students
of more than one race (8 and 10 percent vs. 15 to
20 percent).
In 2007, the percentage of students who reported
having been in a fight anywhere (38 states and
the District of Columbia) and on school property
(39 states and the District of Columbia) varied among
the states and the District of Columbia for which data
were available. Among these states and the District of
Columbia, the percentage of students reporting being
in a fight anywhere ranged from 24 percent in Iowa
to 43 percent in the District of Columbia, while the
percentage of students reporting being in a fight on
school property ranged from 7 percent in Hawaii to
20 percent in the District of Columbia (table 13.2).

This indicator has been updated to include 2007 data. For more information: Tables 13.1 and 13.2 and Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (2008b).

Indicator 14
Students Carrying Weapons on School Property and Anywhere
In 2007, 18 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported they had carried a weapon anywhere in the past
30 days, while 6 percent reported they had carried a weapon on school property.
The presence of weapons at school may interfere with
teaching and learning by creating an intimidating
and threatening atmosphere (Aspy et al. 2004).
In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students were
asked if they had carried a weapon such as a gun,
knife, or club (referred to as “anywhere” in this
indicator) in the past 30 days as well as if they had
carried one of these weapons on school property.37
Weapon carrying anywhere is included as a point
of comparison with weapon carrying on school
property. In 2007, 18 percent of students in grades
9–12 reported they had carried a weapon anywhere,
and 6 percent reported they had carried a weapon on
school property (figure 14.1 and table 14.1).

In 2007, few differences were detected based on
students’ race/ethnicity in the percentage of students
who reported carrying weapons anywhere and on
school property. A smaller percentage of Asian
students (8 percent) than students from other racial/
ethnic groups reported carrying a weapon anywhere,
but no measurable differences were detected
among Black students (17 percent), White students
(18 percent), and Hispanic students (19 percent). A
larger percentage of Hispanic students (7 percent)
than White students (5 percent) and Asian students
(4 percent) reported carrying a weapon during the
previous 30 days on school property in 2007, but no
other differences were detected by race/ethnicity.

The percentage of students who reported carrying
a weapon anywhere declined from 22 to 17 percent
between 1993 and 2003. Subsequently, however,
from 2003 to 2007 there was no measurable change
in the percentage of students who reported carrying
a weapon anywhere. Between 1993 and 2007,
the percentage of students who reported carrying
a weapon on school property declined from 12
to 6 percent; generally, however, the decline was
gradual as no differences were detected survey year
to survey year.

In 2007, 20 percent of 9th-graders reported carrying
a weapon anywhere compared to 15 percent of
12th-graders (figure 14.2 and table 14.1). However,
no differences were detected in the percentage of
students who reported carrying a weapon on school
property by grade level.

In every survey year, generally, there were at least
three times as many males as females who reported
carrying a weapon—either anywhere or on school
property (figure 14.1 and table 14.1). In 2007, for
example, 9 percent of males carried a weapon on
school property, compared to 3 percent of females,
and 29 percent of males carried a weapon anywhere,
compared to 7 percent of females.

In 2007, the percentage of students who reported
carrying a weapon anywhere (36 states and the
District of Columbia) and on school property
(39 states and the District of Columbia) varied among
the states and the District of Columbia for which data
were available. Among these states and the District
of Columbia, the percentage of students reporting
carrying a weapon anywhere ranged from 13 percent
in Iowa to 27 percent in New Mexico, while the
percentage of students reporting carrying a weapon
on school property ranged from 4 percent in Hawaii,
Illinois, Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin to 11 percent in
Wyoming (table 14.2).

“On school property” was not defined for survey
respondents.

Indicator 15
Students’ Use of Alcohol on School Property and Anywhere
In 2007, 45 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported having at least one drink of alcohol anywhere in
the past 30 days, while 4 percent had at least one drink on school property.
Students’ illegal consumption of alcohol on
school property may lead to additional crimes and
misbehavior (Kodjo, Auinger, and Ryan 2003). It
may also foster a school environment that is harmful
to students, teachers, and other staff (Fagan and
Wilkinson 1998). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey,
students in grades 9–12 were asked whether they had
consumed alcohol at all (referred to as “anywhere”
in this indicator) in the past 30 days and if they had
consumed alcohol on school property.38 Alcohol
consumption anywhere is included as a point of
comparison with alcohol consumption on school
property. In 2007, 45 percent of students consumed
at least one drink of alcohol anywhere, and 4 percent
consumed at least one drink on school property
(figure 15.1 and table 15.1).
The percentage of students who reported drinking
alcohol anywhere was higher in 1995 (52 percent)
than in 1993 (48 percent), and declined from 1995
to 2007 to 45 percent. Generally, the percentage of
students who reported consuming alcohol on school
property declined from 6 percent in 1995 to 4 percent
in 2007.
The percentage of students who reported drinking
alcohol anywhere or on school property varied
by student characteristics such as sex, grade level,
and race/ethnicity. In every survey year, a greater
percentage of males than females reported using
alcohol on school property. For example, in 2007,
5 percent of males compared to 4 percent of females
reported using alcohol on school property. However,
since 2003, there has been no measurable difference
in the percentage of males and females who reported
using alcohol anywhere. In 2007, 45 percent of
both males and females reported using alcohol
anywhere.
38

 “On school property” was not defined for survey
respondents.

A larger percentage of students in higher grades than
in lower grades reported drinking alcohol anywhere
in 2007. For example, 55 percent of 12th-graders
reported using alcohol, compared to 36 percent
of 9th-graders, 42 percent of 10th-graders, and
49 percent of 11th-graders (figure 15.2 and table 15.1).
A higher percentage of 12th-graders (5 percent) than
9th-graders (3 percent) reported drinking on school
property; however, no measurable differences were
found among other grade levels.
In 2007, a larger percentage of White and Hispanic
students reported drinking alcohol anywhere than
their Black, Asian, or American Indian/Alaska
Native peers, and a smaller percentage of Asian
students reported drinking alcohol anywhere than
students from other race/ethnicities. Forty-seven
percent of White students and 48 percent of Hispanic
students reported drinking alcohol any where
compared to 35 percent of American Indian/Alaska
Native students, 34 percent of Black students, and
25 percent of Asian students. A greater percentage of
Hispanic students (7 percent) reported using alcohol
on school property in 2007 than White students
(3 percent), Black students (3 percent), Asian students
(4 percent), or American Indian/Alaska Native
students (5 percent).
In 2007, the percentage of students who reported
drinking alcohol anywhere (39 states and the District
of Columbia) and on school property (38 states and
the District of Columbia) varied among the states
and the District of Columbia for which data were
available. Among these states and the District of
Columbia, the percentage of students who reported
drinking alcohol anywhere ranged from 17 percent in
Utah to 49 percent in Wisconsin, while the percentage
of students who reported drinking on school property
ranged from 3 percent in Iowa, Missouri, and Ohio
to 9 percent in New Mexico (table 15.2).

Students’ Use of Marijuana on School Property and Anywhere
In 2007, 20 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported using marijuana anywhere in the past
30 days, while 4 percent reported using marijuana on school property.
In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in
grades 9–12 were asked whether they had used
marijuana at all (referred to as “anywhere” in this
indicator) in the past 30 days as well as whether
they had used marijuana on school property.39 In
2007, 20 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported
using marijuana anywhere in the past 30 days, while
4 percent reported using marijuana on school
property (figure 16.1 and table 16.1).
The percentage of students who reported using
marijuana anywhere was higher in 1995 (25 percent)
than in 1993 (18 percent). During the second half of
the 1990s, there was no measurable change in the
percentage of students who reported using marijuana
anywhere (it ranged from 25 to 27 percent). Between
1999 and 2007, the percentage of students who
reported using marijuana anywhere had declined to
20 percent. However, there was no measurable change
in the percentage of students who reported using
marijuana anywhere between 2005 and 2007.
With regard to marijuana use on school property, the
percentage of students who reported using marijuana
was higher in 1995 (9 percent) than the percentage
who reported doing so in 1993 (6 percent). Between
1995 and 2007, the percentage of students who
reported using marijuana on school property
declined from 9 to 4 percent. The percentage of
students who reported using marijuana on school
property in 2007 was not measurably different from
the percentage of students who reported doing so
in 1993.
Marijuana use anywhere and on school property
varied by students’ sex and grade level. In every
survey year, a greater percentage of males than
females reported using marijuana in the past
30 days, both anywhere and on school property. For
39

 “On school property” was not defined for survey
respondents.

example, in 2007, 22 percent of males reported using
marijuana anywhere in the past 30 days compared to
17 percent of females, and 6 percent of males reported
using marijuana on school property compared to
3 percent of females.
In 2007, a smaller percentage of 9th-grade students
than students in higher grades reported using
marijuana anywhere. In 2007, 15 percent of 9thgrade students reported using marijuana anywhere
compared to 19 percent of 10th-graders, 21 percent
of 11th-graders, and 25 percent of 12th-graders
(figure 16.2 and table 16.1). There were no measurable
differences in student reports of marijuana use on
school property by school level in 2007.
In 2007, a smaller percentage of Asian students
(9 percent) than students from other racial/ethnic
groups (ranging from 18 to 29 percent) reported
using marijuana anywhere. A larger percentage of
American Indian/Alaska Native students (27 percent)
than White students (20 percent), Hispanic students
(18 percent), and Asian students (9 percent) also
reported using marijuana anywhere. At school, there
were generally few differences in the percentage of
students who reported using marijuana by race/
ethnicity in 2007.
In 2007, the percentage of students who reported
using marijuana anywhere (39 states and the District
of Columbia) and on school property (38 states and
the District of Columbia) varied among the states
and the District of Columbia for which data were
available. Among these states and the District of
Columbia, the percentage of students who reported
using marijuana anywhere ranged from 9 percent in
Utah to 25 percent in Delaware, Massachusetts, and
New Mexico, while the percentage of students who
reported using marijuana on school property and
ranged from 2 percent in Iowa to 8 percent in New
Mexico (table 16.2).

Indicator 17
Students’ Perceptions of Personal Safety at School and Away
From School
In 2007, approximately 5 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they were afraid of attack or harm
at school, compared to 3 percent of students who reported that they were afraid of attack or harm away
from school.
School violence can make students fearful and affect
their readiness and ability to learn, and concerns
about vulnerability to attacks detract from a positive
school environment (Scheckner et al. 2002). In the
School Crime Supplement40 to the National Crime
Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked
how often they had been afraid of attack or harm
“at school or on the way to and from school” and
“away from school.”41 In 2007, a greater percentage of
students ages 12–18 reported that they were afraid of
attack or harm at school (5 percent) than away from
school (3 percent) during the school year (figure 17.1
and table 17.1).
Students’ reports on their fears about their safety
varied by location and race/ethnicity. For example,
in 2007, smaller percentages of White students
(4 percent) and Asian students (2 percent) reported
being afraid of attack or harm at school than their
Black (9 percent) and Hispanic (7 percent) peers.
Away from school, a smaller percentage of White
students (3 percent) than Black students (5 percent)
and Hispanic students (6 percent) reported being
afraid of attack or harm.
Other differences in students’ reports on their safety
were detected by student and school characteristics in
2007. For example, a higher percentage of 6th-graders
40

In 2005 and 2007, the unit response rate for this survey
did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret
the data with caution. In 2007, the reference period was the
school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period
was the previous 6 months. Cognitive testing showed that
estimates from 2007 are comparable to previous years. For
more information, please see appendix A.
41
“At school” includes the school building, on school
property, on a school bus.

(10 percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm
at school than 7th-graders (7 percent), 8th-graders
(5 percent), 9th-graders (6 percent), 10th-graders
(5 percent), and 11th- and 12th-graders (3 percent
each). Away from school, a larger percentage of 6thgraders (6 percent) were afraid of attack or harm
than students in the 10th, 11th, or 12th grades
(2 to 3 percent).
A greater percentage of female students (6 percent)
feared for their safety at school than male students
(5 percent) in 2007. The same was true away from
school: 5 percent of females feared for their safety
compared to 2 percent of males.
School sector was also related to students’ fear of
attack or harm. A greater percentage of students in
public schools (6 percent) reported being afraid of
being attacked or harmed at school than students
attending private schools (2 percent). There was no
significant difference in the percentage of public and
private school students who reported being afraid of
attack or harm away from school.
Between 1995 and 2007, the percentage of students
who feared attack or harm at school decreased from
12 to 5 percent. Between the two most recent survey
years, 2005 and 2007, the percentage of students who
feared attack or harm at school was lower in 2007
(5 percent) than in 2005 (6 percent). Away from
school, there was no pattern of increase or decrease in
the percentage of students who feared attack or harm
between 1999 and 2007. However, the percentage
of students who feared attack or harm away from
school was smaller in 2007 (3 percent) than in 2005
(5 percent).

Indicator 18
Students’ Reports of Avoiding School Activities or Specific Places
in School
In 2007, 7 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they avoided school activities or one or more places
in school because they thought someone might attack or harm them.
School crime may lead students to perceive school
as unsafe, and in trying to ensure their own safety,
students may begin to skip school activities or avoid
certain places in school (Schreck and Miller 2003).
The percentage of students who avoid school activities
and certain areas in school is a measure of their
perception of school safety. In the School Crime
Supplement42 to the National Crime Victimization
Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked whether they
had avoided school activities or one or more places
in school because they were fearful that someone
might attack or harm them.43 In 2007, 7 percent
of students reported that they had avoided a school
activity or one or more places in school during the
previous school year because of fear of attack or harm.
About 3 percent of students avoided a school activity,
and 6 percent avoided one or more places in school44
(figure 18.1 and table 18.1).
While there was no overall pattern of increase or
decrease between 1999 and 2007 in the percentage
of students who reported that they had avoided a
school activity or one or more places in school because

In 2005 and 2007, the unit response rate for this survey
did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret
the data with caution. In 2007, the reference period was the
school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period
was the previous 6 months. Cognitive testing showed that
estimates from 2007 are comparable to previous years. For
more information, please see appendix A.
43
For the 2001 survey, the wording was changed from “attack or harm” to “attack or threat of attack.” See appendix A
for more information.
44
 “Avoided school activities” includes avoiding any (extracurricular) activities, skipping class, or staying home from
school. In 2007, the survey wording was changed from
“any extracurricular activities” to “any activities.” Please use
caution when comparing changes in this item over time.
Avoiding one or more places in school includes the entrance,
any hallways or stairs, parts of the cafeteria, restrooms, and
other places inside the school building.

they were fearful that someone might attack or
harm them, the percentage of students who reported
avoiding an activity or place because of fear of attack
or harm was higher in 2007 (7 percent) than in 2005
(6 percent).
In 2007, 2 percent of students reported that they had
avoided any activity, 1 percent of students reported
that they had avoided a class, and 1 percent of
students reported that they had stayed home from
school because they were fearful someone might
attack or harm them. One percent of students
reported that they had avoided the entrance to the
school, 3 percent that they had avoided the stairs or
hallways, 2 percent that they had avoided parts of the
school cafeteria, 3 percent that they had avoided any
school restrooms, and 1 percent that they had avoided
other places inside the school building because of fear
of attack or harm in 2007.
Students’ reports of avoiding one or more places
in school because of fear of attack or harm varied
by student and school characteristics. A higher
percentage of 7th-graders (7 percent), 8th-graders
(6 percent), 9th-graders (7 percent), and 10th-graders
(5 percent) reported avoiding one or more places
inside school than 12th-graders (3 percent) (figure
18.2). Additionally, a higher percentage of 6th-graders
(8 percent), 7th-graders (7 percent), and 9th-graders
(7 percent) than 11th-graders (4 percent) reported
of avoiding one or more places in school because of
fear of attack or harm. No measurable difference was
detected in the extent to which females and males
avoided one or more places in school in 2007 (5 and
6 percent, respectively).
A larger percentage of public school students
(6 percent) than private school students (1 percent)
reported avoiding one or more places inside school
because of fear of attack or harm.

This indicator has been updated to include 2007 data. For more information: Tables 18.1 and 18.2 and Bauer et al. (2008).

Serious Disciplinary Actions Taken by Public Schools
Forty-eight percent of public schools (approximately 39,600 schools) took a serious disciplinary action against
a student for specific offenses during the 2005–06 school year. Of those disciplinary actions, 74 percent
were suspensions lasting 5 days or more, 5 percent were removals with no services (i.e., expulsions), and 20
percent were transfers to specialized schools.
In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public
school officials were asked to report the number
of disciplinary actions their schools took against
students for specific offenses.
Forty-eight percent of public schools (approximately
39,600 schools) took at least one serious disciplinary
action against a student—including suspensions
lasting 5 days or more, removals with no services
(i.e., expulsions), and transfers to specialized
schools—for specific offenses during the 2005–06
school year (table 19.1). The offenses included physical
attacks or fights; insubordination; distribution,
possession, or use of alcohol; distribution, possession,
or use of illegal drugs; use or possession of a
weapon other than a firearm or explosive device;
and use or possession of a firearm or explosive
device. Of the 830,700 serious disciplinary actions
taken during the 2005–06 school year, 74 percent
were suspensions for 5 days or more, 5 percent were
removals with no services, and 20 percent were
transfers to specialized schools.
The largest percentage of schools that reported taking
a disciplinary action in 2005–06 did so in response
to a physical attack or fight: 32 percent of schools

took a serious disciplinary action for physical attacks
or fights (figure 19.1 and table 19.1). Of the schools
that reported taking a serious disciplinary action,
21 percent took action for insubordination and
for distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs;
19 percent took action as a result of use or possession
of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device;
10 percent did so for distribution, possession, or use
of alcohol; and 5 percent did so for use or possession
of a firearm or explosive device.
The percentage of schools that took a serious
disciplinary action for use or possession of a weapon
other than a firearm was higher in 2005–06,
19 percent, than in 2003–04, 17 percent (table
19.2). The percentage of schools that took a serious
disciplinary action in response to the other offenses
covered in the survey were not measurably different
between 2003–04 and 2005–06. The percentage
of public schools that took a serious disciplinary
action was smaller in 2003–04, 46 percent, than in
1999–2000, 54 percent (figure 19.2 and table 19.2).
This pattern held for physical attacks or fights: in
1999–2000, 35 percent of public schools took a
serious disciplinary action for a physical attack or
fight, compared to 32 percent in 2003–04.

This indicator repeats information from the 2007 Indicators of School Crime and Safety report. For more information: Tables 19.1
and 19.2 and Nolle, Guerino, and Dinkes (2007).

Safety and Security Measures Taken by Public Schools
Between the 1999–2000 and 2005–06 school years, the percentage of schools using one or more security
cameras to monitor the school increased from 19 to 43 percent.
Public schools use a variety of practices and procedures intended to promote the safety of students and
staff. This indicator provides information on what
types of safety and security measures schools use
and how frequently they use them. In the School
Survey on Crime and Safety, public school officials
were asked about their school’s use of such measures
and procedures. Certain practices, such as locked
or monitored doors or gates, are intended to limit
or control access to school campuses, while others,
such as metal detectors, security cameras, and drug
sweeps, are intended to monitor or restrict students’
and visitors’ behavior on campus.
In the 2005–06 school year, 85 percent of public
schools controlled access to school buildings by
locking or monitoring doors during school hours, and
41 percent controlled access to school grounds with
locked or monitored gates (figure 20.1 and table 20.1).
About 48 percent of public schools required faculty
and staff to wear badges or picture identification,
and 43 percent used one or more security cameras
to monitor the school. Five percent of public schools
performed drug testing on athletes and 3 percent
did so for students in other extracurricular activities.
Students were required to wear uniforms in 14 percent
of public schools in 2005–06.
The use of security measures varied by school level.
Although a lower percentage of primary schools

than middle and high schools reported using many
of these measures, a higher percentage of primary
schools than middle and high schools controlled
access to school buildings and grounds during school
hours (table 20.1). In addition, a larger percentage of
primary schools than high schools reported requiring
students to wear uniforms: 16 percent of primary
schools required uniforms in 2005–06, compared
to 5 percent of high schools. A higher percentage of
public high schools than primary or middle schools
reported performing drug tests on student athletes
and students in extracurricular activities, random
dog sniffs to check for drugs, random sweeps for
contraband, and using security cameras. Thirteen
percent of high schools reported performing drug tests
on athletes, compared to 7 percent of middle schools
and 1 percent of primary schools; and 61 percent of
high schools performed random dog sniffs to check
for drugs, compared to 41 percent and 4 percent of
middle and primary schools, respectively.
The percentage of schools using various security
measures has changed over time. Between the 1999–
2000 and 2005–06 school years, the percentage
of schools using one or more security cameras to
monitor the school increased from 19 to 43 percent
(figure 20.2 and table 20.2). The percentage of public
schools providing telephones in most classrooms
also increased, from 45 percent in 1999–2000 to
67 percent in 2005–06.

Students’ Reports of Safety and Security Measures Observed at
School
Sixty-six percent of students reported observing the use of one or more security cameras at their school in
2007 compared to 58 percent of students in 2005.
Schools use a variety of measures to promote the
safety of students, ranging from codes of student
conduct to metal detectors. In the School Crime
Supplement45 to the National Crime Victimization
Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked whether their
school used certain security measures.46 Security
measures include metal detectors, locker checks,
security cameras, security guards or police officers,
adult supervision in hallways, badges or picture
identification for students, a code of student conduct,
locked entrance or exit doors during the day, and a
requirement that visitors sign in. In 2007, nearly all
students ages 12–18 observed the use of at least one of
the selected security measures at their school (figure
21.1 and table 21.1).
In 2007, the majority of students ages 12–18 reported
that their school had a code of student conduct (96
percent) and a requirement that visitors sign in (94
percent). Ninety percent of students reported the
presence of school staff or other adult supervision in
the hallway, and 69 percent reported the presence
of security guards and/or assigned police officers.
Fifty-four percent of students reported locker checks,
61 percent reported locked entrance or exit doors
during the day, and 66 percent reported the use
of security cameras at their schools. Twenty-four

Readers should note that this indicator relies on student
reports of security measures and provides estimates based
on students’ awareness of the measure rather than on documented practice. See Indicator 20 for a summary of the use of
various security measures as reported by schools.

percent of students reported that badges or picture
identification were required. Metal detectors were
the least observed of the selected safety and security
measures: 10 percent of students reported the use of
metal detectors at their school.
The percentage of students reporting the presence
of some of the selected security measures increased
between the 2 most recent survey years as well as
over longer time periods. For example, a greater
percentage of students reported observing the use
of one or more security cameras at their school in
2007 (66 percent) than in 2005 (58 percent). Over
the longer time period of 2001 through 2007, the
percentage of students who reported observing the
use of one or more security cameras at their school
increased from 39 to 66 percent. Similarly, a greater
percentage of students reported locked entrance or
exit doors during the day in 2007 (61 percent) than
in 2005 (54 percent). Over the longer time period of
1999 through 2007, the percentage of students who
reported locked entrance or exit doors during the day
increased from 38 to 61 percent.
In 2007, about 94 percent of students reported that
their school had a requirement that visitors sign
in compared to 93 percent of students in 2005.
Between 1999 and 2007, the percentage of students
who reported a visitor sign-in requirement increased
from 87 to 94 percent. No significant differences
were detected in the percentage of students who
reported metal detectors, locker checks, the presence
of security guards and/or assigned police officers,
requirements that students wear badges or picture
identification, or a code of student conduct in their
schools across all survey years.

Serious violent crimes are also included in violent crimes. 								
NOTE: The dashed horizontal line indicates a break in trend due to a redesign of the methods used to measure victimization in the 2006 National
Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). Due to this redesign, please use caution when comparing 2006 estimates with estimates of earlier years. Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and simple assault.
Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and completed thefts except motor vehicle
thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which threat or use of force is involved. Total crimes include violent crimes and theft. “At school” includes
inside the school building, on school property, or on the way to or from school. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Estimates of
number of crimes are rounded to the nearest 100. Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on similar topics, the survey sources for these
two indicators differ with respect to time coverage and administration. For more information on these two surveys, please see appendix A. Estimates
were revised and may differ from previously published data.

Serious violent crimes are also included in violent crimes.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian (prior to 2005), Pacific Islander, and,
from 2003 onward, more than one race. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with
caution.													
NOTE: Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and completed thefts except motor
vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which threat or use of force is involved. Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery,
and aggravated assault. Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and simple assault. Total crimes include violent crimes and theft. “At school”
includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. In 2005 and 2007, the unit
response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. Due to a redesign of the methods
used to measure urbanicity, estimates for 2007 locales are not shown. For more information, please see appendix A. Estimates were revised and
may differ from previously published data. Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on similar topics, the survey sources for these two indicators differ with respect to time coverage and administration. For more information on these two surveys, please see appendix A.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.									
2
The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995,
and 1997, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing more
than one race.

Theft/larceny (taking things worth over $10 without personal confrontation) was defined for respondents as “the unlawful taking of another person’s
property without personal confrontation, threat, violence, or bodily harm. Included are pocket picking, stealing a purse or backpack (if left unattended
or no force was used to take it from owner), theft from a building, theft from a motor vehicle or of motor vehicle parts or accessories, theft of bicycles,
theft from vending machines, and all other types of thefts.”

The questionnaire wording for possession of a knife or sharp object differed between survey administrations. In 1999–2000 and 2005–06, the
question asked about possession of a knife or sharp object. In 2003–04, the question referred to possession of a knife or sharp object with intent to
harm, and was not comparable to data for 1999–2000 and 2005–06. 								
NOTE: Table was revised on November 23, 2009. Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and
safety issues at the school. “At school” was defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on
school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before,
during, or after normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Estimates of number of incidents are rounded to the nearest 100.

Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of full-time-equivalent
(FTE) teachers and aides. The total number of FTE teachers and aides is a combination of the full-time and part-time teachers and aides, including
special education teachers and aides, with an adjustment for part-time status.

Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 8.
Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. High
schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades,
including K–12 schools.
4
These estimates exclude data from the 73 schools that did not report estimates of student race/ethnicity.
5
Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of full-time-equivalent (FTE)
teachers and aides. The total number of FTE teachers and aides is a combination of the full-time and part-time teachers and aides, including special
education teachers and aides, with an adjustment for part-time status.
6
Violent incidents include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, threat of physical attack or fight
with or without a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At school” was
defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold schoolsponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to respond only for those times that were during normal school hours or when school
activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified otherwise. Population size is 83,200 public schools. Estimates were revised and
may differ from previously published data.

In 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period was the previous 6 months. Cognitive testing
showed that estimates from 2007 are comparable to previous years.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian (prior to 2005), Pacific Islander, and,
from 2003 onward, more than one race. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made
with caution.												
NOTE: Data for 2005 have been revised from previously published figures. All gangs, whether or not they are involved in violent or illegal activity,
are included. “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. In 2005 and 2007, the unit
response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. Due to a redesign of the methods
used to measure urbanicity, estimates for 2007 locales are not shown. For more information, please see appendix A.

The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995,
and 1997, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing more
than one race.								
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents.

In 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period was the previous 6 months. Cognitive testing showed that estimates from 2007 are comparable to previous years.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian (prior to 2005), Pacific Islander, and,
from 2003 onward, more than one race. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with
caution.											
NOTE: Data for 2005 have been revised from previously published figures. “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school
bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. Hate-related refers to derogatory terms used by others in reference to students’ personal
characteristics. In 2005 and 2007, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with
caution. Due to a redesign of the methods used to measure urbanicity, estimates for 2007 locales are not shown. For more information, please see
appendix A.

In the School Crime Supplement (SCS) questionnaire, students were asked if they had been the target of hate-related words at school. Students
who indicated that they had been called a hate-related word were asked to choose the specific characteristics that the hate-related word targeted.
Students were allowed to choose more than one characteristic. If a student chose more than one characteristic, he or she is counted once under
the “total” category. Therefore, the total percentage of students who reported being called a hate-related word is less than the sum of the students’
individual characteristics.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian (prior to 2005), Pacific Islander, and,
from 2003 onward, more than one race. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with
caution.												
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. Hate-related refers to derogatory
terms used by others in reference to students’ personal characteristics. In 2007, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical
standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. Due to a redesign of the methods used to measure urbanicity, estimates for 2007 locales are
not shown. For more information, please see appendix A.

Cyber-bullied includes students who responded that another student “made unwanted contact, for example, threatened or insulted [the respondent]
via text (SMS) messaging.” This category did not meet reporting standards to be reported separately.

This was defined as another student making “unwanted contact, for example, threatened or insulted [the respondent] via instant messaging.”

NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. Bullying types do not sum to total
because students could have experienced more than one type of bullying. In 2007, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. Due to a redesign of the methods used to measure urbanicity, estimates for 2007 locales

Injury includes bruises or swelling; cuts, scratches, or scrapes; black eye or bloody nose; teeth chipped or knocked out; broken bones or internal
injuries; knocked unconscious; or other injuries. Only students who reported that their bullying incident constituted being pushed, shoved, tripped, or
spit on were asked if they suffered injuries as a result of the incident.							
2
Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Pacific Islander, and more than one race.	
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. For more information, please
see appendix A. Location totals may sum to more than 100 because students could have been bullied in more than one location. In 2007, the unit
response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. Due to a redesign of the methods
used to measure urbanicity, estimates for 2007 locales are not shown. For more information, please see appendix A.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. 									
2
The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995,
and 1997, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing more
than one race.												
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are
simply asked how many times in the last 12 months they have been in a physical fight.

are simply asked how many days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days. The estimate for the United States is drawn from a nationally
representative sample of schools and is not the aggregate of participating states. Each state estimate is based on a sample that is representative of
that state. Estimates were revised and may differ from previously published data.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.

The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995,
and 1997, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing more
than one race.												
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are
simply asked how many days did they have at least one drink of alcohol during the past 30 days.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.									
2
The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995,
and 1997, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing more
than one race.												
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are
simply asked how many times during the past 30 days they used marijuana.

testing showed that estimates from 2007 are comparable to previous years.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian (prior to 2005), Pacific Islander, and,
from 2003 onward, more than one race. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made
with caution.												
NOTE: Data for 2005 have been revised from previously published figures. “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school
bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. For the 2001 survey, the wording was changed from “attack or harm” to “attack or threat of
attack.” Includes students who reported that they sometimes or most of the time feared being victimized in this way. Fear of attack away from school
was not collected in 1995. In 2005 and 2007, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the
data with caution. Due to a redesign of the methods used to measure urbanicity, estimates for 2007 locales are not shown. For more information,
please see appendix A.

In 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period was the previous 6 months. Cognitive testing
showed that estimates from 2007 are comparable to previous years.							
2
Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, (Asian prior to 2005), Pacific Islander, and,
from 2003 onward, more than one race. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with
caution.										
NOTE: Data for 2005 have been revised from previously published figures. Places include the entrance, any hallways or stairs, parts of the
cafeteria, restrooms, and other places inside the school building. For the 2001 survey, the wording was changed from “attack or harm” to “attack or
threat of attack.” In 2005 and 2007, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with
caution. Due to a redesign of the methods used to measure urbanicity, estimates for 2007 locales are not shown. For more information, please see

Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 8.
Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. High
schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades,
including K–12 schools.
5
These estimates exclude data from the 73 schools that did not report estimates of student race/ethnicity.
6
Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of full-time-equivalent (FTE)
teachers and aides. The total number of FTE teachers and aides is a combination of the full-time and part-time teachers and aides, including special
education teachers and aides, with an adjustment for part-time status.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. Respondents
were instructed to respond only for those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the
survey specified otherwise. Population size is 83,200 public schools.

Technical Notes
General Information
The indicators in this report are based on information
drawn from a variety of independent data sources,
including national surveys of students, teachers,
and principals, and data collections from federal
departments and agencies, including the Bureau of
Justice Statistics, the National Center for Education
Statistics, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Each data source has an independent sample design,
data collection method, and questionnaire design or
is the result of a universe data collection. Universe
data collections include a census of all known entities
in a specific universe (e.g., all deaths occurring on
school property). Readers should be cautious when
comparing data from different sources. Differences in
sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and
question phrasing can all affect the comparability of
results. For example, some questions from different
surveys may appear the same, but were asked of
different populations of students (e.g., students ages
12–18 or students in grades 9–12); in different years;
about experiences that occurred within different
periods of time (e.g., in the past 30 days or during
the past 12 months); or at different locations (e.g., in
school or anywhere).
All comparisons described in this report are statistically
significant at the .05 level. Estimates displayed in the
text, figures, and tables are rounded from original
estimates, not from a series of rounding.
The following is a description of data sources,
accuracy of estimates, and statistical procedures used
in this report.

School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study
(SAVD)
The School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance
Study (SAVD) is an epidemiological study developed
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
conjunction with the U.S. Department of Education
and the U.S. Department of Justice. SAVD seeks to
describe the epidemiology of school-associated violent
deaths, identify common features of these deaths,
estimate the rate of school-associated violent death in
the United States, and identify potential risk factors
for these deaths. The surveillance system includes
descriptive data on all school-associated violent deaths
in the United States, including all homicides, suicides,
and unintentional firearm-related deaths where the
fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning
elementary or secondary school, while the victim
was on the way to or from regular sessions at such a
school, or while attending or on the way to or from an
official school-sponsored event. Victims of such events
include nonstudents as well as students and staff
members. SAVD includes descriptive information
about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s).
The SAVD Surveillance System has collected data
from July 1, 1992, through the present.
SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and collect
data on school-associated violent deaths. Cases are
initially identified through a search of the Lexis/
Nexis newspaper and media database. Then police
officials are contacted to confirm the details of the
case and to determine if the event meets the case
definition. Once a case is confirmed, a police official
and a school official are interviewed regarding details
about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). A
copy of the full police report is also sought for each
case. The information obtained on schools includes
school demographics, attendance/absentee rates,
suspension/expulsions and mobility, school history
of weapon-carrying incidents, security measures,
violence prevention activities, school response to the
event, and school policies about weapon carrying.
Event information includes the location of injury,
the context of injury (while classes were being held,
during break, etc.), motives for injury, method of
injury, and school and community events happening
around the time period. Information obtained on
victim(s) and offender(s) includes demographics,
circumstances of the event (date/time, alcohol or
drug use, number of persons involved), types and
origins of weapons, criminal history, psychological
risk factors, school-related problems, extracurricular

activities, and family history, including structure
and stressors.
One hundred and five school-associated violent deaths
were identified from July 1, 1992 to June 30, 1994
(Kachur et al. 1996). A more recent report from
this data collection identified 253 school-associated
violent deaths between July 1, 1994 and June 30,
1999 (Anderson et al. 2001). Other publications from
this study have described how the number of events
changes during the school year (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention 2001), the source of the
firearms used in these events (Reza et al. 2003), and
suicides that were associated with schools (Kauffman
et al. 2004). The interviews conducted on cases
between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1999, achieved
a response rate of 97 percent for police officials and
78 percent for school officials. The SAVD data are
considered preliminary until interviews with school
and law enforcement officials have been completed.
The details learned during the interviews can
occasionally change the classification of a case. For

Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR)
The Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR),
which are a part of the Uniform Crime Reporting
(UCR) program, provide incident-level information
on criminal homicides, including situation (number
of victims to number of offenders); the age, sex, and
race of victims and offenders; types of weapons used;
circumstances of the incident; and the relationship
of the victim to the offender. The data are provided
monthly to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
by local law enforcement agencies participating in the
FBI’s UCR program. The data include murders and
nonnegligent manslaughters in the United States from
January 1976 to December 2005; that is, negligent
manslaughters and justifiable homicides have been
eliminated from the data. Based on law enforcement
agency reports, the FBI estimates that 594,277
murders (including non-negligent manslaughters)
were committed from 1976 to 2005. Agencies
provided detailed information on 538,210 victims
and 597,359 offenders.

About 91 percent of homicides are included in the
SHR. However, adjustments can be made to the
weights to correct for missing reports. Estimates
from the SHR used in this report were generated by
the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) using a weight
developed by BJS that reconciles the counts of SHR
homicide victims with those in the UCR for the 1992
through 2005 data years. The weight is the same for
all cases for a given year. The weight represents the
ratio of the number of homicides reported in the UCR
to the number reported in the SHR. For additional

Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting
System Fatal (WISQARS™ Fatal)
WISQARS Fatal provides mortality data related to
injury. The mortality data reported in WISQARS
Fatal come from death certificate data reported to
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data
include causes of death reported by attending
physicians, medical examiners, and coroners. It also
includes demographic information about decedents
reported by funeral directors, who obtain that information from family members and other informants.
NCHS collects, compiles, verifies, and prepares
these data for release to the public. The data provide
information about what types of injuries are leading
causes of deaths, how common they are, and who they
affect. These data are intended for a broad audience—
the public, the media, public health practitioners and
researchers, and public health officials—to increase
their knowledge of injury.
WISQARS Fatal mortality reports provide tables of
the total numbers of injury-related deaths and the
death rates per 100,000 U.S. population. The reports
list deaths according to cause (mechanism) and intent
(manner) of injury by state, race, Hispanic origin,
sex, and age groupings. For more information on

National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS),
administered for the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics
by the U.S. Census Bureau, is the nation’s primary
source of information on crime and the victims of
crime. Initiated in 1972 and redesigned in 1992,
the NCVS collects detailed information annually
on the frequency and nature of the crimes of rape,
sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault,
theft, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft
experienced by Americans and their households each
year. The survey measures both crimes reported to
police and crimes not reported to the police.
Readers should note that in 2003, in accordance with
changes to the Office of Management and Budget’s
standards for the classification of federal data on race
and ethnicity, the NCVS item on race/ethnicity was
modified. A question on Hispanic origin is followed
by a question on race. The new question about race
allows the respondent to choose more than one race
and delineates Asian as a separate category from
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Analysis
conducted by the Demographic Surveys Division at
the U.S. Census Bureau showed that the new question
had very little impact on the aggregate racial distribution of the NCVS respondents, with one exception.
There was a 1.6 percentage point decrease in the
percentage of respondents who reported themselves
as White. Due to changes in race/ethnicity categories,
comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be
made with caution.
Due to changes in survey methodology in 2006
that mainly affected rural areas, 2006 estimates are
not comparable to estimates based on NCVS data
from previous years. Continuity between urban and
suburban areas in the sample for both years (2005
and 2006) enabled year-to-year comparisons for
these areas. The U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of
Justice Statistics (BJS), and a panel of outside experts
extensively reviewed the 2006 NCVS data and determined that there was a break in series between 2006
and previous years that prevented annual comparison
of criminal victimization at the national level. This
was mainly the result of three major changes in the
survey methodology: (1) introducing a new sample
to account for shifts in population and location of
households that occur over time, (2) incorporating
responses from households that were in the survey
for the first time, and (3) using computer-assisted
136

Appendix A: Technical Notes

personal interviewing (CAPI). For more information
on the 2006 NCVS data, see Criminal Victimization,
2006 at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cv06
.pdf and the technical notes at http://www.ojp.usdoj
.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cv06tn.pdf.
The number of NCVS eligible households in the
sample in 2006 was about 41,800. They were selected
using a stratified, multistage cluster design. In the
first stage, the primary sampling units (PSUs),
consisting of counties or groups of counties, were
selected. In the second stage, smaller areas, called
Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected from
each sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs,
clusters of four households, called segments, were
selected for interview. At each stage, the selection
was done proportionate to population size in
order to create a self-weighting sample. The final
sample was augmented to account for households
constructed after the decennial Census. Within each
sampled household, U.S. Census Bureau personnel
interviewed all household members age 12 and older
to determine whether they had been victimized by
the measured crimes during the 6 months preceding
the interview.
The first NCVS interview with a housing unit is
conducted in person. Subsequent interviews are
conducted by telephone, if possible. About 68,000
persons age 12 and older are interviewed each 6
months. Households remain in the sample for 3 years
and are interviewed seven times at 6-month intervals.
Since the survey’s inception, the initial interview
at each sample unit has been used only to bound
future interviews to establish a time frame to avoid
duplication of crimes uncovered in these subsequent
interviews. Beginning in 2006, data from the initial
interview have been adjusted to account for the effects
of bounding and are included in the survey estimates.
After their seventh interview, households are replaced
by new sample households. The NCVS has consistently obtained a response rate of over 90 percent at
the household level. The completion rates for persons
within households were about 86 percent. Thus, final
response rates were about 78 percent in 2006. Weights
were developed to permit estimates for the total U.S.
population 12 years and older. For more information

School Crime Supplement (SCS)
Created as a supplement to the NCVS and codesigned
by the National Center for Education Statistics
and Bureau of Justice Statistics, the School Crime
Supplement (SCS) survey was conducted in 1989,
1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007 to collect
additional information about school-related victimizations on a national level. This report includes data
from the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007
collections. The 1989 data are not included in this
report as a result of methodological changes to the
NCVS and SCS. The survey was designed to assist
policymakers as well as academic researchers and
practitioners at the federal, state, and local levels so
that they can make informed decisions concerning
crime in schools. The SCS asks students a number
of key questions about their experiences with and
perceptions of crime and violence that occurred inside
their school, on school grounds, on a school bus, or on
the way to or from school. Additional questions not
included in the NCVS were also added to the SCS,
such as those concerning preventive measures used
by the school, students’ participation in after school
activities, students’ perceptions of school rules, the
presence of weapons and gangs in school, the presence
of hate-related words and graffiti in school, student
reports of bullying and reports of rejection at school,
and the availability of drugs and alcohol in school,
as well as attitudinal questions relating to fear of
victimization and avoidance behavior at school.
In all SCS survey years through 2005, the SCS was
conducted for a 6-month period from January to
June in all households selected for the NCVS (see
discussion above for information about the NCVS
sampling design and changes to the race/ethnicity item
made for 2003 onward). It should be noted that the
initial NCVS interview has always been included in
the SCS data collection. Within these households, the
eligible respondents for the SCS were those household
members who had attended school at any time during
the 6 months preceding the interview, were enrolled in
grades 6–12, and were not home schooled. In 2007, the
questionnaire was changed and household members
who attended school any time during the school year
were included. The age range of students covered in
this report is 12–18 years of age. Eligible respondents
were asked the supplemental questions in the SCS only
after completing their entire NCVS interview.
The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999, 2001,
2003, 2005, and 2007 was calculated by using NCVS

incident variables appended to the 1995, 1999, 2001,
2003, 2005, and 2007 SCS data ﬁles. The NCVS type
of crime variable was used to classify victimizations
of students in the SCS as serious violent, violent, or
theft. The NCVS variables asking where the incident
happened and what the victim was doing when it
happened were used to ascertain whether the incident
happened at school. For prevalence of victimization,
the NCVS definition of “at school” includes in the
school building, on school property, or on the way to
or from school. Only incidents that occurred inside
the United States are included.
In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modified
from previous collections. First, in 1995 and 1999, “at
school” was defined for respondents as in the school
building, on the school grounds, or on a school bus.
In 2001, the definition for “at school” was changed
to mean in the school building, on school property,
on a school bus, or going to and from school. This
change was made to the 2001 questionnaire in order
to be consistent with the definition of “at school” as
it is constructed in the NCVS and was also used as
the definition in 2003, 2005, and 2007. Cognitive
interviews conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on
the 1999 SCS suggested that modifications to the
definition of “at school” would not have a substantial
impact on the estimates.
A total of 9,728 students participated in the 1995
SCS, 8,398 in 1999, 8,374 in 2001, 7,152 in 2003,
6,297 in 2005, and 5,618 in 2007. In the 2007 SCS,
the household completion rate was 90 percent. In
the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 SCS, the
household completion rates were 95 percent, 94
percent, 93 percent, 92 percent, and 91 percent,
respectively, and the student completion rates were 78
percent, 78 percent, 77 percent, 70 percent, and 62
percent respectively. For the 2007 SCS, the student
completion rate was 58 percent.
Thus, the overall unweighted SCS response rate
(calculated by multiplying the household completion rate by the student completion rate) was 74
percent in 1995, 73 percent in 1999, 72 percent in
2001, 64 percent in 2003, 56 percent in 2005, and
53 percent in 2007. Response rates for most survey
items were high—typically over 95 percent of all
eligible respondents. The weights were developed to
compensate for differential probabilities of selection
and nonresponse. The weighted data permit inferences about the eligible student population who were
enrolled in schools in 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005,
and 2007.

Due to the low unit response rate in 2005 and 2007,
a unit nonresponse bias analysis was done. There are
two types of nonresponse: unit and item nonresponse.
Unit response rates indicate how many sampled units
have completed interviews. Because interviews with
students could only be completed after households
had responded to the NCVS, the unit completion
rate for the SCS reflects both the household interview
completion rate and the student interview completion
rate. Nonresponse can greatly affect the strength
and application of survey data by leading to an
increase in variance as a result of a reduction in the
actual size of the sample and can produce bias if the
nonrespondents have characteristics of interest that
are different from the respondents. Furthermore,
imputation, a common recourse to nonresponse,
can lead to the risk of underestimating the sampling
error if imputed data are treated as though they were
observed data.
In order for response bias to occur, respondents
must have different response rates and responses to
particular survey variables. The magnitude of unit
nonresponse bias is determined by the response
rate and the differences between respondents and
nonrespondents on key survey variables. Although the
bias analysis cannot measure response bias since the
SCS is a sample survey and it is not known how the
population would have responded, the SCS sampling
frame has four key student or school characteristic
variables for which data is known for respondents
and nonrespondents: sex, race/ethnicity, household
income, and urbanicity, all of which are associated
with student victimization. To the extent that there
are differential responses by respondents in these
groups, nonresponse bias is a concern.
In 2005, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of bias for the race, household income, and
urbanicity variables. White (non-Hispanic) and Other
(non-Hispanic) respondents had higher response
rates than Black (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic
respondents. Respondents from households with an
income of $35,000–$49,999 and $50,000 or more
had higher response rates than those from households
with incomes of less than $7,500, $7,500–$14,999,
$15,000–$24,999 and $25,000–$34,999. Respondents who live in urban areas had lower response
rates than those who live in rural or suburban areas.
Although the extent of nonresponse bias cannot be
determined, weighting adjustments, which corrected
for differential response rates, should have reduced
the problem.

In 2007, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of bias by race, household income, and
urbanicity variables. Hispanic respondents had
lower response rates than other race/ethnicities.
Respondents from households with an income of
$25,000 or more had higher response rates than
those from households with incomes of less than
$7,500. Respondents who live in urban areas had
lower response rates than those who live in rural areas.
However, when responding students are compared to
the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable
differences between the responding students and the
eligible students, suggesting the nonresponse bias has
little impact on the overall estimates.

Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)
The National School-Based Youth Risk Behavior
Survey (YRBS) is one component of the Youth
Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), an
epidemiological surveillance system developed by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
to monitor the prevalence of youth behaviors that
most influence health.1 The YRBS focuses on priority
health-risk behaviors established during youth that
result in the most significant mortality, morbidity,
disability, and social problems during both youth and
adulthood. This report uses 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999,
2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007 YRBS data.
The YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling design
to produce a nationally representative sample of
students in grades 9–12 in the United States. The
target population consisted of all public and private
school students in grades 9–12 in the 50 states and the
District of Columbia. The first-stage sampling frame
included selecting primary sampling units (PSUs)
from strata formed on the basis of urbanization and
the relative percentage of Black and Hispanic students
in the PSU. These PSUs are either counties, subareas of
large counties, or groups of smaller, adjacent counties.
At the second stage, schools were selected with
probability proportional to school enrollment size.

Brener et al. (2004).

Appendix A: Technical Notes

The final stage of sampling consisted of randomly
selecting, in each chosen school and in each of
grades 9–12, one or two classrooms from either a
required subject, such as English or social studies,
or a required period, such as homeroom or second
period. All students in selected classes were eligible to
participate. Three strategies were used to oversample
Black and Hispanic students: (1) larger sampling rates
were used to select PSUs that are in high-Black and
high-Hispanic strata; (2) a modified measure of size
was used that increased the probability of selecting
schools with a disproportionately high minority
enrollment; and (3) two classes per grade, rather than
one, were selected in schools with a high minority
enrollment. Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300,
15,300, 13,600, 15,200, 13,900, and 14,000 students
participated in the 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001,
2003, 2005, and 2007 surveys, respectively.
The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993
survey, 60 percent for the 1995 survey, 69 percent
for the 1997 survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey,
63 percent for the 2001 survey, 67 percent for the 2003
survey, 67 percent for the 2005 survey, and 68 percent
for the 2007 survey. NCES standards call for response
rates of 85 percent or better for cross-sectional surveys,
and bias analyses are required by NCES when that
percentage is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full
nonresponse bias analysis has not been done because
the data necessary to do the analysis are not available.
The weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse
and the oversampling of Black and Hispanic students
in the sample. The final weights were constructed
so that only weighted proportions of students (not
weighted counts of students) in each grade matched
national population projections.
State level data were downloaded from the Youth
Online: Comprehensive Results web page (http://
apps.nccd.cdc.gov/yrbss/). Each state and local
school-based YRBS employs a two-stage, cluster
sample design to produce representative samples
of students in grades 9–12 in their jurisdiction. All
except a few state and local samples include only
public schools, and each local sample includes only
schools in the funded school district (e.g., San Diego
Unified School District) rather than in the entire city
(e.g., greater San Diego area).
In the first sampling stage in all except a few states
and districts, schools are selected with probability
proportional to school enrollment size. In the second
sampling stage, intact classes of a required subject
or intact classes during a required period (e.g.,
second period) are selected randomly. All students
in sampled classes are eligible to participate. Certain

states and districts modify these procedures to meet
their individual needs. For example, in a given
state or district, all schools, rather than a sample
of schools, might be selected to participate. State
and local surveys that have a scientifically selected
sample, appropriate documentation, and an overall
response rate greater than or equal to 60 percent are
weighted. The overall response rate reflects the school
response rate multiplied by the student response rate.
These three criteria are used to ensure that the data
from those surveys can be considered representative
of students in grades 9–12 in that jurisdiction. A
weight is applied to each record to adjust for student
nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade,
sex, and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore,
weighted estimates are representative of all students
in grades 9–12 attending schools in each jurisdiction.
Surveys that do not have an overall response rate of
greater than or equal to 60 percent and do not have
appropriate documentation are not weighted and are
not included in this report.
In 2007, a total of 39 states and 22 districts had
weighted data. In sites with weighted data, the student
sample sizes for the state and local YRBS ranged from
1,118 to 13,439. School response rates ranged from
69 to 100 percent, student response rates ranged from
60 to 92 percent, and overall response rates ranged
from 60 to 90 percent.
Readers should note that reports of these data
published by the CDC do not include percentages
where the denominator includes less than 100
unweighted cases. However, NCES publications
do not include percentages where the denominator
includes less than 30 unweighted cases. Therefore,
estimates presented here may not appear in CDC
publications of YRBS estimates and are considered
unstable by CDC standards.
In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office of
Management and Budget’s standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, the YRBS
item on race/ethnicity was modified. The version of
the race and ethnicity question used in 1993, 1995,
and 1997 was:
How do you describe yourself?
A. White—not Hispanic
B. Black—not Hispanic
C. Hispanic or Latino
D. Asian or Pacific Islander
E. American Indian or Alaskan Native
F. Other

The version used in 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and in
the 2007 state and local surveys was:
How do you describe yourself? (Select one or more
responses.)
A. American Indian or Alaska Native
B. Asian
C. Black or African American
D. Hispanic or Latino
E. Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
F. White
In the 2005 national survey and all 2007 surveys,
race/ethnicity was computed from two questions:
(1) “Are you Hispanic or Latino?” (response options
were “yes” and “no”), and (2) “What is your race?”
(response options were “American Indian or Alaska
Native,” “Asian,” “Black or African American,”
“Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,” or
“White”). For the second question, students could
select more than one response option. For this
report, students were classified as “Hispanic” if they
answered “yes” to the first question, regardless of
how they answered the second question. Students
who answered “no” to the first question and selected
more than one race/ethnicity in the second category
were classified as “More than one race.” Students
who answered “no” to the first question and selected
only one race/ethnicity were classified as that race/
ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was classified as missing for
students who did not answer the first question and
for students who answered “no” to the first question
but did not answer the second question.
CDC has conducted two studies to understand the
effect of changing the race/ethnicity item on the
YRBS. Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found
that allowing students to select more than one
response to a single race/ethnicity question on the
YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/
ethnicity among high school students. Eaton, Brener,
Kann, and Pittman (2007) found that self-reported
race/ethnicity was similar regardless of whether the
single-question or a two-question format was used.

Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS)
This report draws upon data on teacher victimization
from the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), which
provides national- and state-level data on public
schools and national- and affiliation-level data on
private schools. The 1993–94, 1999–2000, and
2003–04 SASS were collected by the U.S. Census
Bureau and sponsored by the National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES). SASS consists of four
sets of linked surveys, including surveys of schools,
the principals of each selected school, a subsample
of teachers within each school, and public school
districts. In 1993–94, there were two sets of teacher
surveys, public and private school teachers. In
1999–2000, there were four sets of teacher surveys,
public, private, public charter, and Bureau of Indian
Affairs (BIA) school teachers. In 2003–04, there
were three sets of teacher surveys, public (including
public charter), private, and BIA. For this report,
BIA and public charter schools are included with
public schools.
The public school sampling frames for the 1993–94,
1999–2000, and 2003–04 SASS were created using
the 1991–92, 1997–98, and 2001–02 NCES Common
Core of Data (CCD) Public School Universe Files,
respectively. In SASS, a school was defined as an
institution or part of an institution that provides
classroom instruction to students; has one or more
teachers to provide instruction; serves students in one
or more of grades 1–12 or the ungraded equivalent
and is located in one or more buildings. It was possible
for two or more schools to share the same building; in
this case they were treated as different schools if they
had different administrations (i.e., principals). Since
CCD and SASS differ in scope and their definition
of a school, some records were deleted, added, or
modified in order to provide better coverage and a
more efficient sample design for SASS. Data were
collected by multistage sampling, which began with
the selection of schools.
This report uses 1993–94, 1999–2000, and 2003–04
SASS data. Approximately 10,000 public schools and
3,300 private schools were selected to participate in
the 1993–94 SASS, 11,100 public schools (9,900
public schools, 100 BIA-funded schools, and 1,100
charter schools) and 3,600 private schools were
selected to participate in the 1999–2000 SASS, and
10,400 public schools (10,200 public schools and

200 BIA-funded schools) and 3,600 private schools
were selected to participate in the 2003–04 SASS.
Within each school, teachers selected were further
stratified into one of five teacher types in the following
hierarchy: (1) Asian or Pacific Islander; (2) American
Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; (3) teachers who teach
classes designed for students with limited English
proficiency; (4) teachers in their first, second, or third
year of teaching; and (5) teachers not classified in any
of the other groups. Within each teacher stratum,
teachers were selected systematically with equal
probability. In 1993–94, approximately 57,000 public
school teachers and 11,500 private school teachers
were sampled. In 1999–2000, 56,300 public school
teachers, 500 BIA teachers, 4,400 public charter
school teachers, and 10,800 private school teachers
were sampled. In 2003–04, 52,500 public school
teachers, 700 BIA teachers, and 10,000 private school
teachers were sampled.
This report focuses on responses from teachers. The
overall weighted response rate for public school
teachers in 1993–94 was 88 percent. In 1999–2000,
the overall weighted response rates were 77 percent for
public school teachers, and 86 and 72 percent for BIA
and public charter school teachers, respectively (which
are included with public school teachers for this
report). In 2003–04, the overall weighted response
rates were 76 percent for public school teachers and
86 percent for BIA-funded school teachers (who are
included with public school teachers). For private
school teachers, the overall weighted response rates
were 80 percent, 67 percent, and 70 percent in
1993–94, 1999–2000, and 2003–04, respectively.
Values were imputed for questionnaire items that
should have been answered but were not. For

School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)
The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) was
conducted by NCES in the spring of the 2005–06
school year. SSOCS focuses on incidents of specific
crimes and offenses and a variety of specific discipline
issues in public schools. It also covers characteristics
of school policies, school violence prevention
programs and policies, and school characteristics
that have been associated with school crime. The

survey was conducted with a nationally representative
sample of regular public primary, middle, high, and
combined schools in the 50 states and the District
of Columbia.
The sampling frame for the 2005–06 SSOCS was
constructed from the 2003–04 NCES Common
Core of Data (CCD) Public Elementary/Secondary
School Universe File. The CCD is an annual national
database of all public K–12 schools and school
districts. Certain types of schools were excluded
from the CCD Public School Universe File in order
to meet the sampling needs of SSOCS, including
those in the outlying U.S. areas2 and Puerto Rico;
overseas Department of Defense schools; newly
closed schools, home schools, and schools with
high grades of kindergarten or lower; special
education, vocational, or alternative schools; schools
sponsored by the Bureau of Indian Affairs; ungraded
schools; and “intermediate units”3 in California
and Pennsylvania. The sample was stratified by
instructional level, type of locale (e.g., city, urban
fringe, etc.), and enrollment size. Within the primary
strata, schools were also sorted by geographic region
and by percentage of minority enrollment. In order
to obtain a reasonable sample size of lower enrollment
schools while giving a higher probability of selection
to higher enrollment schools, the sample was allocated
to each subgroup in proportion to the sum of the
square roots of the total student enrollment in each
school in that stratum. A total of 3,565 schools were
selected for the study. In March 2006, questionnaires
were mailed to school principals, who were asked to
complete the survey or to have it completed by the
person most knowledgeable about discipline issues
at the school. A total of 2,724 schools completed
the survey. The weighted overall response rate was
80.6 percent, and weighted item nonresponse rates
ranged from 0.0 to 27.7 percent. A nonresponse bias
analysis was conducted on the 13 items with weighted
item nonresponse rates above 15 percent, and the
detected bias was not deemed problematic enough to
suppress any items from the data file. Weights were
developed to adjust for the variable probabilities of
selection and differential nonresponse and can be
used to produce national estimates for regular public
schools in the 2005–06 school year. For information
on the 1999–2000 and 2003–04 iterations, see

Accuracy of Estimates
The accuracy of any statistic is determined by the joint
effects of nonsampling and sampling errors. Both
types of error affect the estimates presented in this
report. Several sources can contribute to nonsampling
errors. For example, members of the population of
interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling
frame; sampled members refuse to answer some of
the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of
the survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse);
mistakes are made during data editing, coding,
or entry; the responses that respondents provide
differ from the “true” responses; or measurement
instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail
to measure the characteristics they are intended
to measure. Although nonsampling errors due to
questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced
somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and
imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling
errors or gauging the effects of these errors is usually
difficult.
Sampling errors occur because observations are
made on samples rather than on entire populations.
Surveys of population universes are not subject
to sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample
will differ somewhat from those that would have
been obtained by a complete census of the relevant
population using the same survey instruments,
instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a
statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling;
it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in
a particular sample. In addition, the standard errors
for two sample statistics can be used to estimate the
precision of the difference between the two statistics
and to help determine whether the difference based
on the sample is large enough so that it represents the
population difference.
Most of the data used in this report were obtained
from complex sampling designs rather than a simple
random design. The features of complex sampling
require different techniques to calculate standard
errors than are used for data collected using a simple
random sampling. Therefore, calculation of standard
142

Appendix A: Technical Notes

errors requires procedures that are markedly different
from the ones used when the data are from a simple
random sample. The Taylor series approximation
technique or the balanced repeated replication (BRR)
method was used to estimate most of the statistics
and their standard errors in this report.
Standard error calculation for data from the School
Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series
approximation method using PSU and strata variables
available from each dataset. For statistics based
on all years of NCVS data, standard errors were
derived from a formula developed by the U.S. Census
Bureau, which consists of three generalized variance
function (gvf) constant parameters that represent
the curve fitted to the individual standard errors
calculated using the Jackknife Repeated Replication
technique.
The coefficient of variation (CV ) represents the ratio
of the standard error to the mean. As an attribute
of a distribution, the CV is an important measure of
the reliability and accuracy of an estimate. In this
report, the CV was calculated for all estimates, and
in cases where the CV was at least 30 percent the
estimates were noted with a ! symbol (interpret data
with caution). In cases where the CV was greater than
50 percent, the estimate was determined not to meet
reporting standards and was suppressed.

Statistical Procedures
The comparisons in the text have been tested for
statistical significance to ensure that the differences
are larger than might be expected due to sampling
variation. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited
in the report are statistically significant at the .05 level.
Several test procedures were used, depending upon
the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the
statement being tested. The primary test procedure
used in this report was Student’s t statistic, which
tests the difference between two sample estimates,
for example, between males and females. The formula
used to compute the t statistic is as follows:

t=

E1 - E2
√se  12

+

se  22

	

(1)

where E1 and E2 are the estimates to be compared
and se1 and se2 are their corresponding standard
errors. Note that this formula is valid only for
independent estimates. When the estimates are not
independent (for example, when comparing a total
percentage with that for a subgroup included in the
total), a covariance term (i.e., 2 * r * se1 * se2) must
be subtracted from the denominator of the formula:

t=

E1 - E2
√se  12

+

se  22 -

	

(2 * r * se1 * se2 )

(2)

where r is the correlation coefficient. Once the t value
was computed, it was compared with the published
tables of values at certain critical levels, called
alpha levels. For this report, an alpha value of .05
was used, which has a t value of 1.96. If the t value
was larger than 1.96, then the difference between
the two estimates is statistically significant at the
95 percent level.
A linear trend test was used when differences among
percentages were examined relative to ordered
categories of a variable, rather than the differences
between two discrete categories. This test allows one
to examine whether, for example, the percentage of
students using drugs increased (or decreased) over
time or whether the percentage of students who
reported being physically attacked in school increased
(or decreased) with their age. Based on a regression
with, for example, student’s age as the independent
variable and whether a student was physically attacked
as the dependent variable, the test involves computing
the regression coefficient (b) and its corresponding
standard error (se). The ratio of these two (b/se) is the
test statistic t. If t is greater than 1.96, the critical

value for one comparison at the .05 alpha level,
the hypothesis that there is a linear relationship
between student’s age and being physically attacked
is not rejected.
Some comparisons among categories of an ordered
variable with three or more levels involved a test for a
linear trend across all categories, rather than a series
of tests between pairs of categories. In this report,
when differences among percentages were examined
relative to a variable with ordered categories, analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear
relationship between the two variables. To do this,
ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts
corresponding to successive levels of the independent
variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors
(that is, standard errors that were calculated by the
Taylor series method), the variance between the
means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used
to partition the total sum of squares into within- and
between-group sums of squares. These were used to
create mean squares for the within- and betweengroup variance components and their corresponding
F statistics, which were then compared with published
values of F for a significance level of .05. Significant
values of both the overall F and the F associated with
the linear contrast term were required as evidence of
a linear relationship between the two variables.

Glossary of Terms
General Terms

Specific Terms Used in Various Surveys

Crime Any violation of a statute or regulation or any
act that the government has determined is injurious
to the public, including felonies and misdemeanors.
Such violation may or may not involve violence, and
it may affect individuals or property.

School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance
Study

Incident A specific criminal act or offense involving
one or more victims and one or more offenders.
Multistage sampling A survey sampling technique in
which there is more than one wave of sampling. That
is, one sample of units is drawn, and then another
sample is drawn within that sample. For example,
at the first stage, a number of Census blocks may be
sampled out of all the Census blocks in the United
States. At the second stage, households are sampled
within the previously sampled Census blocks.
Prevalence The percentage of the population directly
affected by crime in a given period. This rate is based
upon specific information elicited directly from the
respondent regarding crimes committed against his
or her person, against his or her property, or against
an individual bearing a unique relationship to him
or her. It is not based upon perceptions and beliefs
about, or reactions to, criminal acts.
School An education institution consisting of one or
more of grades K through 12.
School crime Any criminal activity that is committed
on school property.
School year The 12-month period of time denoting
the beginning and ending dates for school accounting
purposes, usually from July 1 through June 30.
Stratification A survey sampling technique in
which the target population is divided into mutually
exclusive groups or strata based on some variable or
variables (e.g., metropolitan area) and sampling of
units occurs separately within each stratum.
Unequal probabilities A survey sampling technique
in which sampled units do not have the same probability of selection into the sample. For example, the
investigator may oversample minority students in
order to increase the sample sizes of minority students.
Minority students would then be more likely than
other students to be sampled.

Homicide An act involving a killing of one person by
another resulting from interpersonal violence.
School-associated violent death A homicide or
suicide in which the fatal injury occurred on the
campus of a functioning elementary or secondary
school in the United States, while the victim was on
the way to or from regular sessions at such a school, or
while the victim was attending or traveling to or from
an official school-sponsored event. Victims included
nonstudents as well as students and staff members.
Suicide An act of taking one’s own life voluntarily
and intentionally.
National Crime Victimization Survey
Aggravated assault Attack or attempted attack with
a weapon, regardless of whether or not an injury
occurs, and attack without a weapon when serious
injury results.
At school (students) Inside the school building, on
school property (school parking area, play area, school
bus, etc.), or on the way to or from school.
Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) Geographic
entities defined by the U.S. Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for use by federal statistical
agencies in collecting, tabulating, and publishing
federal statistics.
Rape Forced sexual intercourse including both
psychological coercion as well as physical force.
Forced sexual intercourse means vaginal, anal, or
oral penetration by the offender(s). Includes attempts
and verbal threats of rape. This category also includes
incidents where the penetration is from a foreign
object, such as a bottle.
Robbery Completed or attempted theft, directly
from a person, of property or cash by force or threat
of force, with or without a weapon, and with or
without injury.
Rural A place not located inside the Metropolitan

Statistical Area (MSA). This category includes a variety of localities, ranging from sparsely populated rural
areas to cities with populations of less than 50,000.
Serious violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery,
or aggravated assault.
Sexual assault A wide range of victimizations,
separate from rape or attempted rape. These crimes
include attacks or attempted attacks generally involving unwanted sexual contact between the victim and
offender. Sexual assault may or may not involve force
and includes such things as grabbing or fondling.
Sexual assault also includes verbal threats.

Serious violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery,
or aggravated assault.
Total victimization Combination of violent victimization and theft. If a student reported an incident of
either type, he or she is counted as having experienced
any victimization. If the student reported having
experienced both, he or she is counted once under
“total victimization.”
Violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, or simple assault.
Youth Risk Behavior Survey

Simple assault Attack without a weapon resulting
either in no injury, minor injury, or an undetermined
injury requiring less than 2 days of hospitalization.
Also includes attempted assault without a weapon.

Illegal drugs Examples of illegal drugs were marijuana, cocaine, inhalants, steroids, or prescription
drugs without a doctor’s permission, heroin, and
methamphetamines.

Suburban A county or counties containing a central
city, plus any contiguous counties that are linked
socially and economically to the central city. On the
data tables, suburban areas are categorized as those
portions of metropolitan areas situated “outside
central cities.”

On school property On school property is included
in the question wording, but was not defined for
respondents.

Theft Completed or attempted theft of property or
cash without personal contact.

Suburban school A school located inside an MSA,
but outside the “central city.”

Urban The largest city (or grouping of cities) in an
MSA.

Urban school A school located inside an MSA and
inside the “central city.”

Victimization A crime as it affects one individual
person or household. For personal crimes, the number
of victimizations is equal to the number of victims involved. The number of victimizations may be greater
than the number of incidents because more than one
person may be victimized during an incident.

Weapon Examples of weapons appearing in the
questionnaire include guns, knives, and clubs.

Victimization rate A measure of the occurrence of
victimizations among a specific population group.
Violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, or simple assault.
School Crime Supplement
At school In the school building, on school property,
on a school bus, or going to or from school.
Gang Street gangs, fighting gangs, crews, or something else. Gangs may use common names, signs,
symbols, or colors. All gangs, whether or not they are
involved in violent or illegal activity, are included.

Statistical Area (MSA).

Schools and Staffing Survey
City A territory inside an urbanized area (defined as
densely settled “cores” with populations of 50,000 or
more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely
settled surrounding areas) and inside a principal city
(defined as a city that contains the primary population and economic center of a metropolitan statistical
area, which, in turn, is defined as one or more contiguous counties that have a “core” area with a large
population nucleus and adjacent communities that
are highly integrated economically or socially with
the core).
Elementary school A school in which the lowest
grade is less than or equal to grade 6 and the highest
grade is less than or equal to grade 8.
Elementary school teachers An elementary school
teacher is one who, when asked for the grades taught,

147

checked: (1) only “ungraded” and was designated as
an elementary teacher on the list of teachers provided
by the school; (2) 6th grade or lower or “ungraded,”
and no grade higher than 6th; (3) 6th grade or lower
and 7th grade or higher, and reported a primary
assignment of prekindergarten, kindergarten, or
general elementary; (4) 7th and 8th grades only, and
reported a primary assignment of prekindergarten,
kindergarten, or general elementary; (5) 6th grade or
lower and 7th grade or higher, and reported a primary
assignment of special education and was designated as
an elementary teacher on the list of teachers provided
by the school; or (6) 7th and 8th grades only, and
reported a primary assignment of special education
and was designated as an elementary teacher on the
list of teachers provided by the school. A teacher
at a school that has grade 6 or lower or one that is
“ungraded” with no grade higher than the 8th.
Instructional level Instructional levels divide
teachers into elementary or secondary based on a
combination of the grades taught, main teaching
assignment, and the structure of the teacher’s class(es).
Those with only ungraded classes are categorized as
elementary level teachers if their main assignment is
early childhood/prekindergarten or elementary, or
they teach either special education in a self-contained
classroom or an elementary enrichment class. All
other teachers with ungraded classes are classified as
secondary level. Among teachers with regularly graded
classes, in general, elementary level teachers teach
any of grades prekindergarten through 5th; report
an early childhood/prekindergarten, elementary,
self-contained special education, or elementary
enrichment main assignment; or are those whose
preponderance of grades taught are kindergarten
through 6th. In general, secondary-level teachers
instruct any of grades 7 through 12 but usually no
grade lower than 5th. They also teach more of grades
7 through 12 than lower level grades.
Rural A territory outside any urbanized area (defined
as densely settled “cores” with populations of 50,000
or more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent
densely settled surrounding areas) or urban cluster
(defined as densely settled “cores” with populations
between 25,000 and 50,000 of Census-defined blocks
with adjacent densely settled surrounding areas).

than prekindergarten, kindergarten, or general
elementary; (3) 9th grade or higher, or 9th grade
or higher and “ungraded”; (4) 7th and 8th grades
only, and reported a primary assignment other than
prekindergarten, kindergarten, general elementary, or
special education; (5) 7th and 8th grades only, and
reported a primary assignment of special education
and was designated as a secondary teacher on the list
of teachers provided by the school; or (6) 6th grade
or lower and 7th grade or higher, or 7th and 8th
grades only, and was not categorized above as either
elementary or secondary.
Suburban A territory outside a principal city (defined
as a city that contains the primary population and
economic center of a metropolitan statistical area,
which, in turn, is defined as one or more contiguous
counties that have a “core” area with a large population nucleus and adjacent communities that are
highly integrated economically or socially with the
