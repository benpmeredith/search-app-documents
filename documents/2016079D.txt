Executive Summary
Introduction
Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for
teaching and learning, free of crime and violence. Any
instance of crime or violence at school not only affects
the individuals involved, but also may disrupt the
educational process and affect bystanders, the school
itself, and the surrounding community (Brookmeyer,
Fanti, and Henrich 2006; Goldstein, Young, and
Boyd 2008).
Establishing reliable indicators of the current state
of school crime and safety across the nation and
regularly updating and monitoring these indicators
are important in ensuring the safety of our nation’s
students. This is the aim of Indicators of School Crime
and Safety.
This report is the 18th in a series of annual publications
produced jointly by the National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES), Institute of Education
Sciences (IES), in the U.S. Department of Education,
and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) in the U.S.
Department of Justice. This report presents the most
recent data available on school crime and student
safety. The indicators in this report are based on
information drawn from a variety of data sources,
including national surveys of students, teachers,
principals, and postsecondary institutions. Sources
include results from the School-Associated Violent
Deaths Study, sponsored by the U.S. Department
of Education, the Department of Justice, and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC);
the National Crime Victimization Survey and School
Crime Supplement to that survey, sponsored by BJS
and NCES, respectively; the Youth Risk Behavior
Survey, sponsored by the CDC; the Schools and
Staffing Survey, School Survey on Crime and Safety,
Fast Response Survey System, EDFacts, and High
School Longitudinal Study of 2009, all sponsored
by NCES; the Supplementary Homicide Reports,
sponsored by the Federal Bureau of Investigation;
the Campus Safety and Security Survey and Civil
Rights Data Collection, both sponsored by the U.S.
Department of Education; and the Census of Juveniles
in Residential Placement, sponsored by the U.S.
Department of Justice. The most recent data collection
for each indicator varied by survey, from 2009 to
2014. Each data source has an independent sample
design, data collection method, and questionnaire
design, or is the result of a universe data collection.
Findings described in this report with comparative
language (e.g., higher, lower, increase, and decrease)
are statistically significant at the .05 level. Additional
information about methodology and the datasets
analyzed in this report may be found in appendix A.

This report covers topics such as victimization, teacher
injury, bullying and cyber-bullying, school conditions,
fights, weapons, availability and student use of drugs
and alcohol, student perceptions of personal safety
at school, and criminal incidents at postsecondary
institutions. Indicators of crime and safety are
compared across different population subgroups and
over time. Data on crimes that occur away from school
are offered as a point of comparison where available.

Key Findings
Preliminary data show that there were 53 schoolassociated violent deaths1 from July 1, 2012, through
June 30, 2013  (Indicator 1). In 2014, among
students ages 12–18, there were about 850,100
nonfatal victimizations at school,2 which included
363,700 theft victimizations3 and 486,400 violent
victimizations (simple assault4 and serious violent
victimizations5) (Indicator 2). During the 2013–14
school year, there were 1.3 million reported discipline
incidents in the United States for reasons related
to alcohol, drugs, violence, or weapons possession
that resulted in a student being removed from the
education setting for at least an entire school day
(Indicator 19). Of the 781 total hate crimes6 reported
on college campuses in 2013, the most common type
of hate crime reported by institutions was destruction,
damage, and vandalism (364 incidents), followed
by intimidation (295 incidents) and simple assault
(89 incidents; Indicator 23).

A “school-associated violent death” is defined as “a homicide,
suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement
officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a
functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States,
while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at
school or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from
an official school-sponsored event.” Victims of school-associated
violent deaths include students, staff members, and others who
are not students or staff members.
2
“At school” includes inside the school building, on school
property, or on the way to or from school.
3
“Theft” includes attempted and completed purse-snatching,
completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed
thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not
include robbery, which involves the threat or use of force and is
classified as a violent crime.
4
“Simple assault” includes threats and attacks without a weapon
or serious injury.
5
“Serious violent victimization” includes the crimes of rape,
sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.
6
A hate crime is a criminal offense that is motivated, in whole
or in part, by the perpetrator’s bias against the victim(s) based
on their race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender,
or  disability.

The following key findings are drawn from each section
of the report.

between July 1, 2012, and June 30, 2013, there
were 41  homicides, 11 suicides, and 1  legal
intervention death.7  Of these 53 deaths, there
were 31 homicides, 6  suicides, and 1 legal
intervention death of school-age youth (ages
5–18) at school (Indicator 1).

Spotlights

x

The percentage of students who had ever been
suspended or expelled was higher for fall 2009
ninth-graders who did not complete high school
by 2013 than for fall 2009 ninth-graders who did
complete high school by 2013 (54 vs. 17 percent;
Spotlight 1).

x

A higher percentage of Black students (36 percent)
than of Hispanic (21 percent), White (14  percent),
and Asian students (6 percent) had ever been
suspended or expelled from school (Spotlight 1).

x

A greater percentage of students of low socioeconomic status (SES) than of students of middle
SES had ever been suspended or expelled (29 vs.
17 percent), and both of these percentages were
greater than the percentage of high-SES students
who had ever been suspended or expelled (9
percent; Spotlight 1).

x

The percentage of students with low school
engagement who had ever been suspended
or expelled (28 percent) was higher than the
percentage of students with middle or high
levels of school engagement who had ever been
suspended or expelled (21 percent and 9 percent,
respectively). Similarly, the percentage of students
with a low sense of school belonging who had
ever been suspended or expelled (28 percent)
was higher than the percentage of students with
a middle or high sense of school belonging who
had ever been suspended or expelled (16 percent
and 15 percent, respectively; Spotlight 1).

x

Between 1997 and 2013, the 1-day count of
juvenile offenders in residential placement
facilities that house such offenders fell by nearly
50 percent, from approximately 105,000 to
54,000 (Spotlight 2).

x

The rate of residential placement for Black male
juvenile offenders in 2013 was 1.6 times the rate
for American Indian/Alaska Native males, 2.7
times the rate for Hispanic males, 5 times the
rate for White males, and over 16 times the rate
for Asian males (Spotlight 2).

x

In 2013, 32 percent of juvenile offenders were
housed in state-run residential placement
facilities, with an additional 32  percent in
private facilities and 36 percent in local facilities
(Spotlight 2).

school-associated violent deaths occurring

Executive Summary

x

During the 2012–13 school year, 31 of the 1,186
homicides among school-age youth occurred
at school. 8 During the same period, there
were 6  suicides of school-age youth at school,
compared with 1,590 total suicides of schoolage youth that occurred in calendar year 2012
(Indicator 1).

Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization

x

In 2014, among students ages 12–18, there were
about 850,100 nonfatal victimizations at school,9
which included 363,700 theft victimizations10
and 486,400 violent victimizations (simple
assault11 and serious violent victimizations12)
(Indicator 2).

x

In 2014, students ages 12–18 experienced
33  nonfatal victimizations per 1,000 students
at school and 24 per 1,000 students away from
school (Indicator 2).

x

In 2014, students residing in rural areas
had higher rates of total victimization at
school (53  victimizations per 1,000 students)
than students residing in suburban areas
(28  victimizations per 1,000 students). These
differences were primarily driven by higher rates
of violent victimization at school among students
living in rural areas. In the same year, the rate of
total victimization at school for students residing
in urban areas was 32 victimizations per 1,000
students (Indicator 2).

7

A legal intervention death is defined as a death caused by
police and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force,
excluding legal executions.
8
This finding is drawn from the School-Associated Violent
Deaths Study (SAVD), which defines “at school” for survey
respondents as on school property, on the way to or from regular
sessions at school, and while attending or traveling to or from a
school-sponsored event.
9
This finding is drawn from the National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS), which defines “at school” for survey respondents
as inside the school building, on school property, or on the way
to or from school.
10
“Theft” includes attempted and completed purse-snatching,
completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed
thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not
include robbery, which involves the threat or use of force and is
classified as a violent crime.
11
“Simple assault” includes threats and attacks without a
weapon or serious injury.
12
“Serious violent victimization” includes the crimes of rape,
sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.

Between 1992 and 2014, the total victimization
rate at school declined 82 percent, from
181 victimizations per 1,000 students in 1992
to 33 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2014.
The total victimization rate away from school
declined 86 percent, from 173 victimizations per
1,000 students in 1992 to 24 victimizations per
1,000 students in 2014 (Indicator 2).
In 2013, approximately 3 percent of students
ages 12–18 reported being victimized at school
during the previous 6 months. Two percent
of students reported theft, 1 percent reported
violent victimization, and less than one-half of
1 percent reported serious violent victimization
(Indicator 3).
Between 1995 and 2013, the percentage of
students ages 12–18 who reported being victimized
at school during the previous 6 months decreased
overall (from 10 to 3 percent), as did the
percentages of students who reported theft (from
7 to 2 percent), violent victimization (from 3
to 1 percent), and serious violent victimization
(from 1 percent to less than one-half of 1 percent;
Indicator 3).
About 7 percent of students in grades 9–12
reported being threatened or injured with a
weapon such as a gun, knife, or club on school
property13 in 2013. The percentage of students
who reported being threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property has decreased over the
last decade, from 9 percent in 2003 to 7 percent
in 2013 (Indicator 4).
In each survey year from 1993 to 2013, a higher
percentage of males than of females in grades
9–12 reported being threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property. In 2013,
approximately 8 percent of males and 6 percent of
females reported being threatened or injured with
a weapon on school property. The percentage of
males who reported being threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property was lower in
2013 than in 2011 (8 vs. 10 percent); however,
the percentages for females were not measurably
different between these two years (Indicator 4).
In 2013, a higher percentage of students in grades
9–12 reported being threatened or injured with
a weapon on school property 1 time (3 percent)
than reported being threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property 2 or 3 times
(2 percent), 4 to 11 times (1 percent), or 12 or
more times (1 percent; Indicator 4).
“On school property” was not defined for survey respondents.

x

During the 2011–12 school year, a higher
percentage of public than private school
teachers reported being threatened with injury
(10 vs. 3 percent) or being physically attacked
(6 vs. 3 percent) by a student from their school
(Indicator 5).

x

Ten percent of elementary teachers and 9 percent
of secondary teachers reported being threatened
by a student from their school in 2011–12. The
percentage of elementary teachers who reported
being physically attacked by a student was
higher than the percentage of secondary teachers
(8 vs. 3 percent; Indicator 5).

School Environment

x

During the 2013–14 school year, 65 percent of
public schools recorded that one or more incidents
of violence had taken place, amounting to an
estimated 757,000 crimes. This figure translates
to a rate of approximately 15 crimes per 1,000
students enrolled in 2013–14 (Indicator 6).

x

In 2013–14, about 58 percent of public schools
recorded one or more incidents of a physical
attack or fight without a weapon, 47 percent of
schools recorded one or more incidents of threat of
physical attack without a weapon, and 13 percent
of public schools recorded one or more serious
violent incidents (Indicator 6).

x

Primary schools recorded lower percentages of
violent incidents in 2013–14 (53 percent) than
middle schools (88 percent) and high schools and
combined elementary/secondary schools (referred
to as high/combined schools) (78 percent;
Indicator 6).

x

The percentage of public schools that reported
student bullying occurred at least once a week
decreased from 29 percent in 1999–2000 to
16 percent in 2013–14. Similarly, the percentage
of schools that reported the occurrence of
student verbal abuse of teachers decreased from
13 percent in 1999–2000 to 5 percent in 2013–14
(Indicator 7).

x

The percentage of public schools reporting
student harassment of other students based on
sexual orientation or gender identity was lower in
2013–14 (1 percent) than in 2009–10 (3 percent;
Indicator 7).

x

During the 2013–14 school year, the percentage
of public schools that reported student bullying
occurred at least once a week was higher for middle
schools (25 percent) than high schools/combined
schools (17 percent), and the percentages for
both of these school levels was higher than the
percentage of primary schools (12 percent;
Indicator 7).

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2015

The percentage of students ages 12–18 who
reported that gangs were present at their school
decreased from 18 percent in 2011 to 12 percent in
2013. A higher percentage of students from urban
areas (18 percent) reported a gang presence than
students from suburban (11 percent) and rural

vi

During the 2013–14 school year, the rate of
illicit drug-related discipline incidents was 394
per 100,000 students in the United States. The
majority of states had rates between 100 and 1,000
illicit drug-related discipline incidents per 100,000
students during the 2013–14 school year. Five
states had rates of illicit drug-related discipline
incidents per 100,000 students that were below
100: Wyoming, Texas, Tennessee, Virginia, and
Michigan, while two states had rates above 1,000:
Kentucky and New Mexico (Indicator 9).
The percentage of students ages 12–18 who
reported being the target of hate-related words
decreased from 12 percent in 2001 (the first year of
data collection for this item) to 7 percent in 2013.
The percentage of students who reported being the
target of hate-related words in 2013 was lower than
the percentage in 2011 (9 percent; Indicator 10).
The percentage of students ages 12–18 who
reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school
decreased from 36 percent in 1999 (the first year
of data collection for this item) to 25 percent in
2013. The percentage of students who reported
seeing hate-related graffiti in 2013 was lower than
the percentage in 2011 (28 percent; Indicator 10).

Executive Summary

x

In 2013, a lower percentage of White students
than students of any other race/ethnicity reported
being called a hate-related word during the school
year. About 5 percent of White students reported
being called a hate-related word, compared with
7   percent of Hispanic students, 8 percent of
Black students, 10 percent of Asian students, and
11 percent of students of other races/ethnicities.
There were no measurable differences by race/
ethnicity, however, in the percentages of students
who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school
in 2013 (Indicator 10).

x

In 2013, about 22 percent of students ages 12–18
reported being bullied at school during the school
year. Higher percentages of females than of males
reported that they were made fun of, called names,
or insulted (15 vs. 13 percent); were the subject
of rumors (17 vs. 10 percent); and were excluded
from activities on purpose (5 vs. 4 percent). In
contrast, a higher percentage of males (7 percent)
than of females (5 percent) reported being pushed,
shoved, tripped, or spit on (Indicator 11).

x

In 2013, approximately 7 percent of students ages
12–18 reported being cyber-bullied anywhere
during the school year. A higher percentage of
female students than of male students reported
being victims of cyber-bullying overall (9 vs.
5  percent; Indicator 11).

x

In 2013, about 33 percent of students who
reported being bullied at school indicated that
they were bullied at least once or twice a month
during the school year, and about 27 percent
of students who reported being cyber-bullied
anywhere indicated that they were cyber-bullied at
least once or twice a month. A higher percentage
of students reported notifying an adult after being
bullied at school than after being cyber-bullied
anywhere (39 vs. 23 percent; Indicator 11).

x

The percentage of students who reported being
bullied was lower in 2013 (22 percent) than
in every prior survey year (28 percent each in
2005, 2009, and 2011 and 32 percent in 2007).
The same pattern was observed across many of
the student and school characteristics examined
(Indicator 11).

x

In 2011–12, about 38 percent of teachers agreed
or strongly agreed that student misbehavior
interfered with their teaching, and 35 percent
reported that student tardiness and class cutting
interfered with their teaching. Sixty-nine percent
of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that other
teachers at their school enforced the school
rules, and 84 percent reported that the principal
enforced the school rules (Indicator 12).

x

x

The percentage of teachers who reported that
student misbehavior interfered with their teaching
fluctuated between 1993–94 and 2011–12;
however, the percentage of teachers reporting
that student tardiness and class cutting interfered
with their teaching increased over this time period
(from 25 to 35 percent). Between 1993–94
and 2011–12, the percentage of teachers who
reported that school rules were enforced by other
teachers fluctuated between 64 and 73 percent,
and the percentage who reported that rules were
enforced by the principal fluctuated between 82
and 89 percent (Indicator 12).
A higher percentage of public school teachers
(41 percent) than of private school teachers
(22 percent) reported that student misbehavior
interfered with their teaching in 2011–12. In
addition, 38 percent of public school teachers
reported that student tardiness and class cutting
interfered with their teaching, compared with
19 percent of private school teachers. During
the same year, lower percentages of public school
teachers than of private school teachers agreed
that school rules were enforced by other teachers
(68 vs. 77 percent) and by the principal in their
school (84 vs. 89 percent; Indicator 12).

7  percent of students in these grades reported
being in a physical fight on school property 1 to
3 times, 1 percent reported being in a physical
fight on school property 4 to 11 times, and less
than 1 percent reported being in a physical fight

Between 1993 and 2013, the percentage of
students in grades 9–12 who reported having at
least one drink of alcohol during the previous
30 days decreased from 48 to 35 percent
(Indicator 15).

x

In 2013, about 47 percent of 12th-graders
reported consuming alcohol on at least 1 day
during the previous 30 days. This percentage
was higher than the percentages for 9th-graders
(24  percent), 10th-graders (31 percent), and
11th-graders (39 percent; Indicator 15).

x

During the 2013–14 school year, the rate of
alcohol-related discipline incidents was 48 per
100,000 students in the United States. The
majority of states had rates between 10 and 100
alcohol-related discipline incidents per 100,000
students during the 2013–14 school year. Texas
and Wyoming had rates of alcohol-related
discipline incidents per 100,000 students that
were at or below 10. Tennessee, Montana, and
Washington had rates above 100 (Indicator 15).

x

In 2013, some 23 percent of students in grades
9–12 reported using marijuana at least one
time in the previous 30 days, which was a
higher percentage than that reported in 1993
(18 percent) but not measurably different from
that reported in 2011 (Indicator 16).

Fights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances

x

In 2013, about 25 percent of students in grades
9–12 reported that they had been in a physical
fight anywhere during the previous 12 months,
and 8 percent reported that they had been in a
physical fight on school property during this time
period (Indicator 13).

x

The percentage of students in grades 9–12 who
reported being in a physical fight anywhere
decreased between 1993 and 2013 (from 42 to 25
percent), and the percentage of students in these
grades who reported being in a physical fight on
school property also decreased during this period
(from 16 to 8 percent; Indicator 13).

x

x

In 2013, a lower percentage of 12th-graders
than of 9th-, 10th-, and 11th-graders reported
being in a physical fight, either anywhere or on
school property during the previous 12 months.
Higher percentages of Black students than of
students of Two or more races, Hispanic students,
Pacific Islander students, White students, and
Asian students reported being in a physical fight
anywhere or on school property during this time
period (Indicator 13).
In 2013, about 19 percent of students in grades
9–12 reported being in a physical fight anywhere
1 to 3 times, 4 percent reported being in a physical
fight anywhere 4 to 11 times, and 2 percent
reported being in a physical fight anywhere 12 or

In every survey year between 1993 and 2011,
higher percentages of male students than of
female students reported using marijuana at
least one time in the previous 30 days; in 2013,
however, there was no measurable difference in the
percentages reported by male and female students
(25 and 22 percent, respectively; Indicator 16).
In 2013, the percentages of Asian students
(16  percent) and White students (20 percent)
who reported using marijuana at least one time
during the previous 30 days were lower than
the percentages reported by Hispanic students
(28 percent), Black students and students of Two
or more races (29 percent each), and American
Indian/Alaska Native students (36 percent;
Indicator 16).
In 2011, some 6 percent of students reported
using marijuana at least one time on school
property, which was not measurably different
from the percentage in 1993. In every survey year
between 1993 and 2011, higher percentages of
male students than of female students reported
using marijuana on school property at least one
time in the previous 30 days (Indicator 16).

the previous school year because they feared being
attacked or harmed.16 Specifically, 2 percent of
students reported avoiding at least one school
activity or class, and 4 percent reported avoiding
one or more places in school (Indicator 18).

Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures

x

During the 2011–12 school year, 3.4 million
public school students in the United States
received in-school suspensions and 3.2 million
received out-of-school suspensions (Indicator 19).

x

During the 2011–12 school year, the percentage
of Black students receiving out-of-school
suspensions (15 percent) was higher than the
percentages for students of any other racial/
ethnic group. In contrast, a lower percentage of
Asian students (1 percent) received out-of-school
suspensions than students from any other racial/
ethnic group (Indicator 19).

x

During the 2013–14 school year, there were
1.3 million reported discipline incidents in the
United States for reasons related to alcohol, drugs,
violence, or weapons possession that resulted in
a student being removed from the education
setting for at least an entire school day. About 78
percent of these discipline incidents were violent
incidents with or without physical injury, 15
percent were illicit drug related, 5 percent were
weapons possessions, and 2 percent were alcohol
related (Indicator 19).

x

Higher percentages of high/combined schools
and middle schools than of primary schools
reported the enforcement of a strict dress code; a
requirement that students wear badges or picture
IDs; and the use of random metal detector
checks in 2013–14. Additionally, a higher
percentage of high/combined schools reported
the use of security cameras to monitor the school
(89  percent) than middle schools (84 percent),
and both these percentages were higher than the
percentage of primary schools (67 percent) that
reported the use of security cameras (Indicator 20).

Fear and Avoidance

x

x

x

The percentage of students who reported being
afraid of attack or harm at school or on the way
to and from school decreased from 12 percent in
1995 to 3 percent in 2013, and the percentage of
students who reported being afraid of attack or
harm away from school decreased from 6 percent
in 1999 to 3 percent in 2013 (Indicator 17).
In 2013, higher percentages of Black and Hispanic
students than of White students reported being
afraid of attack or harm both at school and away
from school. Additionally, higher percentages
of students in urban areas than of students in
suburban areas reported being afraid of attack
or harm both at school and away from school
(Indicator 17).
In 2013, about 5 percent of students reported
that they avoided at least one school activity or
class14 or one or more places in school15 during

14
“Avoided school activities or classes” includes student reports
of three activities: avoiding any (extracurricular) activities,
avoiding any classes, or staying home from school. Before 2007,
students were asked whether they avoided “any extracurricular
activities.” Starting in 2007, the survey wording was changed
to “any activities.” Caution should be used when comparing
changes in this item over time.
15
“Avoiding one or more places in school” includes student
reports of five activities: avoiding the entrance, any hallways or
stairs, parts of the cafeteria, restrooms, and other places inside
the school building.

viii

Executive Summary

A higher percentage of Hispanic students
(5 percent) than of White students (3 percent)
reported avoiding one or more places in school in
2013. In addition, a higher percentage of public
school students (4 percent) than of private school
students (1 percent) reported avoiding one or
more places in school (Indicator 18).

16

For the 2001 survey only, the wording was changed
from “attack or harm” to “attack or threaten to attack.” See
appendix A for more information.

From 1999–2000 to 2013–14, the percentage
of public schools reporting the use of security
cameras increased from 19 percent to 75 percent.
Similarly, the percentage of public schools
reporting that they controlled access to school
buildings increased from 75 percent to 93 percent
during this time (Indicator 20).

x

In the 2013–14 school year, about 88 percent of
public schools reported they had a written plan
for procedures to be performed in the event of a
shooting, and 70 percent of those schools with a
plan had drilled students on the use of the plan
(Indicator 20).

x

In 2013, nearly all students ages 12–18 reported
that they observed the use of at least one of the
selected security measures at their schools. Most
students ages 12–18 reported that their schools
had a written code of student conduct and a
requirement that visitors sign in (96 percent each).
Approximately 90 percent of students reported
the presence of school staff (other than security
guards or assigned police officers) or other adults
supervising the hallway, 77 percent reported
the presence of one or more security cameras
to monitor the school, and 76 percent reported
locked entrance or exit doors during the day.
Eleven percent of students reported the use of
metal detectors at their schools, representing the
least observed of the selected safety and security
measures (Indicator 21).

x

However, the number of reported forcible
sex crimes on campus increased during this
period, from 2,200 in 2001 to 5,000 in 2013
(a 126 percent increase; Indicator 22).

x

The number of disciplinary referrals for drug law
violations reported by postsecondary institutions
increased between 2001 and 2013 (from 23,900
to 54,100 for a 127 percent increase). The number
of referrals for liquor law violations also increased
from 130,000 in 2001 to 190,900 in 2013
(a 47 percent increase). The number of referrals
for illegal weapons possession was lower in 2013
(1,400) than in 2006 (1,900), but it was higher
than the number of such referrals in 2001 (1,300;
Indicator 22).

x

The number of arrests for illegal weapons
possession reported by postsecondary institutions
was 3 percent lower in 2013 than in 2001
(1,000 vs. 1,100). Arrests for drug law violations
increased by 70 percent during this period, from
11,900 in 2001 to 20,100 in 2013. The number of
arrests for liquor law violations in 2013 (26,600)
was lower than in any year between 2001 and
2012 (Indicator 22).

x

Of the 781 total hate crimes reported on college
campuses in 2013, the most common type of hate
crime reported by institutions was destruction,
damage, and vandalism (364   incidents;
also referred to as “vandalism”), followed by
intimidation (295 incidents), simple assault
(89 incidents), larceny (15 incidents), forcible
sex offenses (7 incidents), aggravated assault
(6 incidents), burglary (4 incidents), and robbery
(1 incident). Similarly, vandalism, intimidation,
and simple assault were the three most common
types of hate crimes reported by institutions from
2009 to 2012 (Indicator 23).

x

Race-related hate crimes accounted for 41 percent
of reported vandalisms classified as hate crimes,
37 percent of reported intimidations, and
38 percent of reported simple assaults in 2013.
Additionally, 31 percent of vandalism hate crimes,
23 percent of intimidations, and 29 percent
of simple assaults were associated with sexual
orientation as the motivating bias (Indicator 23).

About 76 percent of students ages 12–18 reported
observing locked entrance or exit doors during
the day in 2013, representing an increase from
65 percent in 2011 as well as an overall increase
from 38 percent in 1999 (Indicator 21).

Postsecondary Campus Safety and Security

x

In 2013, there were 27,600 criminal incidents
on campuses at postsecondary institutions that
were reported to police and security agencies,
representing an 8 percent decrease from 2012
(29,800 incidents). The number of on-campus
crimes per 10,000 full-time-equivalent students
also decreased, from 19.8 in 2012 to 18.4 in
2013 (Indicator 22).

x

Between 2001 and 2013, the overall number of
crimes reported by postsecondary institutions
decreased by 34 percent, from 41,600 to 27,600.

Foreword
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2015 provides the
most recent national indicators on school crime and
safety. The information presented in this report serves
as a reference for policymakers and practitioners so
that they can develop effective programs and policies
aimed at violence and school crime prevention.
Accurate information about the nature, extent, and
scope of the problem being addressed is essential for
developing effective programs and policies.
This is the 18th edition of Indicators of School Crime
and Safety, a joint publication of the Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS) and the National Center for Education
Statistics (NCES). This report provides detailed
statistics to inform the nation about current aspects
of crime and safety in schools.
The 2015 edition of Indicators of School Crime
and Safety includes the most recent available data,
compiled from a number of statistical data sources
supported by the federal government. Such sources
include results from the School-Associated Violent
Deaths Study, sponsored by the U.S. Department
of Education, the Department of Justice, and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC); the National Crime Victimization Survey
and School Crime Supplement to the survey,
sponsored by BJS and NCES, respectively; the Youth

Risk Behavior Survey, sponsored by the CDC; the
Schools and Staffing Survey, School Survey on Crime
and Safety, Fast Response Survey System, EDFacts,
and High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, all
sponsored by NCES; the Supplementary Homicide
Reports, sponsored by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation; the Campus Safety and Security Survey
and Civil Rights Data Collection, both sponsored by
the U.S. Department of Education; and the Census
of Juveniles in Residential Placement, sponsored by
the U.S. Department of Justice.
The entire report is available on the Internet (http://
nces.ed.gov/programs/crimeindicators/). The Bureau
of Justice Statistics and the National Center for
Education Statistics continue to work together in
order to provide timely and complete data on the
issues of school-related violence and safety.

Introduction

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2015

1

Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for
teaching and learning free of crime and violence.
Any instance of crime or violence at school not only
affects the individuals involved but also may disrupt
the educational process and affect bystanders, the
school itself, and the surrounding community
(Brookmeyer, Fanti, and Henrich 2006; Goldstein,
Young, and Boyd 2008). For both students and
teachers, victimization at school can have lasting
effects. In addition to experiencing loneliness,
depression, and adjustment difficulties (Crick and
Bigbee 1998; Crick and Grotpeter 1996; Nansel et al.
2001; Prinstein, Boergers, and Vernberg 2001; Storch
et al. 2003), victimized children are more prone to
truancy (Ringwalt, Ennett, and Johnson 2003),
poor academic performance (MacMillan and Hagan
2004; Wei and Williams 2004), dropping out of
school (Beauvais et al. 1996; MacMillan and Hagan
2004), and violent behaviors (Nansel et al. 2003).
For teachers, incidents of victimization may lead to
professional disenchantment and even departure from
the profession altogether (Karcher 2002; Smith and
Smith 2006).
For parents, school staff, and policymakers to
effectively address school crime, they need an accurate
understanding of the extent, nature, and context of
the problem. However, it is difficult to gauge the
scope of crime and violence in schools given the large
amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of
extreme school violence. Measuring progress toward
safer schools requires establishing good indicators of
the current state of school crime and safety across
the nation and regularly updating and monitoring
these indicators; this is the aim of Indicators of School
Crime and Safety.

Purpose and Organization of This Report
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2015 is the
18th in a series of reports produced since 1998
by the National Center for Education Statistics
(NCES) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)
that present the most recent data available on school
crime and student safety. Although the data presented
in this report are the most recent data available at the
time of publication, the data do not cover the most
recent two or more school years. The report is not
intended to be an exhaustive compilation of school
2

Introduction

crime and safety information, nor does it attempt
to explore reasons for crime and violence in schools.
Rather, it is designed to provide a brief summary
of information from an array of data sources and
to make data on national school crime and safety
accessible to policymakers, educators, parents, and
the general public.
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2015 is
organized into sections that delineate specific
concerns to readers, starting with a description of the
most serious violent crimes. The sections cover violent
deaths; nonfatal student and teacher victimization;
school environment; fights, weapons, and illegal
substances; fear and avoidance; discipline, safety, and
security measures; and campus safety and security.
This year’s report also includes a spotlight section on
topics related to student suspension and expulsion and
juvenile offenders in residential placement facilities
that house such offenders. Each section contains a
set of indicators that, taken together, aim to describe
a distinct aspect of school crime and safety. Where
available, data on crimes that occur outside of school
grounds are offered as a point of comparison.1
Supplemental tables for each indicator provide more
detailed breakouts and standard errors for estimates.
A reference section and a glossary of terms appear at
the end of the report.
This edition of the report contains updated data for
eleven indicators: violent deaths at school and away
from school (Indicator 1); incidence of victimization

(Indicator 23). In addition, it includes two spotlight
indicators: suspension and expulsion by student,
family, and academic characteristics (Spotlight 1) and
juveniles in residential placement: youth and facility
characteristics (Spotlight 2).
Also included in this year’s report are references to
publications relevant to each indicator that the reader
may want to consult for additional information
or analyses. These references can be found in the
“For more information” sidebars at the bottom of
each indicator.

Data
The indicators in this report are based on information
drawn from a variety of independent data sources,
including national surveys of students, teachers,
principals, and postsecondary institutions and
universe data collections from federal departments
and agencies, including BJS, NCES, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, the Office of Postsecondary
Education, the Office for Civil Rights, and the Office
of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Each
data source has an independent sample design, data
collection method, and questionnaire design, or is
the result of a universe data collection.
The combination of multiple, independent sources
of data provides a broad perspective on school crime
and safety that could not be achieved through any
single source of information. However, readers
should be cautious when comparing data from
different sources. While every effort has been made
to keep key definitions consistent across indicators,
differences in sampling procedures, populations,
time periods, and question phrasing can all affect
the comparability of results. For example, both
Indicators 20 and 21 report data on selected security
and safety measures used in schools. Indicator 20
uses data collected from a survey of public school
principals about safety and security practices used
in their schools during the 2013–14 school year. The
schools range from primary through high schools.
Indicator 21, however, uses data collected from 12through 18-year-old students residing in a sample of
households. These students were asked whether they
observed selected safety and security measures in

their school in 2013, but they may not have known
whether, in fact, the security measure was present.
In addition, different indicators contain various
approaches to the analysis of school crime data and,
therefore, will show different perspectives on school
crime. For example, both Indicators 2 and 3 report
data on theft and violent victimization at school based
on the National Crime Victimization Survey and the
School Crime Supplement to that survey, respectively.
While Indicator 2 examines the number of incidents
of victimization, Indicator 3 examines the percentage
or prevalence of students who reported victimization.
Table A provides a summary of some of the variations
in the design and coverage of sample surveys used in
this report.
Several indicators in this report are based on selfreported survey data. Readers should note that
limitations inherent to self-reported data may affect
estimates (Addington 2005; Cantor and Lynch 2000).
First, unless an interview is “bounded” or a reference
period is established, estimates may include events
that exceed the scope of the specified reference period.
This factor may artificially increase reported incidents
because respondents may recall events outside of the
given reference period. Second, many of the surveys
rely on the respondent to “self-determine” a condition.
This factor allows the respondent to define a situation
based upon his or her own interpretation of whether
the incident was a crime or not. On the other hand,
the same situation may not necessarily be interpreted
in the same way by a bystander or the perceived
offender. Third, victim surveys tend to emphasize
crime events as incidents that take place at one point
in time. However, victims can often experience a
state of victimization in which they are threatened or
victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally, respondents
may recall an event inaccurately. For instance, people
may forget the event entirely or recall the specifics
of the episode incorrectly. These and other factors
may affect the precision of the estimates based on
these surveys.
Data trends are discussed in this report when possible.
Where trends are not discussed, either the data
are not available in earlier surveys or the wording
of the survey question changed from year to year,
eliminating the ability to discuss any trend.

Where data from samples are reported, as is the
case with most of the indicators in this report, the
standard error is calculated for each estimate provided
in order to determine the “margin of error” for these
estimates. The standard errors of the estimates for
different subpopulations in an indicator can vary
considerably and should be taken into account
when making comparisons. With the exception of
Indicator 2, in this report, in cases where the standard
error was between 30 and 50 percent of the associated
estimate, the estimates were noted with a “!” symbol
(Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of
variation [CV] for this estimate is between 30 and
50 percent). In Indicator 2, the “!” symbol cautions
the reader that estimates marked indicate that the
reported statistic was based on 10 or fewer cases.
With the exception of Indicator 2, in cases where
the standard error was 50 percent or greater of the
associated estimate, the estimate was suppressed
(Reporting standards not met. Either there are too
few cases for a reliable estimate or the coefficient
of variation [CV] is 50 percent or greater). See
appendix A for more information.
The appearance of a “!” symbol (Interpret data with
caution) in a table or figure indicates a data cell with
a high ratio of standard error to estimate so the reader
should use caution when interpreting such data.
These estimates are still discussed, however, when
statistically significant differences are found despite
large standard errors.
Comparisons in the text based on sample survey data
have been tested for statistical significance to ensure
that the differences are larger than might be expected
due to sampling variation. Findings described in this

Introduction

report with comparative language (e.g., higher, lower,
increase, and decrease) are statistically significant at
the .05 level. Comparisons based on universe data
do not require statistical testing, with the exception
of linear trends. Several test procedures were used,
depending upon the type of data being analyzed
and the nature of the comparison being tested.
The primary test procedure used in this report was
Student’s t statistic, which tests the difference between
two sample estimates. The t test formula was not
adjusted for multiple comparisons. Linear trend tests
were used to examine changes in percentages over
a range of values such as time or age. Linear trends
tests allow one to examine whether, for example, the
percentage of students who reported using drugs
increased (or decreased) over time or whether the
percentage of students who reported being physically
attacked in school increased (or decreased) with age.
When differences among percentages were examined
relative to a variable with ordinal categories (such as
grade), analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test
for a linear relationship between the two variables.
Percentages reported in the tables and figures
are generally rounded to one decimal place
(e.g., 76.5 percent), while percentages reported in the
text are generally rounded from the original number
to whole numbers (with any value of 0.50 or above
rounded to the next highest whole number). While
the data labels on the figures have been rounded to
one decimal place, the graphical presentation of these
data is based on the unrounded estimates.
Appendix A of this report contains descriptions of all
the datasets used in this report and a discussion of
how standard errors were calculated for each estimate.

Spotlight 1
Suspension and Expulsion by Student, Family, and Academic
Characteristics
The percentage of students who had ever been suspended or expelled was lower for fall 2009 ninth-graders
who completed high school by 2013 than for fall 2009 ninth-graders who did not complete high school by
2013 (17 percent vs. 54 percent).
Students may be suspended (temporarily removed
from regular school activities in or out of school) or
expelled (permanently removed from school with
no services) for a variety of disciplinary reasons.
Suspensions and expulsions from school are often
associated with negative academic outcomes, such
as lower levels of achievement and higher school
dropout rates (Christle, Nelson, and Jolivette 2004;
Skiba et al. 2002). The timing of school suspensions
or expulsions is also associated with student outcomes.
For example, students’ suspension in elementary or
middle school is associated with a greater likelihood
of being suspended later in school, poor academic
performance, and a lower likelihood of graduating
from high school on time (Raffaele Mendez 2003).
This spotlight examines the characteristics of students
who have ever been suspended or expelled, as well
as academic outcomes for these students. It also
examines differences in students’ characteristics based
on the timing of their suspension or expulsion.
The High School Longitudinal Study of 2009
(HSLS:2009) followed a nationally representative
cohort of ninth-grade students throughout high
school. During the first wave of data, which was
collected from ninth-graders and their parents in the
fall of 2009, parents were asked to report whether

their child had ever been suspended or expelled from
school since starting kindergarten. During the first
follow-up (conducted in the spring of 2012, when
most of the students were in the 11th grade), parents
and their children were surveyed again, and parents
were asked to report on whether their child had been
suspended or expelled since the last data collection.
In addition to examining differences for all students
who had ever been suspended or expelled, this
spotlight examines differences in relation to the
timing of students’ suspensions or expulsions. For
this spotlight, students who were ever suspended
or expelled are categorized into three different
groups depending on the time period in which their
suspension or expulsion occurred. One group consists
of those who were suspended or expelled only before
fall 2009 (in the spotlight, this group is described
as being made up of those who were suspended or
expelled only in the “early time period”). A second
group consists of those who were suspended or
expelled only between fall 2009 and spring 2012 (in
the spotlight, this group is described as being made
up of those who were suspended or expelled only in
the “late time period”). A third group consists of those
who were suspended or expelled in both time periods.

This spotlight indicator features data on a selected issue of current policy interest. For more information: Table S1.1, and

The percentage of fall 2009 ninth-graders who, by
spring 2012, had ever been suspended or expelled
from school was about 19 percent (table S1.1 and
figure S1.1). There were no measurable differences
between the percentages of students who had ever
been suspended or expelled in terms of the time
period during which they were suspended or expelled
(7 percent were suspended or expelled only in the early
time period, 7 percent were suspended or expelled
only in the late time period, and 6 percent were
suspended or expelled in both time periods).

A higher percentage of males (26 percent) than of
females (13 percent) were ever suspended or expelled.
There were no measurable differences between the
percentages of male students who were suspended
or expelled only in the early time period, only in the
late time period, or in both time periods. For female
students who had ever been suspended or expelled,
however, higher percentages were suspended or
expelled only in the early time period (5 percent) and
only in the late time period (5 percent) than in both
time periods (3 percent).

A higher percentage of Black students (36 percent)
than of Hispanic (21 percent), White (14 percent),
and Asian students (6 percent) had ever been
suspended or expelled (figure S1.2 and table S1.1).
Additionally, a higher percentage of students of Two

Data on the characteristics of students’ families, such
as their parents’ highest level of education and their
families’ socioeconomic status, were also collected as
part of the HSLS:2009 study, and the percentage of
students who had ever been suspended or expelled
varied according to these characteristics. For example,
of students whose parents’ highest level of education
was high school completion or less, 27 percent had
ever been suspended or expelled (figure S1.3 and
table S1.1). Of students whose parents’ highest level
of education exceeded high school completion, the
percentages who had ever been suspended or expelled

were lower (21 percent for students whose parents had
some college, 13 percent for students whose parents
had a bachelor’s degree, and 10 percent for students
whose parents had a master’s or higher degree). A
greater percentage of students of low socioeconomic
status (SES) than of students of middle SES had
ever been suspended or expelled (29 vs. 17 percent),
and both of these percentages were greater than the
percentage of high-SES students who had ever been
suspended or expelled (9 percent).2

Socioeconomic status (SES) was measured by a composite
score on parental education and occupations, and family income
at the time of data collection. Students living in households in
the highest 20 percent of the SES scale were identified as being
from high-SES households, those living in households in the
middle 40 percent of the SES scale were identified as being from
middle-SES households, and those living in households in the
lowest 40 percent of the SES scale were identified as being from
low-SES households.

A school engagement scale was constructed based on students’ responses to questions about how frequently they went to class without homework
done, without pencil or paper, without books, or late. Students’ school engagement is considered low if they were in the bottom quarter of the scale
distribution, middle if they were in the middle two quarters, and high if they were in the highest quarter.

A school belonging scale was constructed based on the extent to which students agreed or disagreed that they felt safe at school, that they felt
proud of being part of the school, that there were always teachers or other adults at school they could talk to if they had a problem, that school was
often a waste of time, and that getting good grades was important to them. Students’ sense of school belonging is considered low if they were in the
bottom quarter of the scale distribution, middle if they were in the middle two quarters, and high if they were in the highest quarter.

Research shows that students’ attitudes toward
school are associated with their academic outcomes
(Morrison et al. 2002), and that schools with a
supportive climate have lower rates of delinquency,
including suspensions and expulsions (Christle,
Jolivette, and Nelson 2005). As part of the HSLS:2009
data collection, students reported on their school
engagement and sense of school belonging in the
fall of their ninth-grade year. School engagement
measured how frequently students went to class
without homework done, without pencil or paper,
without books, or late.3 The percentage of students
with low school engagement who had ever been
suspended or expelled (28 percent) was higher than
the percentage of students with middle or high levels
of school engagement who had ever been suspended

or expelled (21 percent and 9 percent, respectively;
figure S1.4 and table S1.1). Sense of school belonging
was measured based on the extent to which students
agreed or disagreed that they felt safe at school, that
they felt proud of being part of the school, that there
were always teachers or other adults at school they
could talk to if they had a problem, that school was
often a waste of time, and that getting good grades
was important to them.4 The percentage of students
with a low sense of school belonging who had ever
been suspended or expelled (28 percent) was higher
than the percentage of students with a middle or
high sense of school belonging who had ever been
suspended or expelled (16 percent and 15 percent,
respectively).

Students’ sense of school belonging is considered low if they

In 2013 (after most fall 2009 ninth-graders had
completed high school), students’ high school
transcripts were obtained. In addition, students and
their parents were asked about students’ high school
completion status. The percentages of students who
had ever been suspended or expelled were higher
for those students with lower grade point averages
(GPAs). About 46 percent of students with a GPA
below 1.99 had ever been suspended or expelled,

compared with 28 percent of students with a GPA
of 2.00–2.49, 18 percent of students with a GPA of
2.50–2.99, 8 percent of students with a GPA of 3.00–
3.49, and 3 percent of students with a GPA of 3.50
or above (figure S1.5 and table S1.1). Also, a higher
percentage of students who had not completed high
school by 2013 than of students who had completed
high school by 2013 had ever been suspended or
expelled (54 vs. 17 percent).

Juveniles in Residential Placement: Youth and Facility
Characteristics
The rate of residential placement for Black males in 2013 was 804 per 100,000, which was 1.6 times the
rate for American Indian/Alaska Native males (496 per 100,000), 2.7 times the rate for Hispanic males
(296 per 100,000), 5 times the rate for White males (162 per 100,000), and over 16 times the rate for
Asian/Pacific Islander males (49 per 100,000).
Juvenile offenders held in residential placement
facilities often lack the necessary services and
supports that can help them to develop skills,
encourage learning, and lead to successful academic
performance (U.S. Departments of Education and
Justice 2014). The experiences of these youth during
placement and following their reentry into the
community are frequently characterized by high rates
of reoffending, lower educational attainment, and
negative employment outcomes (Aizer and Doyle
2015; Apel and Sweeten 2009; Hjalmarsson 2008;
The Pew Charitable Trusts 2015; Solomon 2012).
These juveniles often experience disruptions to their
education as they pass in and out of traditional
schooling. While most facilities provide middleschool- and high-school-level educational services
(Hockenberry, Sickmund, and Sladky 2013), these
services are generally not comparable to those available
to their peers in the community (The Council of State
Governments Justice Center 2015). Students who
exit residential facilities also face challenges related
to reenrollment, transfer of academic records, and
acceptance of credits when they attempt to reenter
the traditional education system (Feierman, Levick,
and Mody 2009/10).
The Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement
(CJRP) is a biennial survey of all secure and nonsecure
residential placement facilities that house juvenile
offenders, defined as persons younger than 21 who are
held in a residential setting as a result of some contact
with the justice system (i.e., being charged with or
adjudicated for an offense). The CJRP provides a
1-day count of the number of youth in residential
placement, as well as data on the characteristics of
youth in these facilities and information about the
facilities themselves. The census does not include adult
prisons, jails, federal facilities, or facilities exclusively
for drug or mental health treatment or for abused or
neglected youth.
Between 1997 and 2013, the number of youth
in residential placement facilities fell by nearly
50 percent, from approximately 105,000 to just over
54,000 (figure S2.1 and table S2.1). The number of
youth in these facilities declined for both males and

females, and the ratio of males to females did not
change measurably between 1997 and 2013. In each
of the nine years in which the CJRP was conducted,
there were approximately 6 times as many males as
females in residential facilities.
The decline in residential placements between
1997 and 2013 was also observed for White, Black,
Hispanic, Asian, Pacific Islander, and American
Indian/Alaska Native youth. The number of
residential placements declined by about one-third
for Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native
youth; by about one-half for White, Black, and Pacific
Islander youth; and by more than three-fourths for
Asian youth.
It is also important to examine the residential
placement rate, which is the number of juvenile
offenders in residential facilities per 100,000 youth
in the general population. This rate provides a more
comparable measurement across time because it
accounts for population growth and demographic
changes. The overall residential placement rate fell
from 356 per 100,000 youth in 1997 to 173 per
100,000 in 2013 (figure S2.2 and table S2.2). The
residential placement rate for White youth fell from
201 to 100 per 100,000 during the same period, while
the rate for Black youth fell from 968 to 464 per
100,000. Between 1997 and 2013, rates for American
Indian/Alaska Native youth fell from 490 to 334 per
100,000, rates for Hispanic youth fell from 468 to
173 per 100,000, and rates for Asian/Pacific Islander
youth fell from 195 to 28 per 100,000.5
Although residential placement rates per 100,000
youth declined for all racial/ethnic groups, disparities
between racial/ethnic groups persist. In 1997, the
residential placement rate for Black youth was
4.8 times the rate for White youth, and in 2013 it
was 4.6 times the rate for White youth. In 1997, the
rate for Hispanic youth was 2.3 times the rate for
White youth, and in 2013 it was 1.7 times the rate

for White youth. In contrast, the disparity between
American Indian/Alaska Native youth and White
youth was larger in 2013 than in 1997. The American
Indian/Alaska Native rate was 2.4 times the White
rate in 1997 and 3.3 times the White rate in 2013.
In 1997, residential placement rates were similar for
White and Asian/Pacific Islander youth. However,
residential placement rates declined more sharply for
Asian/Pacific Islander youth than for White youth.
As a result, in 2013 the residential placement rate
for Asian/Pacific Islander youth was approximately
one-quarter of the rate for White youth.
The residential placement rate per 100,000 youth
was also considerably higher for Black males than
for males or females of any other racial/ethnic group.
The rate of residential placement for Black males in
2013 was 804 per 100,000, which was 1.6 times
the rate for American Indian/Alaska Native males
(496 per 100,000), 2.7 times the rate for Hispanic
males (296 per 100,000), 5 times the rate for White
males (162 per 100,000), and over 16 times the rate
for Asian/Pacific Islander males (49 per 100,000)
(figure S2.3). Black males made up over one-third
(35  percent) of all youth in residential placement
in 2013.

Spotlights

Older youth made up a greater share of juveniles in
residential placement than younger youth in 2013: A
majority (69 percent) were between the ages of 16 and
20, about 30 percent were between the ages of 13 and
15, and 1 percent were age 12 or younger (table S2.1).
In 2013, the number of juveniles in residential
facilities was highest for those being held for offenses
against persons6 (19,922, or 37 percent of all juveniles
held) and second highest for those being held for
offenses against property7 (12,768, or 24 percent). The
number in residential facilities was 9,316 (17 percent)
for those being held for technical violations, such as
violations of probation, parole, or valid court order;
6,085 (11 percent) for those being held for offenses
against the public order;8 and 3,533 (7 percent) for

Offenses against property, or property offenses, include arson,
auto theft, burglary, theft, and other offenses such as vandalism,
trespassing, and selling stolen property.

those being held for drug offenses. A total of 2,524
juvenile offenders (5 percent) were being held for
status offenses, which are actions that are illegal for
underage persons but not for adults.9
Between 1997 and 2013, the largest percentage
declines in the number of juveniles in residential
placement were observed for those being held for drug
offenses (61 percent), status offenses (60 percent), and
offenses against property (60 percent). Percentage
declines over the period were smaller for juveniles
being held for offenses against the public order
(41 percent) and offenses against persons (43 percent).
Juvenile residential placements for technical violations
were 25 percent lower in 2013 than in 1997.
Residential placement facilities vary by size, operational
control, and classification. The percentage of juveniles
in residential placement who were in the largest size
facilities (201 or more residents) declined from 35 to
13 percent between 1997 and 2013. In 2013, most
juveniles in residential placement were either in a
facility of 21 to 50 residents (27 percent) or a facility
of 51 to 150 residents (36 percent).
In 1997, about 44 percent of juveniles were held in
facilities operated by state government agencies, with
the remainder split evenly between facilities operated
9

Examples include curfew violation, running away, truancy,
and underage drinking.

by local government agencies and facilities operated by
private entities (28 percent each; figure S2.4 and table
S2.1). In 2013, the share of juveniles in state facilities
had declined to 32 percent, with an additional
32  percent in private facilities and 36  percent in
local facilities.
Juveniles may be placed in a wide range of facility
types, including detention centers, shelters, reception/
diagnostic centers, group homes, boot camps, ranch/
wilderness camps, residential treatment centers, and
long-term secure facilities. Over time, detention
centers and long-term secure facilities have held the
largest numbers of youth.10 In 2013, detention centers
held 36 percent of the youth in residential placement
and long-term secure facilities held 27 percent.
Data on residential treatment centers first became
available in the 2003 CJRP. Since then, this facility
type has contained the third-largest number of youth,
accounting for 23 percent of juveniles in residential
placement in 2013. About 8 percent of youth were
held in group homes in 2013, and 2 percent or less of
youth were held in each of the following facility types:
ranch/wilderness camp, shelter, reception/diagnostic
center, and boot camp.
10

Although respondents were able to select more than one type
for their facility, the data used for this indicator assign each
facility to a single primary type based on an analysis that applies
a hierarchy rule.

Indicator 1
Violent Deaths at School and Away From School
Over all available survey years, the percentage of youth homicides occurring at school remained at less than
3 percent of the total number of youth homicides, and the percentage of youth suicides occurring at school
remained at less than 1 percent of the total number of youth suicides.
Violent deaths at schools are rare but tragic events
with far-reaching effects on the school population
and surrounding community. This indicator
presents data on school-associated violent deaths
that were collected through the School-Associated
Violent Deaths (SAVD) Surveillance System, as
well as data on total suicides collected through the
Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting
System Fatal (WISQARS™ Fatal) and data on total
homicides collected through the Supplementary
Homicide Reports (SHR). The SAVD Surveillance
System defines a school-associated violent death as
“a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention death11
(involving a law enforcement officer), in which the
fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning
elementary or secondary school in the United States.”
School-associated violent deaths include those that
occurred while the victim was on the way to or
returning from regular sessions at school or while
the victim was attending or traveling to or from an
official school-sponsored event. Victims of schoolassociated violent deaths include not only students
and staff members, but also others who are not
students or staff members, such as students’ parents
or community members.
The most recent data released by the SAVD
Surveillance System cover the period from July 1,
2012 through June 30, 2013. During this period,
there were a total of 53 school-associated violent
deaths in elementary and secondary schools in the
United States (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). Of these
53 student, staff, and nonstudent school-associated
violent deaths, there were 41 homicides, 11 suicides,
and 1 legal intervention death.12

11
A legal intervention death is defined as a death caused by
police and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force,
excluding legal executions.
12
Data from 1999–2000 onward are subject to change until
interviews with school and law enforcement officials have
been completed. The details learned during the interviews
can occasionally change the classification of a case. For more
information on this survey, please see appendix A.

Data on violent deaths occurring away from school
were included in order to calculate the percentage
of violent deaths occurring at school. The most
recent data available for total suicides of school-age
youth (ages 5–18; also referred to as “youth” in this
indicator) are for the 2012 calendar year; the most
recent data available for total homicides of youth are
for the 2012–13 school year.13 During the 2012–13
school year, there were 1,186 homicides of youth in
the United States (figure 1.2 and table 1.1). During
the 2012 calendar year, there were 1,590 suicides of
youth. During the 2012–13 school year, there were
31 homicides and 6 suicides of school-age youth at
school (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). When instances of
homicide and suicide of school-age youth at school
were combined, there was approximately 1 homicide
or suicide at school for every 1.5 million students
enrolled.14
The percentage of youth homicides occurring at
school remained at less than 3 percent of the total
number of youth homicides between 1992–93 (when
data collection began) and 2012–13, even though the
absolute number of homicides of school-age youth
at school varied across the years15 (figure 1.1 and
table  1.1). Between 1992–93 and 2012–13, a range
of 1 to 10 school-age youth died by suicide at school
each year, with no consistent pattern of increase or
decrease in the number of suicides. The percentage
of youth suicides occurring at school remained at less
than 1 percent of the total number of youth suicides
over all available survey years.
13

Data on total suicides are from the Web-based Injury Statistics
Query and Reporting System Fatal (WISQARS™ Fatal) and
data on total homicides are from the Supplementary Homicide
Reports (SHR). Data on total suicides are available only by
calendar year, whereas data on suicides and homicides at school
and data on total homicides are available by school year. Due to
these differences in reference periods, please use caution when
comparing total suicides to other categories.
14
The total number of students enrolled in prekindergarten
through 12th grade during the 2012–13 school year was
54,952,269 (Snyder and Dillow 2016).
15
Single incidents occurring at school with a large number of
school-age victims could result in large variations in the number
of homicides of school-age youth at school between two years.
Please use caution when making comparisons over time.

This indicator has been updated to include 2012–13 data for school-associated violent deaths and total youth homicides, and
2012 data for total youth suicides. For more information: Table 1.1, and http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/youthviolence/

A school-associated violent death is defined as “a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal
injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States,” while the victim was on the way to or from
regular sessions at school, or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims include students, staff
members, and others who are not students or staff members, from July 1, 1992, through June 30, 2013.
NOTE: “At school” includes on school property, on the way to or from regular sessions at school, and while attending or traveling to or from a schoolsponsored event. Estimates were revised and may differ from previously published data.

Indicator 2
Incidence of Victimization at School and Away From School16
Between 1992 and 2014, the total victimization rate at school declined 82 percent, from 181 victimizations
per 1,000 students in 1992 to 33 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2014. The total victimization
rate away from school declined 86 percent, from 173 victimizations per 1,000 students in 1992 to
24 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2014.
In 2014, data from the National Crime Victimization
Survey showed that students ages 12–18 experienced
850,100 nonfatal victimizations16(theft17 and violent
victimization18) at school and 621,300 nonfatal
victimizations away from school (table 2.1).19 These
figures represent total crime victimization rates of
33 victimizations per 1,000 students at school and
24 per 1,000 students away from school; these rates
were not measurably different.
For most of the years between 1992 and 2008 as well
as in 2012, the rate of theft at school was higher than
the rate of theft away from school among students
ages 12–18 (figure 2.1). There were no measurable
differences between the rates of theft at school and
away from school in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, or 2014.
The rate of theft at school was 14 thefts per 1,000
students in 2014 and 18 thefts per 1,000 students
in 2013; these rates were not measurably different.
The rate of theft away from school was lower in 2014
(11  thefts per 1,000 students) than in 2013 (16 thefts
per 1,000 students).
Between 1992 and 2000, the rate of violent
victimization per 1,000 students at school was
either lower than or not measurably different from
the rate away from school. Since 2001, the rate of

Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on
similar topics, Indicator 2 is based solely on data collected in
the NCVS, whereas Indicator 3 is based on data collected in
the School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the NCVS as well as
demographic data collected in the NCVS. Indicator 2 uses data
from all students ages 12–18 who responded to the NCVS,
while Indicator 3 uses data from all students ages 12–18 who
responded to both the NCVS and the SCS.
17
“Theft” includes attempted and completed purse-snatching,
completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed
thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not
include robbery, which involves the threat or use of force and is
classified as a violent crime.
18
“Violent victimization” includes serious violent crimes and
simple assault.
19
“Students” refers to youth ages 12–18 whose educational
attainment did not exceed grade 12 at the time of the survey.
An uncertain percentage of these persons may not have attended
school during the survey reference period. These data do not
take into account the number of hours that students spend at
school or away from school. “At school” includes inside the
school building, on school property, and on the way to or from
school.

violent victimization per 1,000 students at school has
generally been higher than or not measurably different
from the rate away from school. In 2014, the rate of
violent victimization was 19 per 1,000 students at
school and 13 per 1,000 students away from school;
these rates were not measurably different. The rate of
simple assault20 at school (15 per 1,000 students) was
higher than away from school (6 per 1,000).
The rate of violent victimization at school was lower
in 2014 (19 violent victimizations per 1,000 students)
than in 2013 (37 violent victimizations per 1,000
students). For violence away from school, the 2014
violent victimization rate did not differ measurably
from the 2013 rate.
The rate of serious violent victimization 21 against
students ages 12–18 was generally lower at school
than away from school in most survey years between
1992 and 2008. Between 2009 and 2014, the rate at
school was not measurably different from the rate
away from school.
The 2014 serious violent victimization rate for
students ages 12–18 did not differ measurably from
the 2013 rate regardless of whether the location of
victimization was at school or away from school. In
2014, students experienced about 4 serious violent
victimizations per 1,000 students at school and
6  serious violent victimizations per 1,000 students
away from school.
Between 1992 and 2014, total victimization rates
for students ages 12–18 generally declined both at
school and away from school (figure 2.1). The total
victimization rate at school declined 82 percent,
from 181 victimizations per 1,000 students in 1992
to 33 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2014. The
total victimization rate away from school declined
86   percent, from 173 victimizations per 1,000
students in 1992 to 24 victimizations per 1,000
students in 2014.
Indicator 2 continued on page 26.

“Simple assault” includes threats and attacks without a
weapon or serious injury.
21
“Serious violent victimization” includes the crimes of rape,
sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.

Serious violent victimization is also included in all violent victimization.
NOTE: Due to methodological changes, use caution when comparing 2006 estimates to other years. “Serious violent victimization” includes the crimes of
rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. “All violent victimization” includes serious violent crimes as well as simple assault. “Theft” includes
attempted and completed purse-snatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts.
Theft does not include robbery, which involves the threat or use of force and is classified as a violent crime. “Total victimization” includes thefts and
violent crimes. “At school” includes inside the school building, on school property, or on the way to or from school. Although Indicators 2 and 3 present
information on similar topics, Indicator 2 is based solely on data collected in National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), whereas Indicator 3 is based
on data collected in the School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the NCVS as well as demographic data collected in the NCVS. Indicator 2 uses data from
all students ages 12–18 who responded to the NCVS, while Indicator 3 uses data from all students ages 12–18 who responded to both the NCVS and
the SCS. The population size for students ages 12–18 was 25,773,800 in 2014. Detail may not sum to totals due to rounding. Estimates may vary from
previously published reports.

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2015

25

This pattern of decline in total victimization rates
both at and away from school between 1992 and 2014
also held for thefts, violent victimizations, and serious
violent victimizations. Thefts at school declined from
a rate of 114 per 1,000 students to 14 per 1,000, and
thefts away from school declined from a rate of 79
thefts per 1,000 students to 11 per 1,000. The rate of
violent victimization at school declined overall from
68 victimizations per 1,000 students in 1992 to 19
per 1,000 in 2014. The rate of violent victimization
away from school declined from 94 victimizations
per 1,000 students in 1992 to 13 per 1,000 in 2014.
Serious violent victimizations at school declined from
8 per 1,000 students in 1992 to 4 per 1,000 in 2014.
The rate of serious violent victimization away from
school declined from 43 victimizations per 1,000
students in 1992 to 6 per 1,000 in 2014.
In 2014, the rates of total victimization, theft,
and violent victimization for males did not differ
measurably from the rates for females; this pattern
held regardless of whether the location of victimization
was at school or away from school. In 2014, the
rate of total victimization at school for males was
35  victimizations per 1,000 students and the rate
for females was 31 victimizations per 1,000 students
(table 2.2 and figure 2.2). The total victimization rate
away from school for males was 25 victimizations
per 1,000 students, and the rate for females was
23 victimizations per 1,000 students. The rate
of violent victimization at school for males was
20  victimizations per 1,000 students, and the rate for
females was 18 victimizations per 1,000 students. The
violent victimization rate away from school for males
was 14 victimizations per 1,000 students, and the rate
for females was 12 victimizations per 1,000 students.

26

Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization

In 2014, the rates of total victimization, theft, and
violent victimization for students ages 12–14 did not
differ measurably from the rates for students ages
15–18; this pattern held regardless of whether the
location of victimization was at school or away from
school. Total victimization rates at school were 34 per
1,000 students ages 12–14 and 32 per 1,000 students
ages 15–18 (table 2.2). Total victimization rates away
from school were 22 per 1,000 students ages 12–14
and 26 per 1,000 students ages 15–18.
Differences in the rates of total victimization of
students ages 12–18 at school by urbanicity were
observed in 2014 (table 2.2, figure 2.3). In 2014,
students residing in rural areas had higher rates of
total victimization at school (53 victimizations per
1,000 students) than students residing in suburban
areas (28 victimizations per 1,000 students). These
differences were primarily driven by higher rates
of violent victimization at school among students
living in rural areas. In the same year, the rate of
total victimization at school for students residing
in urban areas was 32 victimizations per 1,000
students; the rates between rural and urban areas
were not measurably different. Violent victimization
rates at school were 40 per 1,000 students in rural
areas, compared with 16 per 1,000 students in urban
areas and 14 per 1,000 students in suburban areas.
There were no measurable differences in rates of
theft at school by urbanicity. In 2014, there were
no differences by urbanicity in total victimization
rates, theft rates, or violent victimization rates for
victimizations that occurred away from school.

Indicator 3
Prevalence of Victimization at School
In 2013, approximately 3 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being victimized at school during the
previous 6 months. Two percent of students reported theft, 1 percent reported violent victimization, and less
than one-half of 1 percent reported serious violent victimization. Between 1995 and 2013, the percentage
of students ages 12–18 who reported being victimized at school decreased overall, as did the percentages of
students who reported theft, violent victimization, and serious violent victimization.
The School Crime Supplement (SCS)22 to the
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) makes
possible the comparison, across student demographic
characteristics (e.g., grade, sex, and race/ethnicity),
of victimization rate data collected from the NCVS.
The SCS is administered only to students who have
already completed the NCVS; thus, the calculation
of estimates presented here is based on a subset of
the student sample used to calculate the estimates
presented in Indicator 2. Results from the most recent
data collection show that in 2013 approximately
3 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being
victimized at school23 during the previous 6 months.
Two percent of students reported theft,24 1 percent
reported violent victimization,25 and less than one half
of 1 percent reported serious violent victimization26
(figure 3.1 and table 3.1).
In 2013, a higher percentage of 9th-graders than of
12th-graders reported being victimized at school during
the previous 6 months (4 vs. 2 percent; figure  3.2 and

table 3.1). The percentage of students who reported
theft was higher for 9th- and 10th-graders (3 percent
each) and 11th-graders (2 percent) than for 8thgraders (1 percent). In addition, the percentage of
students who reported violent victimization was
higher for 6th-graders (3 percent) than for 10thand 11th-graders (1 percent each). No measurable
differences were observed by sex or race/ethnicity in
reports of victimization overall or in reports of specific
types of victimization.
Among students ages 12–18 in 2013, the percentage
reporting theft at school during the previous 6 months
was higher for students from urban and suburban
areas (2 percent each) than for students from rural
areas (1 percent). No measurable differences were
observed between public and private schools in
student reports of victimization overall or in reports
of specific types of victimization.
Indicator 3 continued on page 32.

Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on
similar topics, Indicator 2 is based solely on data collected in
the NCVS, whereas Indicator 3 is based on data collected in
the School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the NCVS as well as
demographic data collected in the NCVS. Indicator 2 uses data
from all students ages 12–18 who responded to the NCVS,
while Indicator 3 uses data from all students ages 12–18 who
responded to both the NCVS and the SCS.
23
“At school” includes the school building, on school property,
on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from
school.
24
“Theft” includes attempted and completed purse-snatching,
completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed
thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not
include robbery, which involves the threat or use of force and is
classified as a violent crime.
25
“Violent victimization” includes serious violent crimes and
simple assault.
26
“Serious violent victimization” includes rape, sexual assault,
robbery, and aggravated assault.

Serious violent victimization is also included in violent victimization.
NOTE: “Total victimization” includes theft and violent victimization. “Theft” includes attempted and completed purse-snatching, completed
pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery, which involves
the threat or use of force and is classified as a violent crime. “Serious violent victimization” includes the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, and
aggravated assault. “Violent victimization” includes the serious violent crimes as well as simple assault. “At school” includes the school building,
on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and
because students who reported both theft and violent victimization are counted only once in total victimization. Although Indicators 2 and 3 present
information on similar topics, Indicator 2 is based solely on data collected in the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), whereas Indicator 3 is
based on data collected in the School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the NCVS as well as demographic data collected in the NCVS. Indicator 2 uses
data from all students ages 12–18 who responded to the NCVS, while Indicator 3 uses data from all students ages 12–18 who responded to both
the NCVS and the SCS.

Between 1995 and 2013, the percentage of students
ages 12–18 who reported being victimized at school
during the previous 6 months decreased overall (from
10 to 3 percent), as did the percentages of students
who reported theft (from 7 to 2 percent), violent
victimization (from 3 to 1 percent), and serious violent
victimization (from 1 percent to less than one-half of
1 percent). The percentage of students who reported
being victimized at school decreased between 1995
and 2013 for both male (from 10 to 3  percent)
and female students (from 9 to 3 percent), as well
as for White (from 10 to 3 percent), Black (from
10  to 3 percent), and Hispanic students (from 8 to
3 percent). In addition, the percentages of students
who reported being victimized decreased between
1995 and 2013 for all grades 6 through 12.

32

Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization

A decrease between 1995 and 2013 in the percentage
of students reporting criminal victimization also
occurred by school characteristics. About 9 percent
of students from urban areas, 10 percent of students
from suburban areas, and 8 percent of students
from rural areas reported being victimized at school
in 1995, compared with 3 percent each of students
from urban and suburban areas and 2 percent of
students from rural areas in 2013. About 10 percent
of public school students and 7 percent of private
school students reported being victimized at school
in 1995; the reported percent decreased to 3 percent
each for public and private school students in 2013.

Indicator 4
Threats and Injuries With Weapons on School Property
In 2013, about 7 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported that they were threatened or injured with
a weapon on school property. The percentage of students who reported being threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property has decreased over the last decade, from 9 percent in 2003 to 7 percent in 2013.
In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades
9–12 were asked whether they had been threatened or
injured with a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club on
school property27 during the 12 months preceding the
survey. In 2013, about 7 percent of students reported
they were threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property (table 4.1). This percentage was not
measurably different from the percentages reported
in 2011 and in 1993 (the first year of data collection
for this item), but it decreased over the last decade,
from a high of 9 percent in 2003 to 7 percent in 2013.
In each survey year from 1993 to 2013, a higher
percentage of males than of females reported being
threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property in the previous 12 months (figure 4.1 and
table 4.1). In 2013, approximately 8 percent of males
and 6 percent of females reported being threatened
or injured with a weapon on school property. The
percentage of males who reported being threatened or
injured with a weapon on school property was lower
in 2013 than in 2011 (8 vs. 10 percent); however, the
percentages for females were not measurably different
between these two years.
There were differences in the percentages of students
who reported being threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property in the previous 12 months
by race/ethnicity and grade level. In 2013, lower
percentages of White students (6 percent) and Asian
students (5 percent) than of Hispanic students
(8  percent) and American Indian/Alaska Native
students (18 percent) reported being threatened or

27

injured with a weapon on school property (figure 4.2
and table 4.1). In addition, a lower percentage of
White students than of Black students reported
being threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property (6 vs. 8 percent). In 2013, a lower percentage
of 12th-graders (5 percent) than of students in any
other grade (9 percent of 9th-graders and 7 percent
each of 10th- and 11th-graders) reported being
threatened or injured with a weapon (table 4.1).
As part of the survey students were also asked how
many times they had been threatened or injured with
a weapon on school property during the previous
12 months. In 2013, 93 percent of students reported
that they had not been threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property. A higher percentage of
students reported being threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property 1 time (3 percent) than
reported being threatened or injured with a weapon
on school property 2 or 3 times (2 percent), 4 to 11
times (1  percent), or 12 or more times (1 percent;
figure 4.3 and table 4.1).
In 2013, the percentage of public school students who
reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property during the previous 12 months varied
among the 35 states for which data were available.
Among these states, the percentage of students who
reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property ranged from 4 percent in Wisconsin
and Massachusetts to 11 percent in Louisiana and
Arkansas (table 4.2).

“On school property” was not defined for survey respondents.

Indicator 5
Teachers Threatened With Injury or Physically Attacked by Students
During the 2011–12 school year, a higher percentage of public than private school teachers reported being
threatened with injury (10 vs. 3 percent) or being physically attacked (6 vs. 3 percent) by a student from
their school.
Students are not the only victims of intimidation or
violence in schools. Teachers are also subject to threats
and physical attacks, and students from their schools
sometimes commit these offenses. The Schools and
Staffing Survey (SASS) asks school teachers whether
they were threatened with injury or physically
attacked by a student from their school in the previous
12 months. During the 2011–12 school year, 9 percent
of school teachers reported being threatened with
injury by a student from their school (table 5.1).
This percentage was lower than the 12 percent of
teachers who reported being threatened with injury in
1993–94, but higher than the percentages of teachers
who reported being threatened with injury in
2003–04 and 2007–08 (7 percent each; figure 5.1).
The percentage of teachers reporting that they had
been physically attacked by a student from their school
in 2011–12 (5 percent) was higher than in any previous
survey year (ranging from 3 to 4 percent).
During the 2011–12 school year, there were no
measurable differences in the percentages of male
and female teachers who reported being threatened
with injury during the school year (9 percent each);
however, there were gender differences in the reports
of being physically attacked (figure 5.2). Six percent
of female school teachers reported being physically
attacked by a student from their school, compared
with 4 percent of male teachers.
There were some differences in the percentages of
teachers who reported being threatened by a student
and being physically attacked by the race/ethnicity

of the teacher. In the 2011–12 school year, a higher
percentage of Black teachers (14 percent) than White
teachers and teachers of other racial/ethnic groups
(9 percent each) reported being threatened by a
student from their school during the school year.
A higher percentage of Black teachers (8 percent)
than Hispanic teachers (4 percent) reported being
physically attacked by a student.
The percentages of teachers who reported being
threatened with injury or being physically attacked
during the school year by a student from their school
varied by school characteristics during the 2011–12
school year (figure 5.3). The percentage of elementary
teachers who reported being physically attacked by a
student was higher than the percentage of secondary
teachers reporting it (8 vs. 3 percent). In addition,
a higher percentage of public than private school
teachers reported being threatened with injury
(10 vs. 3 percent) or being physically attacked (6 vs.
3 percent) by a student during 2011–12.
Public school teachers’ reports of being threatened
with injury or physically attacked varied among
the states and the District of Columbia. During the
2011–12 school year, the percentage of public school
teachers who reported being threatened with injury
during the previous 12 months ranged from 5 percent
in Oregon to 18 percent in Louisiana (table 5.2). The
percentage who reported being physically attacked
ranged from 3 percent in Alabama, Mississippi,
North Dakota, Oregon, and Tennessee to 11 percent
in Wisconsin.

Indicator 6
Violent and Other Criminal Incidents at Public Schools, and Those
Reported to the Police
During the 2013–14 school year, 65 percent of public schools recorded that one or more violent incidents
had taken place, amounting to an estimated 757,000 crimes. This figure translates to a rate of approximately
15 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled in 2013–14.
In 2013–14, public school principals were asked to
provide the number of incidents of violent crime28 and
serious violent crime29 that occurred at their school30
on the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) survey of
school safety and discipline. This indicator presents
the percentage of public schools that recorded one or
more of these specified incidents, the total number of
these incidents recorded, and the rate of incidents of
crime per 1,000 students.31 In the School Survey on
Crime and Safety (SSOCS) administered in earlier
years, public school principals were asked to provide
the number of incidents of violent crime, incidents
of serious violent crime, thefts of items valued at
$10 or greater without personal confrontation, and
other incidents32 that occurred at their school. In this
survey, public school principals were also asked to
provide the number of incidents they reported to the
police. Data on these additional items are presented
for the 2009–10 school year.
During the 2013–14 school year, 65 percent of public
schools recorded that one or more violent incidents
had taken place, amounting to an estimated 757,000
incidents (figure 6.1 and table 6.1). This figure
translates to a rate of approximately 15 crimes per
1,000 students enrolled in 2013–14.

Violent incidents can be examined by the specific
types of incidents that schools recorded. In 2013–14,
about 58 percent of public schools reported one or
more incidents of a physical attack or fight without a
weapon. This percentage translates to approximately
453,000 incidents at a rate of about 9 crimes per 1,000
students. Some 47 percent of schools reported one or
more incidents of threat of physical attack without a
weapon (a rate of 6 crimes per 1,000 students).
Serious violent incidents are included within the
total number of violent incidents, but can also be
examined on their own. About 13 percent of public
schools recorded one or more serious violent incidents
in 2013–14 (a rate of 1 crime per 1,000 students). The
types of serious violent incidents recorded included:
threat of physical attack with a weapon (9 percent),
robbery without a weapon (2 percent), physical attack
or fight with a weapon (2 percent), sexual battery
other than rape (2 percent), and rape or attempted
rape (less than one half of 1 percent). Each type of
serious violent incident translates to a rate of less than
1 crime per 1,000 students.
Indicator 6 continued on page 44.

28
“Violent incidents” include rape, sexual battery other than
rape, physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, threat
of physical attack with or without a weapon, and robbery with
or without a weapon.
29
“Serious violent incidents” include rape, sexual battery other
than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon, threat of
physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a
weapon.
30
“At school” was defined for respondents to include activities
that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school
buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or
activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that
occurred before, during, or after normal school hours, or when
school activities or events were in session.
31
Hereafter referred to as the rate of crime per 1,000 students.
32
“Other incidents” include possession of a firearm or explosive
device; possession of a knife or sharp object; distribution,

The percentage of public schools that recorded violent
incidents and serious violent incidents varied by
school characteristics. For example, primary schools
recorded lower percentages of violent incidents
(53  percent) than middle schools (88 percent) and
high schools and combined elementary/secondary
schools (referred to as high/combined schools)
(78  percent; figure 6.2 and table 6.2). Similarly, a
lower percentage of primary schools recorded serious
violent incidents (9 percent) than middle or high/
combined schools (18 and 19 percent, respectively).
In 2013–14, about 86 percent of public schools with
1,000 or more students enrolled recorded violent
incidents at school, higher than the percentages
reported by schools with fewer students enrolled.
The same pattern by enrollment size was observed
for the percentage of schools recording serious violent
incidents. A higher percentage of schools located
in towns recorded violent incidents (76 percent)
than those located in rural areas (62 percent) and
suburban areas (60 percent), and a higher percentage
of schools located in towns recorded serious violent
incidents (17 percent) than those located in rural areas
(10  percent). Additionally, a higher percentage of
schools located in cities (18 percent) recorded serious
violent incidents than those located in suburban areas
(11 percent) and rural areas.
In 2013–14, a lower percentage of schools where
0 to 25 percent of students were eligible for free
or reduced-price lunch recorded violent incidents
(51  percent) than those schools where a larger
percentage of students were eligible for free or

44

School Environment

reduced-price lunch. The percentage of schools that
recorded serious violent incidents was also lower for
schools where 0 to 25 percent of students were eligible
for free or reduced-price lunch (10 percent) than for
schools where 76 to 100 percent of students were
eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (16 percent).
In the SSOCS, public school principals were asked to
provide the number of thefts of items valued at $10
or greater without personal confrontation, and other
incidents that occurred at their school in addition to
reporting the number of violent incidents and serious
violent incidents. During the 2009–10 school year,
85 percent of public schools recorded that one or more
of these types of incidents had taken place (table 6.1).
During the same year, 60 percent of schools reported
one of the specified incidents to the police.
In 2009–10, a greater percentage of public schools
recorded a criminal incident than reported a criminal
incident to the police. This pattern held true for
violent incidents, serious violent incidents, thefts, and
other criminal incidents (tables 6.1 and 6.3). Seventyfour percent of schools recorded one or more violent
incidents, 16 percent recorded one or more serious
violent incidents, 44 percent recorded one or more
thefts, and 68 percent recorded one or more other
criminal incidents. In comparison, 40 percent of
public schools reported at least one violent incident to
police, 10 percent reported at least one serious violent
incident to police, 25 percent reported at least one
theft to police, and 46 percent reported one or more
other criminal incidents to police.

Indicator 7
Discipline Problems Reported by Public Schools
The percentage of public schools that reported student bullying occurred at least once a week decreased from
29 percent in 1999–2000 to 16 percent in 2013–14.
Between 1999–2000 and 2009–10, the School Survey
on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) asked public school
principals how often certain disciplinary problems
happened in their schools33 during the school years
in which this survey was administered. More recently,
in 2013–14, school principals were asked to provide
responses to a similar set of questions on the Fast
Response Survey System (FRSS) survey of school
safety and discipline. This indicator examines whether
the following discipline problems were reported by
public schools at least once a week: student racial/
ethnic tensions, student bullying, student sexual
harassment of other students, student harassment of
other students based on sexual orientation or gender
identity, student verbal abuse of teachers, student acts
of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse,
and widespread disorder in the classroom. In the
2009–10 SSOCS survey administration, schools were
also asked to report selected types of cyber-bullying34
problems at school or away from school that occurred
at least once a week.
In 2013–14, about 16 percent of public schools
reported that bullying occurred among students at
least once a week (figure 7.1 and table 7.1). About
5 percent of public schools reported verbal abuse
of teachers, 9 percent reported acts of disrespect
for teachers other than verbal abuse, and 2 percent
reported widespread disorder in the classroom. About
1 percent of public schools reported each of the
following occurred at least once a week in 2013–14:
Student racial/ethnic tensions, sexual harassment
of other students, and harassment of other students
based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

The percentage of public schools that reported student
bullying occurred at least once a week decreased from
29 percent in 1999–2000 to 16 percent in 2013–14
(figure 7.1 and table 7.1). Similarly, the percentage of
schools that reported the occurrence of student verbal
abuse of teachers at least once a week decreased from
13 percent in 1999–2000 to 5 percent in 2013–14.
The percentages of public schools that reported the
occurrence of student racial/ethnic tensions was
lower in 2013–14 than in most prior survey years.
For example, 3 percent of schools reported student
racial/ethnic tensions in 1999–2000, compared to
1 percent of schools in 2013–14.
The percentage of public schools reporting student
sexual harassment of other students at least once
a week was lower in 2013–14 (1 percent) than in
every prior survey year since data collection began in
2003–04 (table 7.1). The percentage of public schools
reporting student harassment of other students based
on sexual orientation or gender identity was lower in
2013–14 (1 percent) than in 2009–10 (3 percent), the
first year data on this item were collected.
There was no measurable difference in the percentage
of schools that reported widespread disorder in the
classroom in 1999–2000 and 2013–14 (figure 7.1
and table 7.1). Similarly, there was no measurable
difference in the percentage of schools reporting
student acts of disrespect for teachers other than
verbal abuse in 2007–08 (the first year of data
collection for this item) and 2013–14.
Indicator 7 continued on page 48.

33
“At school” was defined for respondents to include activities
that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school
buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or
activities. Respondents were instructed to respond only for those
times that were during normal school hours or when school
activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified
otherwise.
34
“Cyber-bullying” was defined for respondents as “occurring
when willful and repeated harm is inflicted through the use of
computers, cell phones, or other electronic devices.”

NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At school” was
defined to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events
or activities. Respondents were instructed to respond only for those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events
were in session, unless the survey specified otherwise. Data for 2013–14 were collected using the Fast Response Survey System, while data for
earlier years were collected using the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS). The 2013–14 survey was designed to allow comparisons with
SSOCS data. However, respondents to the 2013–14 survey could choose either to complete the survey on paper (and mail it back) or to complete
the survey online, whereas respondents to SSOCS did not have the option of completing the survey online. The 2013–14 survey also relied on a
smaller sample. The smaller sample size and change in survey administration may have impacted 2013–14 results.

During the 2013–14 school year, the most commonly
reported discipline problem among public schools
was student bullying. The percentage of public
schools that reported student bullying occurred
at least once a week was higher for middle schools
(25 percent) than high schools and combined
elementary/secondary schools (referred to as high/
combined schools) (17 percent), and the percentages
for both of these school levels were higher than
the percentage for primary schools (12 percent;
figure 7.2 and table 7.1). A higher percentage of
schools with enrollments of 1,000 or more reported
student bullying (22 percent) than schools of any
other enrollment size. A higher percentage of schools
located in towns (24 percent) reported bullying as
compared to schools located in suburbs (13 percent),
cities (15 percent), and rural areas (15 percent). A lower
percentage of schools where 25 percent or less of the
students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch
reported student bullying (8 percent) than schools
with any other percentage of students eligible for free
or reduced-price lunch.35
In 2009–10, the SSOCS included a questionnaire
item on cyber-bullying in which public schools were
asked to report the occurrence of cyber-bullying

35 
The percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price
lunch programs is a proxy measure of school poverty.

among students at school and away from school.
Eight percent of public schools reported that cyberbullying had occurred among students daily or at
least once a week at school or away from school.
Four percent of public schools also reported that the
school environment was affected by cyber-bullying.
Similarly, 4 percent of schools reported that staff
resources were used to deal with cyber-bullying
(figure 7.3 and table 7.2).
Public schools’ reports on the occurrence of cyberbullying at school and away from school in 2009–10
varied by school characteristics (table 7.2). Primary
schools reported lower percentages of cyber-bullying
among students (2 percent) than middle schools
(19 percent), high schools (18 percent), and combined
schools (13 percent). Thirteen percent of schools with
less than 5 percent combined enrollment of minority
students (defined as Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific
Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native students)
reported cyber-bullying among students, compared
with 5 percent of schools with 50 percent or more
combined enrollment of these racial/ethnic groups.

Indicator 8
Students’ Reports of Gangs at School
The percentage of students ages 12–18 who reported that gangs were present at their school decreased from
18 percent in 2011 to 12 percent in 2013. A higher percentage of students from urban areas (18 percent)
reported a gang presence than students from suburban (11 percent) and rural areas (7 percent) in 2013.
In order to assess gang activity in and around the
vicinity of schools, the School Crime Supplement
to the National Crime Victimization Survey asked
students ages 12–18 if gangs were present at their
school36 during the school year. The percentage of
students ages 12–18 who reported that gangs were
present at their school decreased from 18 percent in
2011 to 12 percent in 2013 (figure 8.1 and table 8.1).
The percentage of students who reported a gang
presence has decreased every year since 2005, when
it was 24 percent.
In 2013, a higher percentage of students from urban
areas (18 percent) reported a gang presence at their
school than students from suburban (11 percent) and
rural areas (7 percent). Between 2011 and 2013, the
percentages of students from urban and suburban
areas who reported a gang presence at their school
both decreased (from 23 to 18 percent for students
from urban areas and from 16 to 11 percent for
students in suburban areas). There was no measurable
change in the percentage of rural students who
reported a gang presence at their school between
2011 and 2013.
A higher percentage of students attending public
schools (13 percent) than of students attending private
schools (2 percent) reported that gangs were present at
their school in 2013. The percentage of public school
students who reported a gang presence decreased from
19 percent in 2011 to 13 percent in 2013. However,
the percentage of private school students who reported
a gang presence at their school in 2013 was not
measurably different from the percentage in 2011.

In 2013, the percentages of male and female students
who reported a gang presence at their school were not
measurably different (13 and 12 percent, respectively).
Between 2011 and 2013, the percentage of male
students who reported a gang presence decreased
from 18 to 13 percent, and the percentage of female
students who reported a gang presence decreased from
17 to 12 percent.
Higher percentages of Hispanic (20 percent) and
Black (19 percent) students reported the presence
of gangs at their school than White (7 percent) and
Asian (9 percent) students (figure 8.2 and table 8.1).
The percentage of White students who reported a
gang presence decreased from 11 percent in 2011 to
7 percent in 2013. Similarly, between 2011 and 2013
the percentage of Black students who reported a gang
presence decreased from 33 to 19 percent, and the
percentage of Hispanic students decreased from 26
to 20 percent. The percentages reported in 2013 by
Asian students and students of other races/ethnicities
were not measurably different from the percentages
reported in 2011.
The percentages of students in 6th through 8th
grade who reported a gang presence at their school
were lower than the percentages for students in 9th
through 12th grade in 2013 (table 8.1). Five percent
of 6th-graders and 8 percent each of 7th- and 8thgraders reported the presence of gangs, compared
with 14 percent of 9th-graders, 15 percent of 12thgraders, 17 percent of 11th-graders, and 18 percent
of 10th-graders.

36
“At school” includes in the school building, on school
property, on a school bus, and going to and from school.

Indicator 9
Illegal Drug Availability and Drug-Related Discipline Incidents
The percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported that illegal drugs were offered, sold, or given to them
on school property increased from 1993 to 1995 (from 24 to 32 percent), but then decreased to 22 percent
in 2013. The percentage of students who reported that illegal drugs were made available to them on school
property was lower in 2013 than in 2011 (22 vs. 26 percent).
This indicator uses data from the Youth Risk Behavior
Survey (YRBS) to discuss whether students had
been offered, sold, or given an illegal drug on school
property, and then uses state data from the EDFacts
data collection to discuss the number of discipline
incidents resulting in the removal of a student for
at least an entire school day that involve students’
possession or use of tobacco or illicit drugs on school
grounds. Readers should take note of the differing
data sources and terminology.
In the YRBS, students in grades 9–12 were asked
whether someone had offered, sold, or given them
an illegal drug on school property in the 12 months
preceding the survey.37 From 1993 to 1995, the
percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported
that illegal drugs were made available to them on
school property increased (from 24 to 32 percent),
but then decreased to 22 percent in 2013 (table 9.1).
There was no measurable difference between the
percentages reported in 1993 and 2013. However,
the percentage of students who reported that drugs
were made available to them on school property was
lower in 2013 (22 percent) than in 2011 (26 percent;
figure 9.1 and table 9.1).
In every survey year from 1993 to 2013, a lower
percentage of females than of males reported that
illegal drugs were offered, sold, or given to them on
school property. In 2013, some 20 percent of females
and 24 percent of males reported that illegal drugs
were made available to them on school property. The
percentage of males who reported that drugs were
offered, sold, or given to them on school property in
2013 was lower than the percentage reported in 2011
(29 percent). However, for females the percentage
reported in 2013 was not measurably different from
the percentage reported in 2011.
37

In 2013, lower percentages of Black students
(19 percent) and White students (20 percent) than of
Hispanic students (27 percent) and students of Two
or more races (26 percent) reported that illegal drugs
were offered, sold, or given to them on school property
(figure 9.2 and table 9.1). In addition, the percentage
of Black students who reported that illegal drugs were
made available to them on school property was lower
than the percentage of Pacific Islander students (19 vs.
28 percent). Between 2011 and 2013, the percentages
of Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska
Native students who reported that illegal drugs were
made available to them on school property declined.
A lower percentage of 12th-graders than of 9th-,
10th-, or 11th-graders reported that illegal drugs
were made available to them on school property in
2013 (table 9.1). Nineteen percent of 12th-graders
reported that illegal drugs were made available to
them on school property that year, compared with
22 percent of 9th-graders and 23 percent each of
10th- and 11th-graders.
In 2013, public school students’ reports of the
availability of illegal drugs on school property varied
across the 36 states for which data were available
(table  9.2). Among these states, the percentage of
students reporting that illegal drugs were offered,
sold, or given to them on school property ranged
from 12 percent in Mississippi to 33 percent in
New Mexico.

It is also important to examine discipline incidents
that result from illicit drug-related activities at school,
which reflect disruptions in the educational process
and provide a gauge for the scope of drug use at
school. As part of the EDFacts data collection, state
education agencies report the number of discipline
incidents resulting in the removal of a student for
at least an entire school day that involve students’
possession or use of illicit drugs on school grounds.38
State education agencies compile these data based
on incidents that were reported by their schools
and school districts. During the 2013–14 school
year, there were 197,000 reported illicit drug-related
discipline incidents in the United States (table  9.3).39
The number of illicit drug-related incidents varies
widely across states, due in large part to states’

differing populations. Therefore, the rate of illicit
drug-related discipline incidents per 100,000 students
can provide a more comparable indication of the
frequency of these incidents across states. During the
2013–14 school year, the rate of illicit drug-related
discipline incidents was 394 per 100,000 students in
the United States.
The majority of states had rates between 100 and
1,000 illicit drug-related discipline incidents per
100,000 students during the 2013–14 school year.
Five states had rates of illicit drug-related discipline
incidents per 100,000 students that were below 100:
Wyoming, Texas, Tennessee, Virginia, and Michigan,
while two states had rates above 1,000: Kentucky and
New Mexico.

Indicator 10
Students’ Reports of Being Called Hate-Related Words and Seeing
Hate-Related Graffiti
In 2013, about 7 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being the target of hate-related words and
25 percent reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the school year; the corresponding 2011
percentages were both higher (9 and 28 percent, respectively).
The School Crime Supplement to the National Crime
Victimization Survey collects data on students’
reports of being the target of hate-related40 words and
seeing hate-related graffiti at school.41 Specifically,
students ages 12–18 were asked whether someone
at school had called them a derogatory word having
to do with their race, ethnicity, religion, disability,
gender, or sexual orientation. Additionally, students
were asked if they had seen hate-related graffiti at
their school—that is, hate-related words or symbols
written in classrooms, bathrooms, or hallways or on
the outside of the school building.
In 2013, about 7 percent of students ages 12–18
reported being the target of hate-related words at
school during the school year, which was lower
than the 9 percent reported in 2011 (figure 10.1 and
table 10.1). The percentage of students who reported
being the target of hate-related words decreased from
12 percent in 2001 (the first year of data collection
for this item) to 7 percent in 2013. Similarly, in
2013, about 25 percent of students reported seeing
hate-related graffiti at school during the school year,
which was lower than the 28 percent reported in
2011, and also represented a decrease from the 36
percent reported in 1999, when data for students’
reports of seeing hate-related graffiti at school were
first collected.
The percentages of males and females who reported
being called a hate-related word during the school
year did not measurably differ in any survey year from
2001 to 2013. The percentages of male and female
students who reported being called a hate-related
word were lower in 2013 (7 percent each) than in

2011 (9 percent each). In addition, the percentages
of both males and females who reported being called
a hate-related word decreased overall between 2001
and 2013 (from 13 to 7 percent for males and from
12 to 7 percent for females).
The percentages of males and females who reported
seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the school
year did not measurably differ in any survey year
from 2001 to 2013. The percentage of male students
who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school was
lower in 2013 (24 percent) than in 2011 (29 percent),
as well as in 1999 (34 percent). The percentage of
female students who reported seeing hate-related
graffiti at school was lower in 2013 (25  percent)
than in 2011 (28 percent) and lower than in 1999
(39 percent).
In 2013, a lower percentage of White students than
students of any other race/ethnicity reported being
called a hate-related word during the school year.
About 5 percent of White students reported being
called a hate-related word, compared with 7 percent
of Hispanic students, 8 percent of Black students,
10 percent of Asian students, and 11 percent of
students of other races/ethnicities. There were no
measurable differences by race/ethnicity, however, in
the percentages of students who reported seeing haterelated graffiti at school in 2013. About 21 percent
of Asian students, 24 percent of White students,
26  percent each of Hispanic and Black students,
and 28 percent of students of other races/ethnicities
reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school.

Some measurable differences were observed across
grades in students’ reports of being called a haterelated word and seeing hate-related graffiti at
school in 2013 (figure 10.1 and table 10.1). In 2013,
a lower percentage of 12th-graders (4 percent) than
of 7th-, 8th-, and 9th-graders (7 percent each), and
11th-graders (8  percent) reported being called a
hate-related word at school. A lower percentage of
7th-graders (22 percent) reported seeing hate-rated
graffiti at school than 9th- and 10th-graders (27 and
26 percent, respectively).
In each data collection year between 1999 and 2013,
a higher percentage of public school students than of
private school students reported seeing hate-related
graffiti at school. For instance, in 2013, approximately
26 percent of public school students reported
seeing hate-related graffiti at school, compared with
13 percent of private school students. However, the
percentages of public and private school students
who reported being called a hate-related word were
not measurably different in 2013 (7 percent each).

School Environment

Students who reported being the target of haterelated words at school in 2013 were asked to indicate
whether the derogatory word they were called referred
to their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, or
sexual orientation (figure 10.2 and table 10.2). A lower
percentage of male students than of female students
reported being called a hate-related word referring
to their gender (less than one-half of 1 percent vs.
2 percent).
With respect to being called a hate-related word
referring to their race, a lower percentage of White
students than of their peers reported being targeted
in 2013 (table 10.2). Specifically, 2 percent of White
students reported being called a hate-related word
referring to their race, compared with 4 percent of
Hispanic students, 6 percent of Black students, and 8
percent each of Asian students and students of other
races/ethnicities.

Students who indicated that they had been called a hate-related word were asked to choose the specific characteristics that the hate-related word
or words targeted. Students were allowed to choose more than one characteristic. If a student chose more than one characteristic, he or she is
counted only once in the total percentage of students who reported being called a hate-related word; therefore, the total is less than the sum of the
students’ individual characteristics.

Indicator 11
Bullying at School and Cyber-Bullying Anywhere
The percentage of students who reported being bullied was lower in 2013 (22 percent) than in every prior
survey year (28 percent each in 2005, 2009, and 2011 and 32 percent in 2007).
The School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the National
Crime Victimization Survey collects data on bullying42
and cyber-bullying43 by asking students ages 12–18 if
they had been bullied at school44 and cyber-bullied
anywhere during the school year. Students were also
asked about the types and frequencies of bullying
and cyber-bullying they had been subjected to, as
well as whether an adult at school45 had been notified
of the incidents. Cyber-bullying is distinct from
bullying at school; however, bullying at school might
be a pertinent context to understand cyber-bullying
anywhere. In the SCS, survey items on cyber-bullying
anywhere were asked separately from survey items
on bullying at school. In a different survey, the
Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), students in
grades 9–12 were asked if they had been bullied on
school property46 or electronically bullied during the
previous 12 months. In addition to collecting data at
the national level, the YRBS also collects data at the
state level. Readers should take note of the differing
data sources and terminology.
On the SCS in 2013, about 22 percent of students
ages 12–18 reported being bullied at school during the
school year (figure 11.1 and table 11.1). Of students
42

“Bullying” includes students who responded that another
student had made fun of them, called them names, or insulted
them; spread rumors about them; threatened them with harm;
tried to make them do something they did not want to do;
excluded them from activities on purpose; destroyed their
property on purpose; or pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on
them.
43
“Cyber-bullying” includes students who responded that
another student had posted hurtful information about them on
the Internet; purposely shared private information about them
on the Internet; threatened or insulted them through instant
messaging; threatened or insulted them through text messaging;
threatened or insulted them through e-mail; threatened or
insulted them while gaming; or excluded them online.
44
“At school” includes the school building, on school property,
on a school bus, or going to and from school.
45
“Adult at school” refers to a teacher or other adult at school.
46
In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), bullying was
defined for respondents as “when one or more students tease,
threaten, spread rumors about, hit, shove, or hurt another
student over and over again.” “On school property” was not
defined for survey respondents.

ages 12–18, about 14 percent reported that they were
made fun of, called names, or insulted; 13 percent
reported being the subject of rumors; and 6 percent
reported that they were pushed, shoved, tripped,
or spit on. Of those students who reported being
pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on at school, about
21 percent reported injury as a result of the incident.
Additionally, about 4 percent of all students reported
being excluded from activities on purpose, 4 percent
reported being threatened with harm, 2 percent
reported that others tried to make them do things
they did not want to do, and 2 percent reported that
their property was destroyed by others on purpose.
In 2013, a higher percentage of females than of males
ages 12–18 reported being bullied at school during
the school year (24 vs. 19 percent). Also, higher
percentages of females than of males reported that
they were made fun of, called names, or insulted
(15 vs. 13 percent); were the subject of rumors (17 vs.
10 percent); and were excluded from activities on
purpose (5 vs. 4 percent). In contrast, a higher
percentage of males (7 percent) than of females
(5 percent) reported being pushed, shoved, tripped,
or spit on.
A higher percentage of White students (24 percent)
than of Hispanic students (19 percent) and Asian
students (9 percent) reported being bullied at school
in 2013. In addition, higher percentages of Black
students (20 percent) and Hispanic students than
of Asian students reported being bullied at school.
A higher percentage of White students (16 percent)
than of Hispanic students (12 percent), Black
students (10 percent), and Asian students (7 percent)
reported being made fun of, called names, or insulted.
Similarly, 15 percent of White students reported that
they had been the subject of rumors, compared with
11 percent of Hispanic students and 4 percent of
Asian students.

Higher percentages of students in grades 6 through
11 than of students in grade 12 reported being
bullied at school during the school year. In 2013,
about 14   percent of 12th-graders reported being
bullied at school, compared with 28 percent of 6thgraders, 26 percent of 7th-graders, 22 percent of
8th-graders, 23 percent of 9th-graders, 19 percent
of 10th-graders, and 20 percent of 11th-graders.
No measurable differences were observed in the
percentage of students who reported being bullied
at school by school characteristics such as urbanicity
and control of school.

In 2013, approximately 7 percent of students ages
12–18 reported being cyber-bullied anywhere during
the school year (figure 11.3 and table 11.3). About
3 percent of students reported that another student
had posted hurtful information about them on the
Internet, and 3 percent reported being the subject
of harassing text messages. Some 2 percent reported
being the subject of harassing instant messages
and 1 percent each reported having their private
information purposely shared on the Internet, being
the subject of harassing e-mails, being harassed while
gaming, and being excluded online.

The SCS also asked students ages 12–18 who
reported being bullied at school to indicate the
location where they had been victimized. In 2013,
of students who reported being bullied during the
school year, about 46 percent of students reported
that the bullying occurred in the hallway or stairwell
at school, 34  percent reported being bullied inside
the classroom, and 23 percent reported being bullied
outside on school grounds (figure 11.2 and table
11.2). About 19 percent of students who were bullied
reported that the bullying occurred in the cafeteria,
9 percent reported that it occurred in the bathroom
or locker room, 8 percent reported that it occurred on
the school bus, and 1 percent reported that it occurred
somewhere else in school.

A higher percentage of female students than of male
students ages 12–18 reported being victims of cyberbullying in 2013. Nine percent of females compared
with 5 percent of males were victims of cyber-bullying
overall. In particular, a higher percentage of females
than of males were victims of various types of cyberbullying: Having hurtful information about them
posted on the Internet by another student (5 vs.
1 percent), having their private information purposely
shared on the Internet (1 percent vs. less than one-half
of 1 percent), being the subject of harassing instant
messages (3 vs. 1 percent), and being the subject of
harassing text messages (5 vs. 2 percent). In contrast,
2 percent of male students reported being harassed
while gaming, compared with less than one-half of
1 percent of female students.

The percentage of students who reported being cyberbullied anywhere during the school year in 2013
was higher for White students (8 percent) than for
Black students (5 percent). There were no measurable
differences by grade level, urbanicity, or school sector
in the prevalence of students reporting being a victim
of cyber-bullying.
In 2013, about 33 percent of students who reported
being bullied at school indicated that they were
bullied at least once or twice a month during the
school year: 19 percent reported being bullied once
or twice a month, 8 percent reported being bullied
once or twice a week, and 6 percent reported being
bullied almost every day (figure 11.4 and table 11.4).
About 27  percent of students who reported being
cyber-bullied anywhere indicated that they were
cyber-bullied at least once or twice a month during
the school year: 15 percent reported being cyberbullied once or twice a month, 8 percent reported
being cyber-bullied once or twice a week, and
4 percent reported being cyber-bullied almost every
day. Among students who reported being cyberbullied, a higher percentage of females than of males
reported being cyber-bullied once or twice a month
(19 vs. 9 percent).

66

School Environment

Students who reported being bullied or cyber-bullied
were also asked whether they had notified an adult
about the incident. In 2013, a higher percentage
of students reported notifying an adult after being
bullied at school than after being cyber-bullied
anywhere (39 vs. 23 percent). While there was no
measurable difference by sex in the percentage of
students notifying an adult after being bullied at
school, a higher percentage of females than of males
reported notifying an adult after being cyber-bullied
(32 vs. 11 percent). In addition, higher percentages
of 6th- and 7th-graders than of 8th- through 12thgraders reported notifying an adult after being
bullied at school, and higher percentages of 7th- and
8th-graders than of 9th-graders reported notifying
an adult after being cyber-bullied. The percentage of
students who reported notifying an adult after being
bullied at school was higher for those who reported
being bullied once or twice a week (55 percent)
than for those who reported being bullied once or
twice a year (37 percent) or once or twice a month
(38 percent).

The percentages of students reporting being bullied
at school varied over time from 2005 through 2013.
Prior data are excluded from the time series due to
a significant redesign of the bullying items in 2005.
The percentage of students who reported being bullied
was lower in 2013 (22 percent) than in every prior
survey year (28 percent each in 2005, 2009, and
2011 and 32 percent in 2007; table 11.5). A similar
pattern was observed for some of the student and
school characteristics examined. For example, in 2013
about 24 percent of female students reported being
bullied at school, compared with 29 percent each in
2005 and 2009, about 31 percent in 2011, and 33
percent in 2007. Similarly, about 24 percent of White
students reported being bullied at school in 2013,
compared with 29 percent in 2009, about 30 percent
in 2005, about 31 percent in 2011, and 34 percent
in 2007. By school characteristics, in 2013 about 22
percent of students from suburban schools reported
being bullied at school, compared with 28 percent
in 2009, about 29 percent each in 2005 and 2011,
and 31 percent in 2007 (figure 11.5). Similarly, about

As mentioned in the introduction, the Youth Risk
Behavior Survey (YRBS) collects both national and
state-level data on bullying and electronic bullying for
students in grades 9–12. In 2013, both national and
state-level data on the percentages of students who
reported being bullied on school property during the
previous 12 months were available for 40 states (table
11.6). Among these states, the percentages of students
who reported being bullied on school property ranged
from 16 percent in Florida to 26 percent in Montana.
There were also 40 states that had 2013 data available
on the percentages of students who reported being
electronically bullied during the previous 12 months.
Among these states, the percentages of students
who reported being electronically bullied ranged
from 12 percent in Mississippi, Florida, and North
Carolina to 21 percent in Maine.

Indicator 12
Teachers’ Reports on School Conditions
In 2011–12, higher percentages of public school teachers than of private school teachers reported that student
misbehavior and student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching.
Managing inappropriate behaviors and classroom
disruptions is time-consuming and takes away from
valuable instructional time and student engagement in
academic behaviors (Riley et al. 2011). In the Schools
and Staffing Survey (SASS), public and private school
teachers were asked whether student misbehavior and
student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their
teaching. During the 2011–12 school year, 38 percent
of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that student
misbehavior interfered with their teaching, and
35 percent reported that student tardiness and class
cutting interfered with their teaching (figure 12.1
and table 12.1). Teachers were also asked whether
school rules were enforced by other teachers at their
school, even for students not in their classes, and
whether school rules were enforced by the principal.
In 2011–12, about 69 percent of teachers agreed or
strongly agreed that other teachers at their school
enforced the school rules, and 84 percent reported
that the principal enforced the school rules (figure
12.1 and table 12.2).
The percentages of teachers who reported that
student misbehavior and student tardiness and
class cutting interfered with their teaching varied
by school characteristics during the 2011–12 school
year (table 12.1). For example, a higher percentage
of public school teachers (41 percent) than of private
school teachers (22 percent) reported that student
misbehavior interfered with their teaching. Thirtyeight percent of public school teachers reported that
student tardiness and class cutting interfered with
their teaching, compared with 19 percent of private
school teachers.

In every survey year, a lower percentage of elementary
school teachers than of secondary school teachers
reported that student tardiness and class cutting
interfered with their teaching; in 2011–12,
31 percent of elementary school teachers and
45 percent of secondary school teachers reported that
student tardiness and class cutting interfered with
their teaching (table 12.1). There was no measurable
difference between the percentages of elementary and
secondary school teachers who reported that student
misbehavior interfered with their teaching.
The percentage of teachers who reported that student
misbehavior interfered with their teaching fluctuated
between 1993–94 and 2011–12; however, the
percentage was higher in 2011–12 (38 percent) than
in the previous survey year (34 percent in 2007–08;
figure 12.2). The percentage of teachers reporting
that student tardiness and class cutting interfered
with their teaching increased between 1993–94 and
2011–12 (from 25 to 35 percent). A higher percentage
of teachers reported that student tardiness and class
cutting interfered with their teaching in 2011–12
than in 2007–08 (35 vs. 31 percent).
In every survey year, a lower percentage of public
school teachers than of private school teachers agreed
that school rules were enforced by other teachers
and by the principal in their school (table 12.2). In
2011–12, some 68 percent of public school teachers
reported that school rules were enforced by other
teachers, compared with 77 percent of private school
teachers. In addition, 84 percent of public school
teachers reported that school rules were enforced by
the principal, compared with 89 percent of private
school teachers.

Between 1993–94 and 2011–12, the percentage of
teachers who agreed or strongly agreed that school
rules were enforced by other teachers fluctuated
between 64 and 73 percent, and the percentage who
agreed that rules were enforced by the principal
fluctuated between 82 and 89 percent, showing no
consistent trends. However, a lower percentage of
teachers reported that school rules were enforced
by other teachers in 2011–12 (69 percent) than in
the previous survey year (72 percent in 2007–08).
Similarly, the percentage of teachers who reported
that school rules were enforced by the principal
was lower in 2011–12 than in 2007–08 (84 vs.
89 percent).

School Environment

In 2011–12, the percentages of public school teachers
who reported that student misbehavior and student
tardiness and class cutting interfered with their
teaching varied by state. For example, among the 50
states and the District of Columbia, the percentage
of teachers who reported that student misbehavior
interfered with their teaching ranged from 31 percent
in Wyoming to 55 percent in Louisiana (table 12.3).
The percentages of teachers who reported that school
rules were enforced by other teachers and by the
principal also varied by state.

Physical Fights on School Property and Anywhere
The percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported being in a physical fight anywhere decreased between
1993 and 2013 (from 42 to 25 percent), and the percentage of students in these grades who reported being
in a physical fight on school property also decreased during this period (from 16 to 8 percent).
In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in
grades 9–12 were asked about their involvement in
physical fights in general (referred to as “anywhere”
in this indicator),47 as well as about their involvement
in physical fights on school property, during the
12 months preceding the survey.48 In this indicator,
percentages of students reporting involvement in
fights occurring anywhere are used as a point of
comparison with percentages of students reporting
involvement in fights occurring on school property.
Overall, the percentage of students in grades 9–12
who reported being in a physical fight anywhere
decreased between 1993 and 2013 (from 42 to
25 percent), and the percentage of students in these
grades who reported being in a physical fight on
school property also decreased during this period
(from 16 to 8 percent; figure 13.1 and table 13.1). The
percentage of students in these grades who reported
being in a physical fight anywhere was lower in 2013
(25 percent) than in 2011 (33 percent); the percentage
of those who reported being in a physical fight on
school property was also lower in 2013 (8 percent)
than in 2011 (12 percent).
From 1993 through 2013, the percentages of students
in grades 9–12 who reported being in a physical
fight anywhere as well as a physical fight on school
property decreased for all four grade levels. The 2013
percentages of 12th-graders who reported being in a
physical fight, either anywhere or on school property,
were lower than the percentages reported by 9th-,
10th-, and 11th-graders. In 2013, about 19 percent
of 12th-graders reported being in a physical fight
anywhere, compared with 28 percent of 9th-graders,
26 percent of 10th-graders, and 24 percent of
11th-graders. Similarly, 5 percent of 12th-graders,
compared with 11 percent of 9th-graders, 8 percent of
10th-graders, and 7 percent of 11th-graders reported
being in a physical fight on school property.
47

“Anywhere” includes on school property.
The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior
Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked
how many times in the past 12 months they had been in a
physical fight. In the question asking students about physical
fights at school, “on school property” was not defined for
survey respondents.
48

The percentages of 9th- to 12th-graders who reported
being in a physical fight in 2013 differed by race/
ethnicity. For example, a higher percentage of Black
students (35 percent) than of students of Two or more
races (29 percent), Hispanic students (28 percent),
Pacific Islander students (22 percent), White students
(21 percent), and Asian students (16 percent) reported
being in a physical fight anywhere (figure 13.2
and table 13.1). In addition, higher percentages of
Hispanic students and students of Two or more races
than of White students and Asian students reported
being in a physical fight anywhere. With regard to
the involvement of 9th- to 12th-graders in physical
fights on school property, the same patterns by race/
ethnicity were observed. The percentage of students
who reported being in a physical fight on school
property was higher for Black students (13 percent)
than for students of Two or more races (10 percent),
Hispanic students (9 percent), Pacific Islander
students (7 percent), White students (6 percent), and
Asian students (5 percent), and the percentages were
higher for students of Two or more races and Hispanic
students than for White students and Asian students.
Between 1993 and 2013, the percentage of students
in grades 9–12 who reported being in a physical
fight anywhere decreased for White students (from
40 to 21 percent), Hispanic students (from 43 to
28 percent), and American Indian/Alaska Native
students (from 50 to 32 percent). During the same
period, the percentage of students in grades 9–12 who
reported being in a physical fight on school property
decreased for White students (from 15 to 6 percent),
Black students (from 22 to 13 percent), and Hispanic
students (from 18 to 9 percent). The percentages of
Asian students who reported being in a physical fight
anywhere and on school property both decreased
between 1999 (the first year separate data on Asian
and Pacific Islander students were available) and
2013. The percentage of Pacific Islander students who
reported being in a physical fight on school property
also decreased between 1999 and 2013.

Students in grades 9–12 were also asked how often
they had been in physical fights during the previous
12 months. In 2013, about 19 percent of students
in these grades reported being in a physical fight
anywhere 1 to 3 times, 4 percent reported being in a
physical fight anywhere 4 to 11 times, and 2 percent
reported being in a physical fight anywhere 12 or
more times (figure 13.3 and table 13.2) during the
12-month period. When students in these grades were
asked about the incidence of physical fights on school
property during the 12-month period, 7  percent
reported being in a physical fight on school property
1 to 3 times, 1 percent reported being in a physical
fight on school property 4 to 11 times, and less than
1 percent reported being in a physical fight on school
property 12 or more times.
The percentages of both male and female 9th- to
12th-graders who reported being in a physical fight
both anywhere and on school property decreased
between 1993 and 2013. About 30 percent of male
students reported being in a physical fight anywhere
in 2013 compared with 51 percent in 1993, and
11 percent reported being in a physical fight on school
property in 2013 compared with 24 percent in 1993.
About 19 percent of female students reported being
in a physical fight anywhere in 2013 compared with
32 percent in 1993, and 6 percent reported being in
a physical fight on school property in 2013 compared
with 9 percent in 1993.
In 2013, a higher percentage of male than of female
9th- to 12th-graders reported being in a physical fight
during the previous 12 months (30 vs. 19 percent;

76

Fights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances

figure 13.3 and table 13.1). The reported frequency
of fights involving students in these grades was also
higher for males than for females (table 13.2). A
higher percentage of males than of females reported
being in a physical fight anywhere 1 to 3 times (22 vs.
16 percent), 4 to 11 times (5 vs. 3 percent), and 12 or
more times (3 vs. 1 percent) during the 12-month
period. Similar to the frequency of fights anywhere, in
2013, a higher percentage of males than of females in
grades 9 through 12 reported that they had been in a
physical fight on school property during the previous
12 months (11 vs. 6 percent). Additionally, a higher
percentage of males than of females reported being
in a physical fight on school property 1 to 3 times
(9 vs. 5 percent), 4 to 11 times (1 percent vs. less than
1 percent), and 12 or more times (1 percent vs. less
than 1 percent).
Data for the percentage of public school students who
reported being in a physical fight anywhere in 2013
were available for 37 states, and data for physical
fights on school property involving these students
were available for 35 states. Among these states,
the percentages of students who reported being in a
physical fight anywhere ranged from 17 percent in
Hawaii and Maine to 31 percent in Louisiana and
Mississippi, and the percentages of students who
reported being in a physical fight on school property
ranged from 5 percent in Massachusetts to 14 percent
in Mississippi and Maryland (table 13.3).

Indicator 14
Students Carrying Weapons on School Property and Anywhere
and Students’ Access to Firearms
Between 1993 and 2013, the percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported carrying a weapon on
school property at least 1 day during the previous 30 days declined from 12 to 5 percent. A higher percentage
of male students than of female students reported they had carried a weapon, both anywhere and on school
property, in every survey year from 1993 to 2013.
This indicator uses data from the Youth Risk Behavior
Survey (YRBS) to discuss students’ carrying of
weapons on school property and anywhere, then
uses state data from the EDFacts data collection to
discuss the numbers of incidents involving students
with firearms at school by state, and concludes with a
discussion of data from the School Crime Supplement
(SCS) survey on students’ access to firearms at school
or away from school. Readers should take note of the
differing data sources and terminology.

The percentage of students who reported carrying a
weapon on school property in the previous 30 days
declined from 12 percent in 1993 to 5 percent in 2013
(figure 14.1 and table 14.1). The percentage of students
who reported carrying weapons anywhere was lower
in 2013 (18 percent) than in 1993 (22 percent). There
were no measurable differences between the 2011 and
2013 percentages of students who reported carrying a
weapon either anywhere or on school property during
the previous 30 days.

In the YRBS, students were asked if they had carried
a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club anywhere in
the previous 30 days and if they had carried such a
weapon on school property during the same time
period.49 In this indicator, the percentage of students
carrying a weapon “anywhere”50 is included as a
point of comparison with the percentage of students
carrying a weapon on school property.

In every survey year from 1993 to 2013, a higher
percentage of male students than of female students
reported that they had carried a weapon, both
anywhere and on school property. In 2013, for
example, 28 percent of male students reported
carrying a weapon anywhere, compared with
8 percent of female students. In addition, 8 percent of
male students reported carrying a weapon on school
property, compared with 3 percent of female students.

In 2013, some 18 percent of students in grades 9–12
reported that they had carried a weapon anywhere
at least 1 day during the previous 30 days: 9 percent
reported carrying a weapon anywhere on 6 or more
days, 6 percent reported carrying a weapon on 2 to
5 days, and 3 percent reported carrying a weapon
on 1  day (tables 14.1 and 14.2). In comparison,
5 percent of students reported carrying a weapon on
school property at least 1 day during the previous
30 days. This percentage was composed of 3 percent
of students who reported carrying a weapon on 6
or more days, 1 percent of students who reported
carrying a weapon on 2 to 5 days, and 1 percent of
students who reported carrying a weapon on 1 day
during the 30-day period.

49
The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior
Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how
many days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days. In the
question asking students about carrying a weapon at school, “on
school property” was not defined for survey respondents.
50
“Anywhere” includes on school property.

In 2013, the percentage of White students who
reported carrying a weapon anywhere in the previous
30 days (21 percent) was higher than the percentages
of Hispanic students (16 percent), Pacific Islander and
Black students (13 percent each), and Asian students
(9 percent) who reported doing so (figure 14.2 and
table 14.1). In addition, higher percentages of students
of Two or more races (19 percent) and Hispanic
students than of Black students and Asian students
reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the
period. The percentage of American Indian/Alaska
Native students (18 percent) who reported carrying a
weapon anywhere was also higher than the percentage
of Asian students. With respect to students reporting
that they carried a weapon on school property during
the previous 30 days, a higher percentage of White
students (6 percent) than of Black students (4 percent)
reported that they had carried a weapon during the
previous 30 days.
Indicator 14 continued on page 80.

This indicator repeats student-reported information from the Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2014 report, and has been
updated to include 2013 data on discipline incidents related to weapons possession. For more information: Tables 14.1, 14.2,

There were no measurable differences by grade in
the percentages of students who reported carrying
a weapon anywhere or on school property at least
1 day during the previous 30 days in 2013: About
18 percent of students at each of grade levels 9 through
12 reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the
previous 30 days, and 5 percent each of 9th-, 10th-,
and 12th-graders and 6 percent of 11th-graders
reported carrying a weapon on school property.
However, a higher percentage of 12th-graders
(11 percent) than of 9th- and 10th-graders (8 percent
each) reported carrying a weapon anywhere on 6 or
more days during the previous 30 days (table 14.2).
In 2013, state-level data on percentages of public
school students who reported carrying a weapon
anywhere were available for 34 states (table 14.3).
Among these states, the percentages of students who
reported carrying a weapon anywhere ranged from
10 percent in New Jersey and Hawaii to 29 percent
in Wyoming. There were also 34 states that had 2013
data available on the percentages of students reporting
that they carried a weapon on school property during
the previous 30 days; the percentages ranged from
3 percent in New Jersey, Delaware, Massachusetts,
Wisconsin, and Nevada to 10 percent in Wyoming,
Montana, and Vermont.
Reported incidents involving students who brought
or possessed firearms at school are also important to
examine. As part of the EDFacts data collection, state
education agencies report the number of incidents
involving students who brought or possessed firearms
at school. State education agencies compile these data
based on incidents that were reported by their schools
and school districts. During the 2013–14 school year,
there were 1,501 reported firearm possession incidents
at schools (table 14.5). The total number of incidents
varies widely across states, due in large part to states’
differing populations. Therefore, the rate of firearm

80

Fights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances

possession incidents per 100,000 students can provide
a more comparable indication of the frequency of
these incidents across states. During the 2013–14
school year, the rate of firearm possession incidents
was 3 per 100,000 students in the United States.
The majority of states had rates between 1 and
10 firearm possession incidents per 100,000 students
from 2009–10 to 2013–14. Two states, Hawaii and
Maine, reported no firearm incidents during the
2013–14 school year and therefore had a rate of
0 firearm possession incidents per 100,000 students.
Four other states had rates of firearm possession
incidents per 100,000 students below 1. The four
states were Illinois, New Jersey, Iowa, and Maryland.
Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, and Iowa also had rates
below 1 during the 2012–13 school year. During the
2013–14 school year, three states had rates above 10:
Louisiana, Arkansas, and Vermont. However, of these
three states, only Arkansas also had a rate above 10
during the 2012–13 school year.
Information about students’ access to firearms can
put student reports of carrying a gun anywhere and
on school property into context. In the SCS survey,
students were asked if they could have gotten a loaded
gun without adult permission, either at school or
away from school, during the current school year.
In 2013, about 4 percent of students ages 12–18
reported having access to a loaded gun without
adult permission, either at school or away from
school, during the current school year (figure 14.3
and table  14.4). The percentage of 12- to 18-yearold students reporting that they had access to a
loaded gun without adult permission decreased from
7 percent in 2007 (the first year of data collection
for this item) to 4  percent in 2013. There was no
measurable difference between the percentages who
reported having such access to a loaded gun between
2011 and 2013.

In every survey year from 2007 to 2011, a higher
percentage of male students than of female students
ages 12–18 reported having access to a loaded gun
without adult permission. However, there was no
measurable difference between the percentages of
male and female students who reported having such
access to a loaded gun in 2013. The percentage of
male students who reported having access to a loaded
gun without adult permission was lower in 2013
than in 2011 (4 vs. 6 percent). The percentages of
female students who reported having such access to
a loaded gun were not measurably different between
these two years.

In 2013, higher percentages of 10th-, 11th-, and
12th-graders reported having access to a loaded
gun without adult permission than did 7th- and
8th-graders. About 5 percent of 10th-graders and
6 percent each of 11th- and 12th-graders reported
having access to a loaded gun without adult
supervision, compared with 2 percent each of 7thand 8th-graders. The percentage of 11th-graders
reporting that they had access to a gun without adult
supervision was also higher than the percentage of
9th-graders reporting such access (3 percent).

Indicator 15
Students’ Use of Alcohol and Alcohol-Related Discipline Incidents
Between 1993 and 2013, the percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported having at least one
drink of alcohol anywhere during the previous 30 days decreased from 48 to 35 percent. The percentage
who reported consuming alcohol in 2013 was lower than the percentage in 2011 (39 percent). In 2011,
some 5 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported having at least one drink of alcohol on school property.
This indicator uses data from the Youth Risk Behavior
Survey (YRBS) to discuss whether students had
consumed alcohol during the previous 30 days
on school property and anywhere, then uses state
data from the EDFacts data collection to discuss
the number of discipline incidents resulting in the
removal of a student for at least an entire school day
that involve students’ possession or use of alcohol
on school grounds. Readers should take note of the
differing data sources and terminology.
In the 2013 YRBS, students in grades 9–12 were
asked if they had consumed alcohol on at least 1 day
during the previous 30 days. Prior to 2013, students
were also asked if they had consumed alcohol on
school property51 during the previous 30 days. Due
to this change in the questionnaire, this indicator first
discusses results on alcohol consumption anywhere
using data up to 2013 and then discusses students’
reports of alcohol consumption on school property
using data up to 2011.
Between 1993 and 2013, the percentage of students
in grades 9–12 who reported having at least one drink
of alcohol during the previous 30 days decreased
from 48 to 35 percent (figure 15.1 and table 15.1).
Additionally, the percentage who reported consuming
alcohol in 2013 was lower than the percentage in 2011
(39 percent). In 2013, about 17 percent of students
in grades 9–12 reported consuming alcohol on
1 or 2 days during the previous 30 days, 17 percent
reported consuming alcohol on 3 to 29 of the previous
30 days, and 1 percent reported consuming alcohol on
all of the previous 30 days (table 15.2). The percentage
of students who reported consuming alcohol on 1
or 2 days was lower in 2013 than in 2011 (17 vs.
19 percent).
In every survey year between 1993 and 2001, except
in 1995, a higher percentage of males than of females
reported consuming alcohol on at least 1 day during
the previous 30 days. However, in the survey years

since 2003, there have been no measurable differences
between the percentages of male and female students
who reported consuming alcohol on at least 1 of the
previous 30 days. Nevertheless, there were differences
by sex in the number of days students reported
consuming alcohol in 2013. A higher percentage of
females than of males reported consuming alcohol
on 1 or 2 days (19 vs. 16 percent). In contrast, a
higher percentage of males than of females reported
consuming alcohol on all of the previous 30 days
(1 percent vs. less than one-half of 1 percent; figure
15.2 and table 15.2).
In 2013, the percentage of students who reported
consuming alcohol increased with grade level. About
47 percent of 12th-graders reported consuming
alcohol on at least 1 day during the previous
30 days (figure 15.3 and table 15.1). This percentage
was higher than the percentages for 9th-graders
(24  percent), 10th-graders (31 percent), and 11thgraders (39 percent; table 15.2). Additionally, higher
percentages of Hispanic students (37 percent),
White students and students of Two or more
races (36 percent each), American Indian/Alaska
Native students (33 percent), and Black students
(30  percent) than of Asian students (22 percent)
reported consuming alcohol on at least 1 day during
the previous 30 days in 2013. The percentage of Black
students who reported consuming alcohol on at least
1 day was lower than the percentages reported by
White students, Hispanic students, and students of
Two or more races.
In 2013, state-level data on the percentages of students
who reported consuming alcohol were available
for 41  states (table 15.3). Among these states, the
percentages of students who reported drinking
alcohol on at least 1 day during the previous 30 days
ranged from 11 percent in Utah to 39 percent in
Louisiana and New Jersey.

In the question about drinking alcohol at school, “on school
property” was not defined for survey respondents.

This indicator has been updated to include 2013 data on discipline incidents related to alcohol. For more information: Tables 15.1,

Prior to 2013, data were also collected on student
alcohol consumption on school property during the
previous 30 days. In 2011, some 5 percent of students
in grades 9–12 reported having at least one drink of
alcohol on school property, which was not measurably
different from the percentage in 1993 (figure 15.1 and
table 15.1). About 3 percent of students reported using
alcohol on school property on 1 or 2 of the previous
30 days in 2011. One percent of students reported
using alcohol on school property on 3 to 29 of the
previous 30 days, and less than one percent of students
reported using alcohol on school property on all of
the previous 30 days (table 15.2).
Higher percentages of American Indian/Alaska
Native students (21 percent) and Hispanic students
(7 percent) than of Black students (5 percent), White
students (4 percent), and Asian students (3 percent)
reported alcohol consumption on school property in
2011. However, there were no measurable differences
in the percentages of students who reported
consuming alcohol on at least 1 day on school
property in 2011 by sex and grade level.
In 2011, state-level data on the percentages of students
who reported using alcohol on at least 1 day during
the previous 30 days on school property were available
for 37 states and the District of Columbia (table 15.3).
Among these states, the percentages of students who
reported drinking alcohol on school property ranged
from 2 percent in Indiana and Iowa to 7 percent in
the District of Columbia.

It is also important to examine discipline incidents
that result from possession or use of alcohol at school,
which reflect disruptions in the educational process
and provide a gauge for the scope of alcohol use at
school. As part of the EDFacts data collection, state
education agencies report the number of discipline
incidents resulting in the removal of a student for
at least an entire school day that involve students’
possession or use of alcohol on school grounds.
State education agencies compile these data based
on incidents that were reported by their schools
and school districts. During the 2013–14 school
year, there were 24,000 reported alcohol-related
discipline incidents in the United States (table
15.4).52 The number of alcohol-related incidents
varies widely across states, due in large part to states’
differing populations. Therefore, the rate of alcoholrelated discipline incidents per 100,000 students
can provide a more comparable indication of the
frequency of these incidents across states. During
the 2013–14 school year, the rate of alcohol-related
discipline incidents was 48 per 100,000 students in
the United States.
The majority of states had rates between 10 and
100 alcohol-related discipline incidents per 100,000
students during the 2013–14 school year. Texas and
Wyoming had rates of alcohol-related discipline
incidents per 100,000 students that were at or below
10. Tennessee, Montana, and Washington had rates
above 100.

Indicator 16
Students’ Use of Marijuana on School Property and Anywhere
In 2013, some 23 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported using marijuana at least one time in the
previous 30 days, which was higher than the percentage reported in 1993 (18 percent). In 2011, some
6  percent of students reported using marijuana at least one time on school property.
The 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey asked students
in grades 9–12 whether they had used marijuana in
the previous 30 days. Prior to 2013, students were
also asked whether they had used marijuana on school
property53 in the previous 30 days. Due to this change
in the questionnaire, this indicator differs from
previous editions; it first discusses students’ reports of
marijuana use anywhere using data up to 2013, and
then discusses students’ reports of marijuana use on
school property using data up to 2011.
In 2013, some 23 percent of students in grades
9–12 reported using marijuana at least one time in
the previous 30 days, which was higher than the
percentage reported in 1993 (18 percent) but not
measurably different from that reported in 2011
(figure 16.1 and table 16.1). In 2013, about 7 percent
of students in grades 9–12 reported using marijuana
1 or 2 times during the previous 30 days, 11 percent
reported using marijuana 3 to 39 times during the
previous 30 days, and 5 percent reported using
marijuana 40 or more times during the previous 30
days (table 16.2).
In every survey year between 1993 and 2011, higher
percentages of male students than of female students
reported using marijuana at least one time in the
previous 30 days; in 2013, there was no measurable
difference in the percentages reported by male and
female students (25 and 22 percent, respectively;

figure  16.1 and table 16.1). However, a higher
percentage of males (7 percent) than of females
(3 percent) reported using marijuana 40 or more times
during the previous 30 days in 2013 (figure 16.2 and
table 16.2).
In 2013, some differences in the percentages of
students who reported marijuana use were observed
by race/ethnicity and grade level. The percentages
of Asian students (16 percent) and White students
(20 percent) who reported using marijuana during
the previous 30 days were lower than the percentages
reported by Hispanic students (28 percent), Black
students and students of Two or more races (29 percent
each), and American Indian/Alaska Native students
(36 percent; figure 16.3 and table 16.1). In addition,
the percentage of students in 9th grade (18 percent)
who reported using marijuana was lower than the
percentages of students in 10th grade (23 percent),
11th grade (26 percent), and 12th grade (28 percent)
who reported doing so.
In 2013, state-level data for students who reported
using marijuana at least one time in the previous
30  days were available for 42 states (table 16.3).
Among these states, the percentages of students who
reported using marijuana ranged from 8 percent in
Utah to 28 percent in New Mexico.
Indicator 16 continued on page 88.

In the question about using marijuana at school, “on school
property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term
“anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey
(YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many
times during the previous 30 days they had used marijuana.

Prior to 2013, data were also collected on students’
marijuana use on school property during the previous
30 days. Some 6 percent of students reported using
marijuana at least one time on school property in
2011; this was not measurably different from the
percentage reported in 1993 but was higher than
the percentage reported in 2009 (5 percent; figure
16.1  and table 16.1). In 2011, about 3 percent of
students reported using marijuana on school property
1 or 2 times in the previous 30 days, about 2 percent
reported using marijuana 3 to 39 times during the
previous 30 days, and 1 percent reported using
marijuana 40 or more times during the previous
30 days (table 16.2).
In every survey year between 1993 and 2011, higher
percentages of male students than of female students
reported using marijuana on school property at least
one time in the previous 30 days (figure 16.1 and
table 16.1). For example, 8 percent of male students
reported using marijuana on school property in
2011, compared with 4 percent of female students.

In 2011, a higher percentage of American Indian/
Alaska Native students (21 percent) than of students

marijuana on school property at least one time in the
previous 30 days. Additionally, a higher percentage
of Hispanic students (8 percent) than of White
or Asian students (5 and 4 percent, respectively)
reported using marijuana on school property, and
a higher percentage of Black students (7 percent)
than of White students reported doing so. There
were no measurable differences by grade level in the
percentages of students reporting marijuana use on
school property in 2011.
In 2011, state-level data for students who reported
using marijuana on school property at least one time
in the previous 30 days were available for 36 states and
the District of Columbia (table 16.3). Among these

Indicator 17
Students’ Perceptions of Personal Safety at School and Away
From School
The percentage of students who reported being afraid of attack or harm at school decreased from 12 percent
in 1995 to 3 percent in 2013, and the percentage of students who reported being afraid of attack or harm
away from school decreased from 6 percent in 1999 to 3 percent in 2013.
In the School Crime Supplement to the National
Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18
were asked how often54 they had been afraid of
attack or harm “at school or on the way to and from
school” as well as “away from school.”55 In 2013,
about 3 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that
they were afraid of attack or harm at school or on the
way to and from school during the school year (figure
17.1 and table 17.1). Similarly, 3 percent of students
ages 12–18 reported that they were afraid of attack
or harm away from school during the school year.
Between 1995 and 2013, the percentages of students
who reported being afraid of attack or harm at school
decreased overall (from 12 to 3 percent), as well as
among male students (from 11 to 3 percent) and
female students (from 13 to 4 percent; figure 17.1).
In addition, the percentage of students who reported
being afraid of attack or harm at school decreased
between 1995 and 2013 for White students (from
8 to 3 percent), Black students (from 20 to 5 percent),
and Hispanic students (from 21 to 5 percent).
A declining trend was also observed for away from
school: between 1999 (the first year of data collection
for this item) and 2013, the percentage of students
who reported being afraid of attack or harm decreased
from 6 to 3 percent overall, from 4 to 2 percent for
male students, and from 7 to 3 percent for female
students. The percentages of White students (from
4 to 2 percent), Black students (from 9 to 4 percent),
and Hispanic students (from 9 to 4 percent) who
reported being afraid of attack or harm away from
54
Students were asked if they “never,” “almost never,”
“sometimes,” or “most of the time” feared that someone would
attack or harm them at school or away from school. Students
responding “sometimes” or “most of the time” were considered
fearful. For the 2001 survey only, the wording was changed from
“attack or harm” to “attack or threaten to attack.”
55
“At school” includes the school building, on school property,
on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and
from school.

school also decreased during this period. Between
the two most recent survey years, 2011 and 2013,
no measurable differences were found in the overall
percentages of students who reported being afraid of
attack or harm, either at school or away from school.
In 2013, higher percentages of Black and Hispanic
students (5 percent each) than of White students
(3 percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm
at school (table 17.1). Similarly, higher percentages of
Black and Hispanic students (4 percent each) than
of White students (2 percent) reported being afraid
of attack or harm away from school.
Higher percentages of 6th-graders (5 percent) and
7th- and 10th-graders (4 percent each) reported
being afraid of attack or harm at school than
did 12th-graders (2 percent) in 2013. Likewise,
higher percentages of 6th-, 9th-, and 10th-graders
(3 to 4  percent each) reported being afraid of attack
or harm away from school than did 12th-graders
(1 percent).
In 2013, higher percentages of students in urban
areas than of students in suburban areas reported
being afraid of attack or harm both at school and
away from school (figure 17.2). Specifically, 4 percent
of students in urban areas reported being afraid of
attack or harm at school, compared with 3 percent
of students in suburban areas. Similarly, 4 percent
of students in urban areas reported being afraid of
attack or harm away from school, higher than the
2 percent of students in suburban areas. In addition,
a higher percentage of students in urban areas than of
students in rural areas reported being afraid of attack
or harm away from school (4 vs. 2 percent). There were
no measurable differences between the percentages
of public school and private school students who
reported being afraid of attack or harm at school or
away from school in 2013.

Starting in 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period was the previous 6 months.
Cognitive testing showed that estimates from 2007 onward are comparable to previous years.
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. Students
were asked if they “never,” “almost never,” “sometimes,” or “most of the time” feared that someone would attack or harm them at school or away
from school. Students responding “sometimes” or “most of the time” were considered fearful. For the 2001 survey only, the wording was changed
from “attack or harm” to “attack or threaten to attack.” Data on fear of attack or harm away from school were not collected in 1995. For more
information, please see appendix A.

Indicator 18
Students’ Reports of Avoiding School Activities or Classes or
Specific Places in School
In 2013, about 5 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they avoided school activities or classes or
one or more places in school because they thought someone might attack or harm them.
The School Crime Supplement to the National
Crime Victimization Survey asked students ages
12–18 whether they avoided school activities or
classes56 or one or more places in school57 because
they were fearful that someone might attack or harm
them.58 In 2013, about 5 percent of students reported
that they avoided at least one school activity or class
or one or more places in school during the previous
school year because they feared being attacked or
harmed. Specifically, 2 percent of students reported
avoiding at least one school activity or class, and
about 4 percent reported avoiding one or more places
in school (figure 18.1 and table 18.1).
There was no overall pattern of increase or decrease
between 1999 and 2013 in the percentage of students
who reported that they avoided at least one school
activity or class or one or more places in school
because of fear of attack or harm. The percentage in
2013 (5 percent) was lower than the percentage in
1999 (7 percent) but not measurably different from
the percentage in 2011.

In 2013, about 1 percent each of students reported
that they avoided any activities, avoided any classes,
and stayed home from school. With respect to
avoiding specific places in school, 2 percent of
students reported that they avoided the hallways or
stairs in school, and 1 percent each reported that
they avoided parts of the school cafeteria, any school
restrooms, the entrance to the school, and other places
inside the school building.
Students’ reports of avoiding one or more places
in school because of fear of attack or harm varied
by some student and school characteristics in 2013
(figure 18.2). A higher percentage of Hispanic
students (5  percent) than of White students
(3 percent) reported avoiding one or more places in
school. By grade, higher percentages of 7th-graders
and 9th-graders (5 percent each) than of 8th-graders
(3 percent), 11th-graders (3 percent), or 12th-graders
(2 percent) reported avoiding one or more places in
school. Also, a higher percentage of public school
students (4 percent) than of private school students
(1 percent) reported avoiding one or more places
in  school.

56
“Avoided school activities or classes” includes student reports
of three activities: avoiding any (extracurricular) activities,
avoiding any classes, or staying home from school. Before 2007,
students were asked whether they avoided “any extracurricular
activities.” Starting in 2007, the survey wording was changed
to “any activities.” Caution should be used when comparing
changes in this item over time.
57
“Avoiding one or more places in school” includes student
reports of five activities: avoiding the entrance, any hallways or
stairs, parts of the cafeteria, restrooms, and other places inside
the school building.
58
For the 2001 survey only, the wording was changed from
“attack or harm” to “attack or threaten to attack.” See appendix
A for more information.

Indicator 19
Serious Disciplinary Actions Taken by Public Schools
During the 2011–12 school year, 3.4 million public school students in the United States received in-school
suspensions and 3.2 million received out-of-school suspensions. The percentage of Black students receiving
out-of-school suspensions (15 percent) was higher than the percentages for students of any other racial/
ethnic group.
This indicator uses two different universe data
collections to provide information on discipline in
public schools. First, data from the Civil Rights
Data Collection (CRDC) are used to discuss the
number and percentage of students receiving various
disciplinary actions (e.g., suspensions, expulsions,
school-related arrests). The indicator then uses state
data from the EDFacts data collection to discuss
the number and rate of discipline incidents related
to alcohol, drugs, violence, or weapons possession
that resulted in a student being removed from the
education setting for at least an entire school day.
Readers should take note of the differing data sources
and terminology.
The CRDC provides data on the number of students
who were disciplined during the 2011–12 school year
by the type of action taken: suspensions (both inschool and out-of-school), expulsions, referrals to law
enforcement,59 school-related arrests,60 and corporal
punishments.61 During the 2011–12 school year,
3.4 million students in the United States received
in-school suspensions and 3.2 million received outof-school suspensions (table 19.1). The number of
students who were suspended can also be expressed
as a percentage of students enrolled.62 Seven percent
59

Referral to law enforcement is an action by which a student
is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including
a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school
grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school
transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken.
60
A school-related arrest is an arrest of a student for any activity
conducted on school grounds, during off-campus school
activities (including while taking school transportation), or due
to a referral by any school official.
61
Corporal punishment is paddling, spanking, or other forms
of physical punishment imposed on a student.
62
The percentage of students receiving a disciplinary action
is calculated by dividing the cumulative number of students
receiving that type of disciplinary action for the entire
2011–12 school year by the student enrollment based on a
count of students taken on a single day between September 27
and December 31. The CRDC provides a count of students who
received disciplinary actions; thus, a student who was suspended
multiple times during a school year might be counted only once
in the CRDC.

of students received an in-school suspension and
6 percent received an out-of-school suspension in
2011–12 (table 19.2). Less than 1 percent of students
received each of the following disciplinary actions:
referral to law enforcement, corporal punishment,
expulsion, and school-related arrest.
T he CR DC a lso prov ide s informat ion on
characteristics of students receiving disciplinary
actions, including students’ sex and race/ethnicity.63
There were differences by both sex and race/ethnicity
in the percentage of students who received out-ofschool suspensions in 2011–12. The percentage of
Black students receiving out-of-school suspensions
(15 percent) was higher than the percentages for
students of all other racial/ethnic groups (figure 19.1).
In contrast, a lower percentage of Asian students
(1 percent) received out-of-school suspensions than
students from any other racial/ethnic group.
A higher percentage of male students (9 percent)
than female students (4 percent) received an outof-school suspension in 2011–12. This pattern of
higher percentages of male than female students
being suspended held across all racial/ethnic groups.
In addition, differences by race/ethnicity for male
and female students were similar to the overall
differences by race/ethnicity. Among males, the
percentage of Black students who received an out-ofschool suspension (20 percent) was almost twice the
percentage of American Indian/Alaska Native students
(10 percent), and more than twice the percentages of
students of Two or more races (9 percent), Hispanic
students (8 percent), White students (6 percent),
Pacific Islander students (5  percent), and Asian
students (2 percent). Similarly, the percentage of
Black female students who received an out-of-school
suspension (11 percent) was more than twice the

NOTE: Excludes data for students with disabilities served only under Section 504. The percentage of students receiving a disciplinary action is
calculated by dividing the cumulative number of students receiving that type of disciplinary action for the entire 2011–12 school year by the student
enrollment based on a count of students taken on a single day between September 27 and December 31. Race categories exclude persons of
Hispanic ethnicity.

percentages of female students of any other race/
ethnicity. The pattern of greater percentages of Black
males and females receiving disciplinary actions than
males and females of any other race/ethnicity was also
evident for student expulsions.
The CRDC allows for state-level comparisons of
the percentage of students who received various
disciplinary actions. In the majority of states,
between 3 and 10 percent of students received an
out-of-school suspension during the 2011–12 school
year (table 19.3). In Hawaii, North Dakota, and
Utah, the percentage of students receiving an outof-school suspension was less than 3 percent. More
than 10 percent of students received an out-of-school
suspension in the District of Columbia, Florida,
South Carolina, Mississippi, and Delaware.

As part of the EDFacts data collection, state education
agencies (SEAs) report the number of discipline
incidents resulting in the removal of a student for
at least an entire school day for specific reasons:
possession or use of alcohol on school grounds,
possession or use of tobacco or illicit drugs on school
grounds, a violent incident with or without physical
injury, and weapons possession. Unlike the CRDC,
where the reasons for disciplinary actions are not
available, the EDFacts data can be used to examine
the magnitude of the specific types of discipline
incidents listed above.64 SEAs compile these data
based on incidents that were reported by their schools
and school districts.65 SEAs are not required to report
discipline incidents that are not a result of alcohol,
drugs, violence, or weapons possession.
64

EDFacts data represent a count of specific discipline incidents,
while the CRDC provides a count of students who received
disciplinary actions. Thus, a student who was suspended
multiple times during a school year might be counted once
in the CRDC, but multiple times in EDFacts provided each
incident met the inclusion criteria.
65
EDFacts is compiled by state education agencies, while the
CRDC is generally filled out by district- or school-level staff.

During the 2013 –14 school year, there were
1.3 million reported discipline incidents in the United
States for reasons related to alcohol, drugs, violence,
or weapons possession (table 19.4).66 About 78 percent
of these discipline incidents were violent incidents
with or without physical injury (figure 19.2). Fifteen
percent of these discipline incidents were illicit drug
related, 5  percent were weapons possessions, and
2 percent were alcohol related.
The number of discipline incidents can also be
expressed as a ratio of discipline incidents per 100,000
students. During the 2013–14 school year, there were
2,615 reported discipline incidents related to alcohol,
drugs, violence, or weapons possession per 100,000
students in the United States.

Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures

The total number of discipline incidents for reasons
related to alcohol, drugs, violence, and weapons
possession varies widely across states, due in large
part to states’ differing populations. Therefore, the
ratio of such discipline incidents per 100,000 students
can provide a more comparable indication of the
frequency of these incidents across states. The majority
of states had ratios between 500 and 5,000 alcohol-,
drug-, violence-, or weapons possession-related
discipline incidents per 100,000 students during
the 2013–14 school year. Three states had ratios
per 100,000 students that were below 500: Texas,
Idaho, and Delaware. Rhode Island, the District
of Columbia, Colorado, Louisiana, Kentucky, and
Alabama had ratios per 100,000 students that were
above 5,000.

Indicator 20
Safety and Security Measures Taken by Public Schools
In the 2013–14 school year, about 88 percent of public schools reported they had a written plan for
procedures to be performed in the event of a shooting, and 70 percent of these schools had drilled students
on the use of the plan.
Schools use a variety of practices and procedures to
promote the safety of students, faculty, and staff.
Certain practices, such as locking or monitoring doors
and gates, are intended to limit or control access to
school campuses, while others, such as the use of
metal detectors and security cameras, are intended
to monitor or restrict students’ and visitors’ behavior
on campus. In the 2013–14 school year, principals of
public schools were asked about their schools’ use of
safety and security measures and procedures in the
Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) survey of school
safety and discipline. Another measure of safety
and security, collected in the FRSS survey of school
safety and discipline, is the presence of security staff
in public schools during the school year. Principals
were also asked to report whether their school had
a written plan for procedures to be performed in
selected crises, as well as whether they had drilled
students during the current school year on the use
of a plan. In prior years, data on safety and security
measures and procedures, presence of security staff
at school, and written and drilled plans for selected
crises were collected from the School Survey on Crime
and Safety (SSOCS).
In the 2013–14 school year, 93 percent of public
schools reported that they controlled access to school
buildings by locking or monitoring doors during
school hours (table 20.1). Other safety and security
measures reported by public schools included the use
of security cameras to monitor the school (75 percent),
a requirement that faculty and staff wear badges or
picture IDs (68 percent), and the enforcement of a

strict dress code (58 percent). In addition, 24 percent
of public schools reported the use of random dog sniffs
to check for drugs, 20 percent required that students
wear uniforms, 9 percent required students to wear
badges or picture IDs, and 4 percent used random
metal detector checks.
Use of various safety and security procedures differed
by school level during the 2013–14 school year
(figure 20.1 and table 20.2). For example, higher
percentages of public primary schools and public
middle schools than of public high schools and
combined elementary/secondary schools (referred
to as high/combined schools) controlled access to
school buildings and required faculty and staff to
wear badges or picture IDs. Additionally, a higher
percentage of primary schools required students to
wear uniforms (23  percent) than high/combined
schools (15 percent). Conversely, higher percentages
of high/combined schools and middle schools than of
primary schools reported the enforcement of a strict
dress code; a requirement that students wear badges
or picture IDs; and the use of random metal detector
checks. A higher percentage of high/combined schools
reported the use of security cameras to monitor the
school (89 percent) than middle schools (84 percent),
and both of these percentages were higher than the
percentage of primary schools (67 percent) that
reported the use of security cameras. The same pattern
was evident for the use of random dog sniffs.

In 2013–14, use of various safety and security
procedures also differed by school size. A higher
percentage of public schools with 1,000 or more
students enrolled than those with fewer students
enrolled reported the use of security cameras, a
requirement that students wear badges or picture IDs,
use of random dog sniffs, and use of random metal
detector checks (table 20.2). A lower percentage of
schools with less than 300 students enrolled reported
that they required faculty and staff to wear badges
or picture IDs (46 percent) than schools with greater
numbers of students enrolled.

percentages of students eligible for free or reducedprice lunch. Conversely, a lower percentage of schools
where 76 percent or more of students were eligible
for free or reduced-price lunch reported the use of
random dog sniffs (14 percent) than schools where
lower percentages of students were eligible for free or
reduced-price lunch. A higher percentage of schools
where 25 percent or less of students were eligible for
free or reduced-price lunch reported requiring faculty
and staff to wear badges or picture IDs (82 percent)
than schools where higher percentages of students
were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch.

A higher percentage of public schools located in
cities than those in suburban areas, towns, and rural
areas reported that they enforced a strict dress code,
required students to wear uniforms, and used random
metal detector checks in 2013–14 (table 20.2). A
higher percentage of schools in suburban areas
required faculty or staff to wear badges or picture IDs
(79 percent) than those in towns (67 percent), cities
(67 percent), and rural areas (60 percent). Random
dog sniffs were reported by a higher percentage of
public schools in rural areas (35 percent) and towns
(32 percent) than suburban areas (19 percent) and
cities (11 percent).

The percentages of public schools reporting the use
of various safety and security measures in 2013–14
tended to be higher than in prior years (figure 20.2
and table 20.1). For example, the percentage of
public schools reporting the use of security cameras
increased from 19 percent in 1999–2000 to 75 percent
in 2013–14. Similarly, the percentage of public
schools reporting that they controlled access to school
buildings increased from 75 percent to 93 percent
during this time. From 1999–2000 to 2013–14, the
following safety and security measures also increased:
requiring faculty and staff to wear badges or picture
IDs, enforcing a strict dress code, use of random
dog sniffs, requiring school uniforms, and requiring
students to wear badges or picture IDs. Conversely,
the percentage of schools that reported using random
metal detector checks decreased from 7 percent in
1999–2000 to 4 percent in 2013–14.

Many safety and security measures tended to be
more prevalent in schools where 76 percent or more
of students were eligible for free or reduced-price
lunch (table 20.2). A higher percentage of these
schools reported they enforced a strict dress code,
required school uniforms, and required students to
wear badges or picture IDs than schools with lower

NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. Data for 2013–14
were collected using the Fast Response Survey System, while data for earlier years were collected using the School Survey on Crime and Safety
(SSOCS). The 2013–14 survey was designed to allow comparisons with SSOCS data. However, respondents to the 2013–14 survey could choose
either to complete the survey on paper (and mail it back) or to complete the survey online, whereas respondents to SSOCS did not have the option
of completing the survey online. The 2013–14 survey also relied on a smaller sample. The smaller sample size and change in survey administration
may have impacted 2013–14 results.

In the 2013–14 school year, 43 percent of public
schools reported the presence of one or more security
guards, security personnel, School Resource Officers,
or sworn law enforcement officers at their school
at least once a week during the school year (table
20.3).67 The percentage of public schools reporting
the presence of security staff did not differ measurably
between 2013–14 and prior years in which data on
this item were collected. However, the percentage
of public schools reporting the presence of full-time
security staff was lower in 2013–14 (24 percent) than
in prior years, while the percentage of public schools
reporting part-time-only security staff in 2013–14
(19 percent) was higher than it was in prior years.
About 29 percent of public primary schools reported
the presence of one or more security staff at their
school at least once a week in 2013–14. The percentage
of primary schools reporting security staff was lower
than the percentages of middle schools and high/
combined schools reporting the presence of security
staff (63 and 64 percent, respectively).
Differences in the presence of security staff were also
found by other school characteristics. Public schools
with greater numbers of students were more likely
to report the presence of security staff. For example,
22  percent of schools with less than 300 students

67
Security guards or security personnel do not include law
enforcement. School Resource Officers include all career law
enforcement officers with arrest authority who have specialized
training and are assigned to work in collaboration with school
organizations. Sworn law enforcement includes sworn law
enforcement officers who are not School Resource Officers.

enrolled reported the presence of security staff at least
once a week, compared with 87 percent of schools
with 1,000 or more students enrolled. The percentage
of public schools in rural areas that reported the
presence of one or more security staff at least once
a week during the 2013–14 school year (36 percent)
was lower than the percentages of schools in cities
(45 percent), suburban areas (48 percent), and towns
(48 percent).
Another aspect of school safety and security is
ensuring plans are in place to be enacted in the event
of a crisis situation. In 2013–14, about 94 percent of
public schools reported they had a written plan for
procedures to be performed in the event of a natural
disaster (figure 20.3 and table 20.4).68 Eighty-three
percent of these schools reported that they had drilled
students on the use of the plan. About 88 percent of
public schools reported they had a plan for procedures
to be performed in the event of a shooting, and
70 percent of these schools had drilled students on
the use of the plan. Public schools also reported
having plans in place for bomb threats or incidents
(88  percent); chemical, biological, or radiological
threats or incidents 69 (60 percent); and hostages
(50 percent).

Indicator 21
Students’ Reports of Safety and Security Measures Observed
at School
In 2013, about 77 percent of students ages 12–18 reported observing one or more security cameras to
monitor the school during the day at their schools, and 76 percent of students reported observing locked
entrance or exit doors during the day.
In the School Crime Supplement to the National
Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18
were asked whether their schools used certain
security measures.70 Security measures include metal
detectors, locker checks, security cameras, security
guards or assigned police officers, adults supervising
hallways, badges or picture identification for students,
a written code of student conduct, locked entrance
or exit doors during the day, and a requirement that
visitors sign in. In 2013, nearly all students ages 12–18
reported that they observed the use of at least one of
the selected security measures at their schools (figure
21.1 and table 21.1).
In 2013, most students ages 12–18 reported that their
schools had a written code of student conduct and a
requirement that visitors sign in (96 percent each).
Approximately 90 percent of students reported the
presence of school staff (other than security guards
or assigned police officers) or other adults supervising
the hallway, 77 percent reported the use of one or
more security cameras at their schools, and 76 percent
reported locked entrance or exit doors during the day.
About 70 percent of students reported the presence
of security guards and/or assigned police officers,
52 percent reported locker checks, and 26 percent
reported that students were required to wear badges or
picture identification at their schools. Eleven percent
of students reported the use of metal detectors at their
schools, representing the least observed of the selected
safety and security measures.
The percentage of students who reported locked
entrance or exit doors during the day increased

between the two most recent survey years, as well
as over the past 14 years. Specifically, 76 percent of
students reported observing locked entrance or exit
doors during the day in 2013, representing an increase
from 65 percent in 2011, as well as an overall increase
from 38 percent in 1999. The percentage of students
who reported the presence of school staff (other than
security guards or assigned police officers) or other
adults supervising the hallway also was higher in
2013 (90 percent) than in 2011 (89 percent) and in
1999 (85 percent).
The percentage of students who reported the presence
of metal detectors at school increased from 1999 to
2013 (from 9 to 11 percent), as did the percentage
of students who reported the presence of security
guards and/or assigned police officers (from 54 to
70  percent) and the percentage of students who
reported a requirement that visitors sign in (from 87 to
96 percent). Beginning in 2001, students were asked
whether they observed the use of security cameras
at school and whether they were required to wear
badges or picture identification. From 2001 to 2013,
the percentage of students who reported the use of
one or more security cameras at school increased from
39 to 77 percent, and the percentage of students who
reported that they were required to wear badges or
picture identification increased from 21 to 26 percent.
No measurable differences were found between the
two most recent survey years (2011 and 2013) in the
percentages of students reporting these safety and
security measures.

70
Readers should note that this indicator relies on student
reports of security measures and provides estimates based on
students’ awareness of the measure rather than on documented
practice. See Indicator 20 for a summary of the use of various
security measures as reported by schools.

This indicator repeats information from the Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2014 report. For more information: Table

Indicator 22
Criminal Incidents at Postsecondary Institutions
In 2013, about 27,600 criminal incidents on campuses at postsecondary institutions were reported to police
and security agencies, representing an 8 percent decrease from 2012 (29,800 incidents). The number of
on-campus crimes reported per 10,000 full-time-equivalent students also decreased, from 19.8 in 2012
to 18.4 in 2013.
Since 1990, postsecondary institutions participating
in Title IV federal student financial aid programs
have been required to comply with the Jeanne Clery
Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus
Crime Statistics Act, known as the Clery Act. The Clery
Act requires institutions to give timely warnings about
crimes to students and staff; to publicly report campus
crime and safety policies; and to collect, report, and
disseminate campus crime data. Since 1999, data on
campus safety and security have been reported by
institutions through the Campus Safety and Security
Survey. These reports include on-campus criminal
offenses and arrests involving students, faculty,
staff, and the general public. Reports on referrals
for disciplinary action primarily deal with persons
associated formally with the institution (i.e., students,
faculty, and other staff).
In 2013, there were 27,600 criminal incidents against
persons and property on campus at public and
private 2-year and 4-year postsecondary institutions
that were reported to police and security agencies,
representing an 8 percent decrease from 2012 (29,800
incidents; table 22.1). The number of on-campus
crimes per 10,000 full-time-equivalent (FTE)
students71 also decreased, from 19.8 in 2012 to 18.4
in 2013 (table 22.2).
Among the various types of on-campus crimes reported
in 2013, there were 15,500 burglaries,72 constituting
56 percent of all criminal incidents (table 22.1). Other
commonly reported crimes  included forcible sex
offenses (5,000 incidents, or 18 percent of crimes) and
motor vehicle theft (3,000 incidents, or 11 percent
of crimes). In addition, 2,100 aggravated assaults
and 1,300 robberies73 were reported. These estimates
translate to 10.3 burglaries, 3.3 forcible sex offenses,
2.0 motor vehicle thefts, 1.4 aggravated assaults, and
0.9 robberies per 10,000 FTE students (table 22.2).
71
The base of 10,000 FTE students includes students who are
enrolled exclusively in distance learning courses and who may
not be physically present on campus.
72
Unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or theft.
73
Taking or attempting to take anything of value using actual or
threatened force or violence.

Looking at on-campus crime patterns over a longer
period, the overall number of crimes reported
between 2001 and 2013 decreased by 34 percent
(figure 22.1 and table 22.1). Although the number
of reported on-campus crimes increased by 7 percent
between 2001 and 2006 (from 41,600 to 44,500),
it decreased by 38 percent between 2006 and 2013
(from 44,500 to 27,600). The number of on-campus
crimes reported in 2013 was lower than in 2001
for every category except forcible sex offenses and
murder. The number of reported forcible sex crimes
on campus increased from 2,200 in 2001 to 5,000
in 2013 (a 126 percent increase). More recently, the
number of reported forcible sex crimes increased by
almost a quarter between 2012 and 2013, from 4,000
to 5,000. Twenty-three murders were reported on
college campuses in 2013, which was higher than
the numbers reported in 2012 (12) or in 2001 (17).
Increases in FTE college enrollment between 2001
and 2013 as well as changes in the number of
crimes affected the number of on-campus crimes
per 10,000 FTE students (see Digest of Education
Statistics 2014 for details about college enrollment).
Overall, the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000
students decreased from 35.6 in 2001 to 18.4 in 2013
(figure   22.1 and table 22.2). Between 2001 and
2006, both enrollment and the number of on-campus
crimes increased. However, because enrollment
increased by a larger percentage than the number of
crimes, the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000
students was actually lower in 2006 (33.3) than in
2001 (35.6). Between 2006 and 2013, the number
of reported on-campus crimes decreased, enrollment
increased, and the number of on-campus crimes per
10,000 students decreased from 33.3 to 18.4. The
rates per 10,000 students for all types of reported
on-campus crimes, other than forcible sex offenses
and murder, were lower in 2013 than in 2001. In the
case of forcible sex offenses, the rate increased from
1.9 per 10,000 students in 2001 to 3.3 in 2013. The

2013 and in 2001 (0.015).

In 2013, the number of crimes committed on college
campuses differed by type of institution, though to
some extent this reflects the enrollment size of the
types and the presence of student residence halls.
Crimes involving students on campus after normal
class hours, such as those occurring in residence halls,
are included in campus crime reports, while crimes
involving students off campus are not. In 2013, more
on-campus crimes overall were reported at institutions
with residence halls than at institutions without
residence halls (24.2 vs. 6.2 per 10,000 students; table
22.2). Rates for most types of crime were also higher
for institutions with residence halls. For example,
more burglaries were reported at institutions with
residence halls than at institutions without residence
halls (13.9 vs. 2.9 per 10,000 students), and more
forcible sex offenses were reported at institutions
with residence halls than at institutions without them
(4.6 vs. 0.5 per 10,000 students).

Although data for different types of institutions
are difficult to compare directly because of the
differing structures of student services and campus
arrangements, there were decreases in the numbers of
on-campus crimes at all types of institutions between
2006 and 2013. At public 4-year institutions, the
number of on-campus crimes decreased from a high
of 20,600 in 2006 to 13,200 in 2013, and the number
of on-campus crimes per 10,000 students decreased
from 35.5 to 19.6 during this period (tables 22.1 and
22.2). Similarly, at nonprofit 4-year institutions, the
number of crimes decreased from 16,900 in 2006
to 10,400 in 2013, and the number of crimes per
10,000 students decreased from 57.7 to 31.3. At public
2-year institutions, the number of crimes decreased
from 5,700 to 3,100 between 2006 and 2013, and
the number of crimes per 10,000 students decreased
from 15.4 to 8.0.

As part of the Clery Act, institutions are required to
report the number of arrests made on college campuses
for illegal weapons possession and drug and liquor
law violations. In contrast to the decreases in reported
on-campus crimes, the number of arrests on campuses
increased overall between 2001 and 2013. The total
number of arrests for illegal weapons possession
and drug and liquor law violations increased from
40,300 in 2001 to 54,300 in 2011, then decreased to
47,800 in 2013 (figure 22.2 and table 22.1). While
the number of arrests for weapons possession was
3  percent lower in 2013 than in 2001 (1,000 vs.
1,100), arrests for drug law violations increased by
70 percent during this period, from 11,900 in 2001
to 20,100 in 2013. There was also an increase in the
number of arrests for liquor law violations between
2001 and 2006 (from 27,400 to 34,900); however, the
number decreased between 2006 and 2013, with the
2013 figure (26,600) lower than in any year between
2001 and 2012. Between 2001 and 2013, the number
of arrests per 10,000 students for weapons possession
decreased from 0.9 to 0.7, while the number of arrests
per 10,000 students for drug law violations increased
from 10.2 to 13.4 (figure 22.2 and table 22.2). The
number of arrests per 10,000 students for liquor law
violations increased between 2001 and 2006 (from
23.5 to 26.2), but decreased between 2006 and 2013
(from 26.2 to 17.7).

Postsecondary Campus Safety and Security

There were some differences among institution
types in the patterns of on-campus arrests made for
illegal weapons possession and drug and liquor law
violations. At public 4-year institutions, the number
of on-campus arrests per 10,000 students was lower
in 2013 than in 2001 (57.4 vs. 60.1; table  22.2).
At nonprofit 4-year institutions, the number of
on-campus arrests per 10,000 students decreased
from 24.5 in 2001 to 17.2 in 2013. In contrast, the
number of on-campus arrests per 10,000 students at
public 2-year institutions was higher in 2013 than in
2001 (8.0 vs. 7.8).
In addition to reporting on-campus arrests,
institutions report referrals for disciplinary action
for cases involving illegal weapons possession, drug
law violations, and liquor law violations. Disciplinary
action counts only include incidents for which there
was a referral for institutional disciplinary action,
but no arrest. In 2013, there were 246,400 referrals
for disciplinary action for cases involving weapons,
drugs, and liquor law violations, with most of the
referrals (90 percent) involving violations in residence
halls (table 22.1). The largest number of disciplinary
referrals (190,900) involved liquor law violations.

Similar to the number of on-campus arrests for drug
law violations, the number of disciplinary referrals
for these incidents increased between 2001 and 2013
(from 23,900 to 54,100 for a 127 percent increase;
figure 22.3 and table 22.1). The number of referrals
for liquor law violations also increased from 130,000
in 2001 to 190,900 in 2013 (a 47 percent increase).
The number of referrals for illegal weapons possession
was lower in 2013 (1,400) than in 2006 (1,900), but it
was higher than the number of such referrals in 2001
(1,300). Some of these increases may be associated
with there being more students on college campuses.
The number of referrals per 10,000 students for illegal
weapons possession increased between 2001 and 2006
(from 1.1 to 1.4), but decreased between 2006 and
2013 (from 1.4 to 1.0; figure 22.3 and table  22.2).
The number of referrals per 10,000 students for drug
law violations was lower in 2006 than in 2001 (20.4
vs. 20.5 referrals); however, it increased between 2006
and 2013 (from 20.4 to 36.1 referrals). While the

number of referrals per 10,000 students for liquor law
violations increased between 2001 and 2006 (from
111.3 to 141.6), the number in 2013 was lower than
in 2006 (127.2 vs. 141.6 referrals).
Both public 4-year and nonprofit 4-year institutions
had increases in disciplinary referrals between 2001
and 2013. At public 4-year institutions, the number
of referrals for disciplinary action involving illegal
weapons possession, drug law violations, and liquor
law violations increased from 153.1 per 10,000
students in 2001 to 189.6 in 2013 (table 22.2). At
nonprofit 4-year institutions, the number of referrals
for these types of incidents rose from 275.5 per 10,000
students to 330.9. In both 2001 and 2013, liquor law
violations constituted the majority of these referrals
for disciplinary action at public 4-year (82 percent
in 2001 and 77 percent in 2013) and nonprofit
4-year (86 percent in 2001 and 79 percent in 2013)
institutions.

Indicator 23
Hate Crime Incidents at Postsecondary Institutions
In 2013, out of the 781 total hate crimes reported on college campuses, the most common type of hate crime
reported by postsecondary institutions was destruction, damage, and vandalism (364 incidents), followed
by intimidation (295 incidents) and simple assault (89 incidents). Race and sexual orientation were the
categories of motivating bias most frequently associated with hate crimes.
A 2008 amendment to the Jeanne Clery Disclosure
of Campus Security and Campus Crime Statistics Act
(see Criminal Incidents at Postsecondary Institutions;
Indicator 22) requires campuses to report hate crime
incidents. A hate crime is a criminal offense that is
motivated, in whole or in part, by the perpetrator’s
bias against the victim(s) based on their race,
ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or
disability. Individual institutions are provided
guidance on classifying hate crimes in the Handbook
for Campus Safety and Security Reporting, but
the final classifications are at the discretion of the
institution. In addition to reporting data on haterelated incidents for the existing seven types of crimes
(criminal homicide, including murder and negligent
manslaughter; sex offenses, forcible and nonforcible;
robbery; aggravated assault; burglary; motor vehicle
theft; and arson), the 2008 amendment to the Clery
Act required campuses to report hate-related incidents
on four additional types of crimes: simple assault;
larceny; intimidation; and destruction, damage, and
vandalism.
In 2013, there were 781 criminal incidents classified
as hate crimes that occurred on the campuses of
public and private 2-year and 4-year postsecondary
institutions which were reported to police and
security agencies (table 23.1). The most common type
of hate crime reported by institutions was destruction,
damage, and vandalism (364 incidents; hereafter
referred to as “vandalism” in this indicator), followed
by intimidation (295 incidents), simple assault
(89 incidents), larceny (15 incidents), forcible sex
offenses (7 incidents), aggravated assault (6 incidents),
burglary (4 incidents), and robbery (1 incident; figure
23.1). For several other types of on-campus crimes—
namely, murder, negligent manslaughter, nonforcible
sex offenses, motor vehicle theft, and arson—there
were no incidents classified as hate crimes in 2013.

The distribution of on-campus crimes classified as
hate crimes in 2013 was similar to the distributions
in previous years. Vandalism, intimidation, and
simple assault constituted the three most common
types of hate crimes reported by institutions in
every year from 2009 to 2012. For example, of the
787 criminal incidents classified as hate crimes in
2012, there were 403 vandalisms, 268 intimidations,
and 79 simple assaults. Also similar to 2013, there
were no reported incidents of murder, negligent
manslaughter, nonforcible sex offenses, or motor
vehicle theft classified as hate crimes in any year from
2009 to 2012.
For the three most common types of hate crimes
reported in 2013 (vandalism, intimidation, and
simple assault), the most frequent category of
motivating bias associated with these crimes was race.
Race-related hate crimes accounted for 41 percent
of reported vandalisms classified as hate crimes
(151 incidents), 37 percent of reported intimidations
(110 incidents), and 38 percent of reported simple
assaults (34  incidents; figure 23.2 and table 23.1). The
second most frequent category of bias associated with
all three types of crimes was sexual orientation. Thirtyone percent of vandalism hate crimes (112  incidents),
23  percent of intimidations (69 incidents), and
29 percent of simple assaults (26  incidents) were
classified with sexual orientation as the motivating
bias. Among the other categories of bias, 13 percent
of vandalism hate crimes were associated with
religion (48  incidents), 10 percent with ethnicity
(37 incidents), 4 percent with gender (14 incidents),
and 1 percent with disability (2  incidents). For
intimidation hate crimes, 17  percent were associated
with ethnicity (49 incidents), 13  percent with gender
(37 incidents), 8 percent with religion (24 incidents),
and 2 percent with disability (6 incidents).

For simple assaults classified as hate crimes, 19 percent
were associated with gender (17 incidents), 8 percent
with ethnicity (7 incidents), and 6 percent with
religion (5 incidents). No simple assaults were
associated with disability.
Similar to 2013, race and sexual orientation were
the categories of bias most frequently associated
with the three most common hate crimes in 2012:
46 percent of vandalisms (186 incidents), 45 percent
of intimidations (120 incidents), and 46 percent
of simple assaults (36 incidents) were associated
with race; in addition, 26 percent of vandalisms
and intimidations (104 incidents and 70 incidents,
respectively) and 27 percent of simple assaults
(21 incidents) were associated with sexual orientation
(table 23.1).

Postsecondary Campus Safety and Security

Larceny was the fourth most commonly reported
hate crime in 2013. Five of the 15 larceny hate crimes
reported in 2013 were associated with race, followed
by sexual orientation and religion (3 incidents each)
and ethnicity and gender (2 incidents each). No
larceny hate crimes were associated with disability.
While the number of hate crimes reported in 2013
was highest at 4-year private nonprofit and 4-year
public postsecondary institutions (349 and 295 total
incidents, respectively), these institutions also enroll
the largest numbers of students. Public 2-year
institutions, which also enroll a large number of
students, had the third highest number of reported
hate crimes (106 incidents). The frequency of crimes
and the most commonly reported categories of bias
were similar across these types of postsecondary
institutions.

4A school belonging scale was constructed based on the extent to which students agreed or disagreed that they felt safe at school,
that they felt proud of being part of the school, that there were always teachers or other adults at school they could talk to if they had
a problem, that school was often a waste of time, and that getting good grades was important to them. Students’ sense of school
belonging is considered low if they were in the bottom quarter of the scale distribution, middle if they were in the middle two quarters, and high if they were in the highest quarter.
NOTE: Estimates weighted by W2W1PAR. Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Detail may not sum to totals

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent.
‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent
or greater.
1The total includes all students whose parents provided a response about their child’s suspension and expulsion status both on the
base-year (2009) questionnaire and on the first follow-up (2012) questionnaire.
2Socioeconomic status (SES) was measured by a composite score on parental education and occupations, and family income.
3A school engagement scale was constructed based on students’ responses to questions about how frequently they went to class
without homework done, without pencil or paper, without books, or late. Students’ school engagement is considered low if they were in
the bottom quarter of the scale distribution, middle if they were in the middle two quarters, and high if they were in the highest quarter.

1For 2006 and later years, includes the “Two or more races” category, which did not appear on
earlier questionnaires. For 2003 and earlier years, includes an “Other” category. Respondents
who selected “Other” were instructed to specify what this meant. Examination of these written-in
responses, which account for less than 1 percent of the records, indicates that the majority refer to
individuals of mixed racial/ethnic identity.
2Delinquent/criminal offenses range from those committed against persons (e.g., assault) to technical violations, which include violations of probation, parole, or valid court orders. A “status”
offense is illegal for underage persons, but not for adults (e.g., truancy or underage drinking).
3Private facilities are operated by private nonprofit or for-profit corporations or organizations.
4Although respondents may select more than one type for their facility, this table assigns each
facility to a single primary type based on an analysis that applies a hierarchy rule. For 1997, the
facility type data exclude 327 juveniles who were in facilities identified only as “Other.”

2013

5Prior

to 2003, residential treatment centers were included in the “Group home” category.
NOTE: Data are from a biennial survey of all secure and nonsecure residential placement facilities
that house juvenile offenders, defined as persons younger than 21 who are held in a residential
setting as a result of some contact with the justice system (they are charged with or adjudicated
for an offense). Data do not include adult prisons, jails, federal facilities, or facilities exclusively for
drug or mental health treatment or for abused or neglected youth. The data provide 1-day population counts of juveniles in residential placement facilities; 1-day counts differ substantially from the
annual admission and release data used to measure facility population flow. For definitions of specific terms, see http://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/ezacjrp/asp/glossary.asp.

1For 2006 and later years, includes the “Two or more races” category, which did not appear on
earlier questionnaires. For 2003 and earlier years, includes an “Other” category. Respondents
who selected “Other” were instructed to specify what this meant. Examination of these writtenin responses, which account for less than 1 percent of the records, indicates that the majority
refer to individuals of mixed racial/ethnic identity.
NOTE: Residential placement rate calculated per 100,000 persons age 10 through the upper
age at which those charged with a criminal law violation were under original jurisdiction of the
juvenile courts in each state in the given year (through age 17 in most states); for more information, see http://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/structure_process/qa04101.asp?qaDate=2013. Data are

from a biennial survey of all secure and nonsecure residential placement facilities that house
juvenile offenders, defined as persons younger than 21 who are held in a residential setting as
a result of some contact with the justice system (they are charged with or adjudicated for an
offense). Data do not include adult prisons, jails, federal facilities, or facilities exclusively for drug
or mental health treatment or for abused or neglected youth. The data provide 1-day population
counts of juveniles in residential placement facilities; 1-day counts differ substantially from the
annual admission and release data used to measure facility population flow.

school-associated violent death is defined as “a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention
(involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a
functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States,” while the victim was on
the way to or from regular sessions at school, or while the victim was attending or traveling
to or from an official school-sponsored event.
2“At school” includes on school property, on the way to or from regular sessions at school,
and while attending or traveling to or from a school-sponsored event.
3Total youth suicides are reported for calendar years 1992 through 2012 (instead of school
years 1992–93 through 2012–13).
4Data from 1999–2000 onward are subject to change until interviews with school and law
enforcement officials have been completed. The details learned during the interviews can
occasionally change the classification of a case.

NOTE: Unless otherwise noted, data are reported for the school year, defined as July 1
through June 30. Some data have been revised from previously published figures.

and violent crimes. Data in this table are from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS); due to differences in time coverage and administration between the NCVS and the School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the NCVS, data in this table cannot be
compared with data in tables that are based on the SCS. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30
and 50 percent.
‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the
coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indians/
Alaska Natives, Asians (prior to 2005), Pacific Islanders, and, from 2003 onward, persons of
Two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity
across years should be made with caution.

violent victimization is also included in violent victimization.
NOTE: “Total victimization” includes theft and violent victimization. A single student could
report more than one type of victimization. In the total victimization section, students who
reported both theft and violent victimization are counted only once. “Theft” includes
attempted and completed purse-snatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and
completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery,
which involves the threat or use of force and is classified as a violent crime. “Serious violent
victimization” includes the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.
“Violent victimization” includes the serious violent crimes as well as simple assault. “At
school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001
onward, going to and from school.

1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students could not be classified
as Two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing data on race
from 1993, 1995, and 1997 with data from later years.
NOTE: Survey respondents were asked about being threatened or injured “with a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club on school
property.” “On school property” was not defined for respondents. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

1Data for the U.S. total include both public and private schools and were collected through a
national survey representing the entire country.
2Data include both public and private schools.
NOTE: Survey respondents were asked about being threatened or injured “with a weapon
such as a gun, knife, or club on school property.” “On school property” was not defined for
respondents. State-level data include public schools only, with the exception of data for Ohio
and South Dakota. Data for the U.S. total, Ohio, and South Dakota include both public and

private schools. For specific states, a given year’s data may be unavailable (1) because the
state did not participate in the survey that year; (2) because the state omitted this particular
survey item from the state-level questionnaire; or (3) because the state had an overall
response rate of less than 60 percent (the overall response rate is the school response rate
multiplied by the student response rate).

NOTE: Teachers who taught only prekindergarten students are excluded. Instructional level divides teachers into elementary or
secondary based on a combination of the grades taught, main teaching assignment, and the structure of the teachers’ class(es).
Please see the glossary for a more detailed definition. Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Please see the
glossary for a more detailed definition. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Some data have been revised from
previously published figures.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent.
1Teachers were classified as elementary or secondary on the basis of the grades they taught, rather than on the level of the
school in which they taught. In general, elementary teachers include those teaching prekindergarten through grade 5 and those
teaching multiple grades, with a preponderance of grades taught being kindergarten through grade 6. In general, secondary
teachers include those teaching any of grades 7 through 12 and those teaching multiple grades, with a preponderance of grades
taught being grades 7 through 12 and usually with no grade taught being lower than grade 5.
2Includes American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asians, and Pacific Islanders; for 2003–04 and later years, also includes persons of
Two or more races.
3Includes traditional public and public charter schools.

should be used when making direct comparisons of “Other incidents” between years because the survey questions about alcohol and drugs changed, as outlined in footnotes 6, 7, and 8.
survey items “Distribution of illegal drugs” and “Possession or use of alcohol or illegal drugs” appear only on the 1999–2000 and
2003–04 questionnaires. Different alcohol- and drug-related survey items were used on the questionnaires for later years.
7The survey items “Distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs” and “Distribution, possession, or use of alcohol” appear only on the
questionnaires for 2005–06 and later years.
8The 2009–10 questionnaire was the first to include the survey item “Inappropriate distribution, possession, or use of prescription drugs.”
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At
school” was defined to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold
school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, and after normal
school hours or when school activities or events were in session. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and because schools
that recorded or reported more than one type of crime incident were counted only once in the total percentage of schools recording or
reporting incidents.

‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1Data for 2013–14 were collected using the Fast Response Survey System, while data for earlier years were collected using the School
Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS). The 2013–14 survey was designed to allow comparisons with SSOCS data. However, respondents to the 2013–14 survey could choose either to complete the survey on paper (and mail it back) or to complete the survey online,
whereas respondents to SSOCS did not have the option of completing the survey online. The 2013–14 survey also relied on a smaller
sample. The smaller sample size and change in survey administration may have impacted 2013–14 results.
2Because the 2013–14 survey did not collect school enrollment counts, the rate per 1,000 students was calculated by dividing the number
of incidents by the total number of students obtained from the Common Core of Data.
3Total not presented for 2013–14 because the survey did not collect information regarding theft and other incidents. Therefore, the total
incident rate is not comparable with earlier years.
4Theft/larceny (taking things worth over $10 without personal confrontation) was defined for respondents as “the unlawful taking of another
person’s property without personal confrontation, threat, violence, or bodily harm.” This includes pocket picking, stealing a purse or backpack (if left unattended or no force was used to take it from owner), theft from a building, theft from a motor vehicle or motor vehicle parts
or accessories, theft of a bicycle, theft from a vending machine, and all other types of thefts.

dents obtained from the Common Core of Data (CCD). For 2013–14, the classification of schools by the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch was also computed from CCD data.
5Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher
than grade 8. Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not
higher than grade 9. High schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest grade
is not higher than grade 12. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades, including K–12 schools. Separate data on
high schools and combined schools are not available for 2013–14.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school.
“At school” was defined to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that
hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after
normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent.
‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent
or greater.
1Data for 2013–14 were collected using the Fast Response Survey System, while data for 2009–10 were collected using the School
Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS). The 2013–14 survey was designed to allow comparisons with SSOCS data. However,
respondents to the 2013–14 survey could choose either to complete the survey on paper (and mail it back) or to complete the survey online, whereas respondents to SSOCS did not have the option of completing the survey online. The 2013–14 survey also
relied on a smaller sample. The smaller sample size and change in survey administration may have impacted 2013–14 results.
2All violent incidents include serious violent incidents (see footnote 3) as well as physical attack or fight without a weapon and threat
of physical attack without a weapon.
3Serious violent incidents include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon, threat of physical
attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon.
4The 2013–14 survey collected neither school enrollment counts nor data on the percentage of students eligible for free or reducedprice lunch. For 2013–14, the rate per 1,000 students was calculated by dividing the number of incidents by the total number of stu-

not higher than grade 9. High schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest
grade is not higher than grade 12. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades, including K–12 schools.
6Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of fulltime-equivalent (FTE) teachers. Information regarding the total number of FTE teachers was obtained from the Common Core of
Data (CCD), the sampling frame for SSOCS.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school.
“At school” was defined to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places
that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or
after normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

1Includes schools that reported the activity happens either at least once a week or daily.
2Includes schools that reported the activity happens at all at their school during the school year. In the 1999–2000 survey
administration, the questionnaire specified “undesirable” gang activities and “undesirable” cult or extremist group activities.
3Prior to the 2007–08 survey administration, the questionnaire wording was “student racial tensions.”
4Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not
higher than grade 8. Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. High schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9
and the highest grade is not higher than grade 12. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades, including
K–12 schools. Separate data on high schools and combined schools are not available for 2013–14.
5Data for 2013–14 were collected using the Fast Response Survey System, while data for earlier years were collected using
the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS). The 2013–14 survey was designed to allow comparisons with SSOCS

data. However, respondents to the 2013–14 survey could choose either to complete the survey on paper (and mail it back) or
to complete the survey online, whereas respondents to SSOCS did not have the option of completing the survey online. The
2013–14 survey also relied on a smaller sample. The smaller sample size and change in survey administration may have
impacted 2013–14 results.
6Because the 2013–14 survey did not collect data on the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, the
classification of schools by the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch was computed based on data
obtained from the Common Core of Data.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the
school. “At school” was defined to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and
at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to respond only for those times that
were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified otherwise.

1Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and
the highest grade is not higher than grade 8. Middle schools are defined as schools in which the
lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. High
schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 12. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades,
including K–12 schools.
2Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the
school by the total number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers. Information regarding the total
number of FTE teachers was obtained from the Common Core of Data (CCD), the sampling
frame for SSOCS.

3“Violent incidents” include rape or attempted rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack
or fight with or without a weapon, threat of physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, and
robbery with or without a weapon. “At school” was defined for respondents to include activities
that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold
school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to respond only for those
times that were during normal school hours or when school activities and events were in session.
NOTE: Includes schools reporting that cyber-bullying happens either “daily” or “at least once a
week.” “Cyber-bullying” was defined for respondents as occurring “when willful and repeated harm
is inflicted through the use of computers, cell phones, or other electronic devices.” Responses
were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues
at the school. Respondents were instructed to include cyber-bullying “problems that can occur
anywhere (both at your school and away from school).”

in 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period was the previous
6 months. Cognitive testing showed that estimates from 2007 onward are comparable to previous years.
NOTE: Urbanicity refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in
2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).” All gangs, whether or not they are involved in violent or illegal activity, are included. “At school”
includes in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and going to and from school.

1Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.
2Before 1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students were not given the option of
choosing two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing data on race
from 1993, 1995, and 1997 with data from later years.

1Starting in 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period was the previous 6
months. Cognitive testing showed that estimates from 2007 onward are comparable to previous years.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asians (prior to 2005),
Pacific Islanders, and, from 2003 onward, persons of Two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of
race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between
30 and 50 percent.
‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the
coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1Students who indicated that they had been called a hate-related word were asked to
choose the specific characteristics that the hate-related word or words targeted. Students
were allowed to choose more than one characteristic. If a student chose more than one
characteristic, he or she is counted only once in the total percentage of students who
reported being called a hate-related word; therefore, the total is less than the sum of the
students’ individual characteristics.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indians/

Alaska Natives, Pacific Islanders, and persons of Two or more races.
3Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s
household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city
of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” “and not MSA (Rural).”
NOTE: “At school” includes in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or
going to and from school. “Hate-related” refers to derogatory terms used by others in reference to students’ personal characteristics. Detail may not sum to totals because of
rounding and because students may have reported being targets of hate-related words
related to more than one student characteristic.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30
and 50 percent.
‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the
coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indians/
Alaska Natives, Pacific Islanders, and persons of Two or more races.
2Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an
MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).” These data
by metropolitan status were based on the location of households and differ from those published in Student Reports of Bullying and Cyber-Bullying: Results from the 2011 School

Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, which were based on the
urban-centric measure of the location of the school that the child attended.
3Control of school as reported by the respondent. These data differ from those based on a
matching of the respondent-reported school name to the Common Core of Data’s Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey or the Private School Survey, as reported in
Student Reports of Bullying and Cyber-Bullying: Results from the 2011 School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey.
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going
to and from school. Bullying types do not sum to totals because students could have experienced more than one type of bullying.

1Bullying was defined for respondents as “when one or more students tease, threaten, spread
rumors about, hit, shove, or hurt another student over and over again.” “On school property”
was not defined for survey respondents.
2Survey respondents were asked about being electronically bullied (“being bullied through email, chat rooms, instant messaging, websites, or texting”). Data on electronic bullying were
not collected in 2009.
3Data for the U.S. total include both public and private schools and were collected through a
national survey representing the entire country.
4Data include both public and private schools.

NOTE: State-level data include public schools only, with the exception of data for Ohio and
South Dakota. Data for the U.S. total, Ohio, and South Dakota include both public and private
schools. For specific states, a given year’s data may be unavailable (1) because the state did
not participate in the survey that year; (2) because the state omitted this particular survey
item from the state-level questionnaire; or (3) because the state had an overall response rate
of less than 60 percent (the overall response rate is the school response rate multiplied by the
student response rate).

are not possible.
NOTE: Teachers who taught only prekindergarten students are excluded. Includes both teachers who “strongly” agreed and
those who “somewhat” agreed that student misbehavior or student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching.

‡Reporting standards not met. Data may be suppressed because the response rate is under 50 percent, there are too few cases
for a reliable estimate, or the coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1Respondents were asked whether “rules for student behavior are consistently enforced by teachers in this school, even for students not in their classes.”
2Respondents were asked whether their “principal enforces school rules for student conduct and backs me up when I need it.”
3Elementary schools are those with any of grades kindergarten through grade 6 and none of grades 9 through 12. Secondary
schools have any of grades 7 through 12 and none of grades kindergarten through grade 6. Combined elementary/secondary
schools are included in totals but are not shown separately.

improvements in geocoding technology and changes in the Office of Management and Budget’s definition of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas allow for more precision in describing an area as of 2003–04. Comparisons with earlier years
are not possible.
NOTE: Teachers who taught only prekindergarten students are excluded. Includes both teachers who “strongly” agreed and
those who “somewhat” agreed that rules were enforced by other teachers and the principal. Some data have been revised from
previously published figures.

‡Reporting standards not met. Data may be suppressed because the response rate is
under 50 percent, there are too few cases for a reliable estimate, or the coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1Respondents were asked whether “rules for student behavior are consistently enforced by
teachers in this school, even for students not in their classes.”
2Respondents were asked whether their “principal enforces school rules for student conduct

and backs me up when I need it.”
NOTE: Teachers who taught only prekindergarten students are excluded. Includes traditional public and public charter school teachers. Includes both teachers who “strongly”
agreed and those who “somewhat” agreed.

3Before 1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students could not be classified as
Two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing data on race from 1993,
1995, and 1997 with data from later years.
4Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
5In the question asking students about physical fights at school, “on school property” was not defined for survey respondents.

1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many times in the past 12 months they had been in a physical fight.
2In the question asking students about physical fights at school, “on school property” was not
defined for survey respondents.
3Data for the U.S. total include both public and private schools and were collected through a
national survey representing the entire country.
4Data include both public and private schools.

NOTE: State-level data include public schools only, with the exception of data for Ohio and South
Dakota. Data for the U.S. total, Ohio, and South Dakota include both public and private schools.
For specific states, a given year’s data may be unavailable (1) because the state did not participate in the survey that year; (2) because the state omitted this particular survey item from the
state-level questionnaire; or (3) because the state had an overall response rate of less than 60
percent (the overall response rate is the school response rate multiplied by the student response
rate).

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent.
1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many
days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.
3Before 1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students could not be classified as
Two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing data on race from 1993,
1995, and 1997 with data from later years.

1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire;
students were simply asked how many days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days.
2In the question asking students about carrying a weapon at school, “on school property” was
not defined for survey respondents.
3Data for the U.S. total include both public and private schools and were collected through a
national survey representing the entire country.
4Data include both public and private schools.
NOTE: Respondents were asked about carrying “a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club.”
State-level data include public schools only, with the exception of data for Ohio and South

Dakota. Data for the U.S. total, Ohio, and South Dakota include both public and private
schools. For specific states, a given year’s data may be unavailable (1) because the state did
not participate in the survey that year; (2) because the state omitted this particular survey
item from the state-level questionnaire; or (3) because the state had an overall response rate
of less than 60 percent (the overall response rate is the school response rate multiplied by the
student response rate).

‡Reporting standards not met. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is 50 percent or greater.
1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how
many days during the previous 30 days they had at least one drink of alcohol.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.
3Before 1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students could not be classified
as Two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing data on race
from 1993, 1995, and 1997 with data from later years.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30
and 50 percent.
‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the
coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire;
students were simply asked how many days during the previous 30 days they had at least
one drink of alcohol.

2In the question about drinking alcohol at school, “on school property” was not defined for
survey respondents.
3Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.
4Data on alcohol use at school were not collected in 2013.
NOTE: Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between
30 and 50 percent.
1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many days during the previous 30 days they had
at least one drink of alcohol.
2In the question about drinking alcohol at school, “on school property” was not defined for
survey respondents. Data on alcohol use at school were not collected in 2013.
3Data for the U.S. total include both public and private schools and were collected
through a national survey representing the entire country.

include both public and private schools.
NOTE: State-level data include public schools only, with the exception of data for Ohio
and South Dakota. Data for the U.S. total, Ohio, and South Dakota include both public
and private schools. For specific states, a given year’s data may be unavailable (1)
because the state did not participate in the survey that year; (2) because the state omitted this particular survey item from the state-level questionnaire; or (3) because the state
had an overall response rate of less than 60 percent (the overall response rate is the
school response rate multiplied by the student response rate).

3Before 1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students could not be classified as
Two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing data on race from 1993,
1995, and 1997 with data from later years.
4Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
5In the question about using marijuana at school, “on school property” was not defined for survey respondents. Data on marijuana use
at school were not collected in 2013.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between
30 and 50 percent.
1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many times during the previous 30 days they had
used marijuana.
2In the question about using marijuana at school, “on school property” was not defined for
survey respondents. Data on marijuana use at school were not collected in 2013.
3Data for the U.S. total include both public and private schools and were collected
through a national survey representing the entire country.

NOTE: State-level data include public schools only, with the exception of data for Ohio
and South Dakota. Data for the U.S. total, Ohio, and South Dakota include both public
and private schools. For specific states, a given year’s data may be unavailable (1)
because the state did not participate in the survey that year; (2) because the state omitted this particular survey item from the state-level questionnaire; or (3) because the state
had an overall response rate of less than 60 percent (the overall response rate is the
school response rate multiplied by the student response rate).

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30
and 50 percent.
‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the
coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1Starting in 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the
reference period was the previous 6 months. Cognitive testing showed that estimates from
2007 onward are comparable to previous years.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indians/
Alaska Natives, Asians (prior to 2005), Pacific Islanders, and, from 2003 onward, persons of
Two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity
across years should be made with caution.

3Refers

to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an
MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and,
from 2001 onward, going to and from school. Students were asked if they “never,” “almost
never,” “sometimes,” or “most of the time” feared that someone would attack or harm them at
school or away from school. Students responding “sometimes” or “most of the time” were
considered fearful. For the 2001 survey only, the wording was changed from “attack or harm”
to “attack or threaten to attack.”

to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an
MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
4Before 2007, students were asked whether they avoided “any extracurricular activities.”
Starting in 2007, the survey wording was changed to “any activities.”
NOTE: Students were asked whether they avoided places or activities because they thought
that someone might attack or harm them. For the 2001 survey only, the wording was changed
from “attack or harm” to “attack or threaten to attack.” Detail may not sum to totals because of
rounding and because students reporting more than one type of avoidance were counted
only once in the totals.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30
and 50 percent.
‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the
coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1Starting in 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the
reference period was the previous 6 months. Cognitive testing showed that estimates from
2007 onward are comparable to previous years.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indians/
Alaska Natives, Asians (prior to 2005), Pacific Islanders, and, from 2003 onward, persons of
Two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity
across years should be made with caution.

1Corporal punishment is paddling, spanking, or other forms of physical punishment
imposed on a student.
2An in-school suspension is an instance in which a student is temporarily removed from his
or her regular classroom(s) for at least half a day but remains under the direct supervision
of school personnel.
3For students without disabilities and students with disabilities served only under Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act, out-of-school suspensions are instances in which a student is
excluded from school for disciplinary reasons for 1 school day or longer. This does not
include students who served their suspension in the school. For students with disabilities
served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), out-of-school suspensions are instances in which a student is temporarily removed from his or her regular
school for disciplinary purposes to another setting (e.g., home, behavior center). This
includes both removals in which no Individualized Education Program (IEP) services are
provided because the removal is 10 days or less and removals in which IEP services continue to be provided.
4Expulsions are actions taken by a local education agency that result in the removal of a
student from his or her regular school for disciplinary purposes for the remainder of the
school year or longer in accordance with local education agency policy. Expulsions also
include removals resulting from violations of the Gun Free Schools Act that are modified to
less than 365 days.
5Referral to law enforcement is an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school

grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of
whether official action is taken.
6A school-related arrest is an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school
grounds, during off-campus school activities (including while taking school transportation),
or due to a referral by any school official.
7Totals include expulsions with and without educational services.
8Includes all expulsions under zero-tolerance policies, including expulsions with and without educational services. A zero-tolerance policy results in mandatory expulsion of any student who commits one or more specified offenses (for example, offenses involving guns,
other weapons, violence, or similar factors, or combinations of these factors). A policy is
considered zero tolerance even if there are some exceptions to the mandatory aspect of
the expulsion, such as allowing the chief administering officer of a local education agency
to modify the expulsion on a case-by-case basis.
9Data by race/ethnicity exclude data for students with disabilities served only under Section
504 (not receiving services under IDEA).
NOTE: Student counts between 1 and 3 are displayed as 1-3 to protect student privacy.
Detail may not sum to totals because of privacy protection routines applied to the data.
Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.

NOTE: The percentage of students receiving a disciplinary action is calculated by dividing
the cumulative number of students receiving that type of disciplinary action for the entire
2011–12 school year by the student enrollment based on a count of students taken on a
single day between September 27 and December 31. Race categories exclude persons of
Hispanic ethnicity.

‡Reporting standards not met (too few cases).
1For students without disabilities and students with disabilities served only under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, out-ofschool suspensions are instances in which a student is excluded from school for disciplinary reasons for 1 school day or longer.
This does not include students who served their suspension in the school. For students with disabilities served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), out-of-school suspensions are instances in which a student is temporarily removed
from his or her regular school for disciplinary purposes to another setting (e.g., home, behavior center). This includes both
removals in which no Individualized Education Program (IEP) services are provided because the removal is 10 days or less and
removals in which IEP services continue to be provided.

2Expulsions are actions taken by a local education agency that result in the removal of a student from his or her regular school
for disciplinary purposes, with or without the continuation of educational services, for the remainder of the school year or longer
in accordance with local education agency policy. Expulsions also include removals resulting from violations of the Gun Free
Schools Act that are modified to less than 365 days.
3Data by race/ethnicity exclude students with disabilities served only under Section 504 (not receiving services under IDEA).
NOTE: The percentage of students receiving a disciplinary action is calculated by dividing the cumulative number of students
receiving that type of disciplinary action for the entire 2011–12 school year by the student enrollment based on a count of students taken on a single day between September 27 and December 31. Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.

1Data for 2013–14 were collected using the Fast Response Survey System, while data for earlier years were collected using the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS). The 2013–14
survey was designed to allow comparisons with SSOCS data. However, respondents to the
2013–14 survey could choose either to complete the survey on paper (and mail it back) or to
complete the survey online, whereas respondents to SSOCS did not have the option of completing the survey online. The 2013–14 survey also relied on a smaller sample. The smaller
sample size and change in survey administration may have impacted 2013–14 results.

not higher than grade 9. High schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest
grade is not higher than grade 12. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades, including K–12 schools. Separate
data on high schools and combined schools are not available.
6The classification of schools by the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch was computed based on data
obtained from the Common Core of Data.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the
school. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

1“Security guards” and “security personnel” do not include law enforcement. School Resource Officers include all career law enforcement officers with arrest authority who have specialized training and are assigned to work in collaboration with school organizations.
2Data for 2013–14 were collected using the Fast Response Survey System, while data for earlier years were collected using the
School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS). The 2013–14 survey was designed to allow comparisons with SSOCS data. However, respondents to the 2013–14 survey could choose either to complete the survey on paper (and mail it back) or to complete the
survey online, whereas respondents to SSOCS did not have the option of completing the survey online. The 2013–14 survey also
relied on a smaller sample. The smaller sample size and change in survey administration may have impacted 2013–14 results.

higher than grade 9. High schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest grade
is not higher than grade 12. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades, including K–12 schools. Separate data on
high schools and combined schools are not available for 2013–14.
4For 2013–14, the questionnaire did not include a question about the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch,
so the classification of schools by the percentage of eligible students was computed based on data obtained from the Common
Core of Data.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school.
Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

1Schools were not asked whether they had drilled students on the use of a plan for suicide threat or incident, severe risk of terrorist
attack, and pandemic flu.
2For example, earthquakes or tornadoes.
3For example, release of mustard gas, anthrax, smallpox, or radioactive materials.
4In 2007–08 and 2009–10, schools were asked whether they had a plan for procedures to be performed if the U.S. national threat
level were changed to Red (Severe Risk of Terrorist Attack) by the Department of Homeland Security. In 2013–14, schools were
asked whether they had a plan for procedures to be performed if an “imminent threat alert” were issued by the Department of
Homeland Security's National Terrorism Advisory System.
5Data on suicide threat or incident, severe risk of terrorist attack, and pandemic flu were not collected in 2003–04 and 2005–06.
6Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher

is not higher than grade 12. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades, including K–12 schools. Separate data on
high schools and combined schools are not available for 2013–14.
7Data for 2013–14 were collected using the Fast Response Survey System, while data for earlier years were collected using the
School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS). The 2013–14 survey was designed to allow comparisons with SSOCS data. However, respondents to the 2013–14 survey could choose either to complete the survey on paper (and mail it back) or to complete the
survey online, whereas respondents to SSOCS did not have the option of completing the survey online. The 2013–14 survey also
relied on a smaller sample. The smaller sample size and change in survey administration may have impacted 2013–14 results.
8Because the 2013–14 survey did not collect data on the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, the classification of schools by the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch was computed based on data obtained from
the Common Core of Data.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school.

General Information
The indicators in this report are based on information
drawn from a variety of independent data sources,
including national surveys of students, teachers,
principals, and postsecondary institutions, and data
collection from federal departments and agencies,
including the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the National
Center for Education Statistics, the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the Office of Postsecondary Education,
the Office for Civil Rights, and the Office of
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Each
data source has an independent sample design, data
collection method, and questionnaire design or is
the result of a universe data collection. Universe data
collections include a census of all known entities
in a specific universe (e.g., all deaths occurring on
school property). Readers should be cautious when
comparing data from different sources. Differences in
sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and
question phrasing can all affect the comparability of
results. For example, some questions from different
surveys may appear the same, but were asked of
different populations of students (e.g., students ages
12–18 or students in grades 9–12); in different years;
about experiences that occurred within different
periods of time (e.g., in the past 30 days or during
the past 12 months); or at different locations (e.g., in
school or anywhere).
Findings described in this report with comparative
language (e.g., higher, lower, increase, and decrease)
are statistically significant at the .05 level. The primary
test procedure used in this report was Student’s t
statistic, which tests the difference between two
sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted
for multiple comparisons. Estimates displayed in the
text, figures, and tables are rounded from original
estimates, not from a series of rounding.
The following is a description of data sources,
accuracy of estimates, and statistical procedures used
in this report.

School-Associated Violent Deaths Study (SAVD)
The School-Associated Violent Deaths Study (SAVD)
is an epidemiological study developed by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in conjunction
with the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S.
Department of Justice. SAVD seeks to describe the
epidemiology of school-associated violent deaths,
identify common features of these deaths, estimate
the rate of school-associated violent deaths in the
United States, and identify potential risk factors
for these deaths. The study includes descriptive
data on all school-associated violent deaths in the
United States, including all homicides, suicides, or
legal intervention deaths in which the fatal injury
occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary
or secondary school; while the victim was on the way
to or from regular sessions at such a school; or while
attending or on the way to or from an official schoolsponsored event. Victims of such incidents include
nonstudents, as well as students and staff members.
SAVD includes descriptive information about the
school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). The SAVD
study has collected data from July 1, 1992, through
the present.
SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and collect
data on school-associated violent deaths. Cases are
initially identified through a search of the LexisNexis
newspaper and media database. Then law enforcement
officials from the office that investigated the deaths
are contacted to confirm the details of the case and to
determine if the event meets the case definition. Once
a case is confirmed, a law enforcement official and a
school official are interviewed regarding details about
the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). A copy of
the full law enforcement report is also sought for each
case. The information obtained on schools includes
school demographics, attendance/absentee rates,
suspensions/expulsions and mobility, school history
of weapon-carrying incidents, security measures,
violence prevention activities, school response to the
event, and school policies about weapon carrying.
Event information includes the location of injury,
the context of injury (while classes were being held,
during break, etc.), motives for injury, method of
injury, and school and community events happening
around the time period. Information obtained on
victim(s) and offender(s) includes demographics,
circumstances of the event (date/time, alcohol or drug
use, number of persons involved), types and origins of
weapons, criminal history, psychological risk factors,
school-related problems, extracurricular activities,
and family history, including structure and stressors.

One hundred and five school-associated violent deaths
were identified from July 1, 1992, to June 30, 1994
(Kachur et al. 1996). A more recent report from
this data collection identified 253 school-associated
violent deaths between July 1, 1994, and June 30,
1999 (Anderson et al. 2001). Other publications from
this study have described how the number of events
change during the school year (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention 2001), the source of the
firearms used in these events (Reza et al. 2003), and
suicides that were associated with schools (Kauffman
et al. 2004). The most recent publication describes
trends in school-associated homicide from July 1,
1992, to June 30, 2006 (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention 2008). The interviews conducted
on cases between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1999,
achieved a response rate of 97 percent for police
officials and 78 percent for school officials. For several
reasons, all data for years from 1999 to the present
are flagged as preliminary. For some recent data, the
interviews with school and law enforcement officials
to verify case details have not been completed. The
details learned during the interviews can occasionally
change the classification of a case. Also, new cases
may be identified because of the expansion of the
scope of the media files used for case identification.
Sometimes other cases not identified during earlier
data years using the independent case finding efforts
(which focus on nonmedia sources of information)
will be discovered. Also, other cases may occasionally
be identified while the law enforcement and school
interviews are being conducted to verify known cases.

Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR)
Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) are a part
of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). These
reports provide incident-level information on criminal
homicides, including situation type (e.g., number of
victims, number of offenders, and whether offenders
are known); the age, sex, and race of victims and
offenders; weapon used; circumstances of the
incident; and the relationship of the victim to the
offender. The data are provided monthly to the FBI
by local law enforcement agencies participating in

the UCR program. The data include murders and
nonnegligent manslaughters in the United States from
January 1980 to December 2013; that is, negligent
manslaughters and justifiable homicides have been
eliminated from the data. Based on law enforcement
agency reports, the FBI estimates that 640,277
murders (including nonnegligent manslaughters) were
committed from 1980 to 2013. Agencies provided
detailed information on 573,716 of these homicide
victims. SHR estimates in this report have been
revised from those in previously published reports.
About 90 percent of homicides are included in the
SHR program. However, adjustments can be made
to the weights to correct for missing victim reports.
Estimates from the SHR program used in this report
were generated by the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS). Weights have been developed to compensate for
the average annual 10 percent of homicides that were
not reported to the SHR data file. The development
of the set of annual weights is a three-step process.
Each year the FBI’s annual Crime in the United States
report presents a national estimate of murder victims
in the United States and estimates of the number
of murder victims in each of the 50 states and the
District of Columbia. The first-stage weight uses the
FBI’s annual estimates of murder victims in each state
and the number of murder victims from that state
found in the annual SHR database.
Specifically, the first-stage weight for victims in state
S in year Y is—
FBI’s estimate of murder victims in state S(year Y)
Number of murder victims in the SHR file
from state S(year Y)
For complete reporting states, this first-stage weight
is equal to 1. For partial reporting states, this weight
is greater than 1. For states with a first-stage weight
greater than 2—that is, the state reported SHR data
for less than half of the FBI’s estimated number of
murder victims in the state—the first-stage weight
is set to 1.
The second-stage weight uses the FBI’s annual
national estimates of murder victims in the United
States and the sum of the first-stage weights for each
state. The second-stage weight for victims in all states
in year Y is—
FBI’s estimate of murder victims
in the United States(year Y)
Sum of the first-stage weights of all states(year Y)

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2015

197

The third step in the process is to calculate the final
annual victim-level SHR weight. This weight used to
develop national estimates of the attributes of murder
victims is—
SHR weight(year Y) =
(First-stage weight(year Y))*(Second-stage weight(year Y))
Conceptually, the first-stage weight uses a state’s
own reported SHR records to represent all murder
victims in that state, as long as at least 50 percent of
the estimated number of murder victims in that state
has a record in the SHR. The sum of the first-stage
weights then equals the sum of the total number of
all murder victims in states with at least 50 percent
SHR coverage and the simple count of those victims
from the other reporting states. The second-stage
weight is used to inflate the first-stage weights so that
the weight derived from the product of the first- and
second-stage weights represents all murder victims
in that year in the United States. The difference
between the sum of the first-stage weights and the
FBI’s annual national estimate of murder victims
is the unreported murder victims in states with
less than 50 percent SHR coverage and the murder
victims in states that report no data to the SHR in
that year. The second-stage weight compensates for
this difference by assuming that the attributes of the
nonreported victims are similar to the attributes of
weighted murder victims in that year’s SHR database.
The weighting procedure outlined above assumes that
the characteristics of unreported homicide incidents
are similar to the characteristics of reported incidents.
There is no comprehensive way to assess the validity
of this assumption. There is one exception to this
weighting process. Some states did not report any
data in some years. For example, Florida reported
no incidents to the SHR program for the years
1988 through 2013. The annual national weights,
however, attempt to compensate for those few
instances in which entire states did not report any
data. For additional information about the SHR

Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting
System Fatal (WISQARS™ Fatal)
WISQARS™ Fatal provides mortality data related to
injury. The mortality data reported in WISQARS™
Fatal come from death certificate data reported to
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data
include causes of death reported by attending
physicians, medical examiners, and coroners and
demographic information about decedents reported
by funeral directors, who obtain that information
from family members and other informants. NCHS
collects, compiles, verifies, and prepares these data for
release to the public. The data provide information
about unintentional injuries, homicide, and suicide
as leading causes of death, how common they are,
and whom they affect. These data are intended for
a broad audience—the public, the media, public
health practitioners and researchers, and public health
officials—to increase their knowledge of injury.
WISQARS™ Fatal mortality reports provide tables
of the total numbers of injury-related deaths and the
death rates per 100,000 U.S. population. The reports
list deaths according to cause (mechanism) and intent
(manner) of injury by state, race, Hispanic origin,
sex, and age groupings. For more information on

National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS),
administered for the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS) by the U.S. Census Bureau, is the nation’s
primary source of information on crime and the
victims of crime. Initiated in 1972 and redesigned
in 1992, the NCVS collects detailed information
on the frequency and nature of the crimes of rape,
sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault,
theft, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft
experienced by Americans and American households
each year. The survey measures both crimes reported
to police and crimes not reported to the police.
NCVS estimates reported in Indicators of School
Crime and Safety: 2013 and beyond may differ from

those in previous published reports. This is because a
small number of victimizations, referred to as series
victimizations, are included in this report using
a new counting strategy. High-frequency repeat
victimizations, or series victimizations, refer to
situations in which six or more similar but separate
victimizations that occur with such frequency that
the victim is unable to recall each individual event or
describe each event in detail. As part of ongoing research
efforts associated with the redesign of the NCVS, BJS
investigated ways to include high-frequency repeat
victimizations, or series victimizations, in estimates
of criminal victimization, which would result in more
accurate estimates of victimization. BJS has decided
to include series victimizations using the victim’s
estimates of the number of times the victimization
occurred over the past 6 months, capping the number
of victimizations within each series at 10. This strategy
balances the desire to estimate national rates and
account for the experiences of persons who have been
subjected to repeat victimizations against the desire to
minimize the estimation errors that can occur when
repeat victimizations are reported. Including series
victimizations in national rates results in rather large
increases in the level of violent victimization; however,
trends in violence are generally similar regardless
of whether series victimizations are included. For

In the 2006 NCVS, changes in the sample design and
survey methodology may have affected the survey’s
estimates. Caution should be used when comparing
2006 estimates to estimates of other years. Data from
2007 onward are comparable to earlier years. Analyses
of the 2007 estimates indicate that the program
changes made in 2006 had relatively small effects
on NCVS estimates. For more information on the
2006 NCVS data, see Criminal Victimization, 2006
at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv06.pdf,

Readers should note that in 2003, in accordance
with changes to the U.S. Office of Management and
Budget’s standards for classifying federal data on
race and ethnicity, the NCVS item on race/ethnicity
was modified. A question on Hispanic origin is now
followed by a new question about race. The new
question about race allows the respondent to choose
more than one race and delineates Asian as a separate
category from Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific
Islander. An analysis conducted by the Demographic
Surveys Division at the U.S. Census Bureau showed
that the new race question had very little impact on the
aggregate racial distribution of NCVS respondents,
with one exception: There was a 1.6 percentage
point decrease in the percentage of respondents who
reported themselves as White. Due to changes in race/
ethnicity categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity
across years should be made with caution.

The first NCVS interview with a housing unit is
conducted in person. Subsequent interviews are
conducted by telephone, if possible. About 80,000
persons age 12 and older are interviewed every
6  months. Households remain in the sample for
3 years and are interviewed seven times at 6-month
intervals. Since the survey’s inception, the initial
interview at each sample unit has been used only to
bound future interviews to establish a time frame
to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered in these
subsequent interviews. Beginning in 2006, data from
the initial interview have been adjusted to account
for the effects of bounding and have been included
in the survey estimates. After a household has been
interviewed its seventh time, it is replaced by a new
sample household. In 2014, the household response
rate was about 84 percent, and the completion rate
for persons within households was about 87 percent.

The number of NCVS-eligible households in the
2014 sample was approximately 90,380. Households
were selected using a stratified, multistage cluster
design. In the first stage, the primary sampling units
(PSUs), consisting of counties or groups of counties,
were selected. In the second stage, smaller areas,
called Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected
from each sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs,
clusters of four households, called segments, were
selected for interviews. At each stage, the selection
was done proportionate to population size in order to
create a self-weighting sample. The final sample was
augmented to account for households constructed
after the decennial Census. Within each sampled
household, the U.S. Census Bureau interviewer
attempts to interview all household members age
12 and older to determine whether they had been
victimized by the measured crimes during the
6 months preceding the interview.

School Crime Supplement (SCS)
Created as a supplement to the NCVS and co-designed
by the National Center for Education Statistics
and Bureau of Justice Statistics, the School Crime
Supplement (SCS) survey has been conducted in 1989,
1995, and biennially since 1999 to collect additional
information about school-related victimizations on
a national level. This report includes data from the
1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, and
2013 collections. The 1989 data are not included in
this report as a result of methodological changes to
the NCVS and SCS. The SCS was designed to assist
policymakers, as well as academic researchers and
practitioners at federal, state, and local levels, to make
informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The
survey asks students a number of key questions about
their experiences with and perceptions of crime and
violence that occurred inside their school, on school
grounds, on the school bus, or on the way to or from
school. Students are asked additional questions about
security measures used by their school, students’
participation in after-school activities, students’
perceptions of school rules, the presence of weapons
and gangs in school, the presence of hate-related words
and graffiti in school, student reports of bullying and
reports of rejection at school, and the availability of
drugs and alcohol in school. Students are also asked
attitudinal questions relating to fear of victimization
and avoidance behavior at school.
The SCS survey was conducted for a 6-month period
from January through June in all households selected
for the NCVS (see discussion above for information
about the NCVS sampling design and changes to the
race/ethnicity variable beginning in 2003). Within
these households, the eligible respondents for the SCS
were those household members who had attended
school at any time during the 6 months preceding
the interview, were enrolled in grades 6–12, and were
not homeschooled. In 2007, the questionnaire was
changed and household members who attended school
sometime during the school year of the interview were
included. The age range of students covered in this
report is 12–18 years of age. Eligible respondents were
asked the supplemental questions in the SCS only after
200

Appendix A: Technical Notes

completing their entire NCVS interview. It should be
noted that the first or unbounded NCVS interview
has always been included in analysis of the SCS data
and may result in the reporting of events outside of
the requested reference period.
The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999,
2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013
was calculated by using NCVS incident variables
appended to the SCS data files of the same year. The
NCVS type of crime variable was used to classify
victimizations of students in the SCS as serious violent,
violent, or theft. The NCVS variables asking where the
incident happened (at school) and what the victim was
doing when it happened (attending school or on the
way to or from school) were used to ascertain whether
the incident happened at school. Only incidents that
occurred inside the United States are included.
In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modified
from previous collections. First, in 1995 and 1999, “at
school” was defined for respondents as in the school
building, on the school grounds, or on a school bus.
In 2001, the definition for “at school” was changed
to mean in the school building, on school property,
on a school bus, or going to and from school. This
change was made to the 2001 questionnaire in order
to be consistent with the definition of “at school” as it
is constructed in the NCVS and was also used as the
definition in subsequent SCS collections. Cognitive
interviews conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on
the 1999 SCS suggested that modifications to the
definition of “at school” would not have a substantial
impact on the estimates.
A total of about 9,700 students participated in the
1995 SCS, 8,400 in 1999, 8,400 in 2001, 7,200 in
2003, 6,300 in 2005, 5,600 in 2007, 5,000 in 2009,
6,500 in 2011, and 5,700 in 2013. In the 2013 SCS,
the household completion rate was 86 percent.
In the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009,
2011, and 2013 SCS, the household completion rates
were 95 percent, 94 percent, 93 percent, 92 percent,
91 percent, 90 percent, 92 percent, 91 percent, and
86 percent respectively, and the student completion
rates were 78 percent, 78 percent, 77 percent,
70  percent, 62 percent, 58 percent, 56 percent,
63 percent, and 60 percent respectively. The overall
unweighted SCS unit response rate (calculated by
multiplying the household completion rate by the
student completion rate) was about 74 percent in 1995,
73 percent in 1999, 72 percent in 2001, 64 percent
in 2003, 56 percent in 2005, 53 percent in 2007,
51 percent in 2009, 57 percent in 2011, and 51 percent
in 2013.

There are two types of nonresponse: unit and item
nonresponse. NCES requires that any stage of data
collection within a survey that has a unit base-weighted
response rate of less than 85 percent be evaluated for
the potential magnitude of unit nonresponse bias
before the data or any analysis using the data may be
released (U.S. Department of Education 2003). Due
to the low unit response rate in 2005, 2007, 2009,
2011, and 2013, a unit nonresponse bias analysis
was done. Unit response rates indicate how many
sampled units have completed interviews. Because
interviews with students could only be completed
after households had responded to the NCVS, the
unit completion rate for the SCS reflects both the
household interview completion rate and the student
interview completion rate. Nonresponse can greatly
affect the strength and application of survey data
by leading to an increase in variance as a result of
a reduction in the actual size of the sample and can
produce bias if the nonrespondents have characteristics
of interest that are different from the respondents. In
order for response bias to occur, respondents must have
different response rates and responses to particular
survey variables. The magnitude of unit nonresponse
bias is determined by the response rate and the
differences between respondents and nonrespondents
on key survey variables. Although the bias analysis
cannot measure response bias since the SCS is a sample
survey and it is not known how the population would
have responded, the SCS sampling frame has four key
student or school characteristic variables for which
data are known for respondents and nonrespondents:
sex, race/ethnicity, household income, and urbanicity,
all of which are associated with student victimization.
To the extent that there are differential responses by
respondents in these groups, nonresponse bias is a
concern.
In 2005, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of bias for the race, household income,
and urbanicity variables. White (non-Hispanic)
and Other (non-Hispanic) respondents had higher
response rates than Black (non-Hispanic) and
Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households
with an income of $35,000–$49,999 and $50,000
or more had higher response rates than those from
households with incomes of less than $7,500,
$7,500–$14,999, $15,000–$24,999 and $25,000–
$34,999. Respondents who live in urban areas had
lower response rates than those who live in rural or
suburban areas. Although the extent of nonresponse
bias cannot be determined, weighting adjustments,
which corrected for differential response rates, should
have reduced the problem.

In 2007, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias
found evidence of bias by the race/ethnicity and
household income variables. Hispanic respondents
had lower response rates than other races/ethnicities.
Respondents from households with an income of
$25,000 or more had higher response rates than those
from households with incomes of less than $25,000.
However, when responding students are compared to
the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable
differences between the responding students and the
eligible students, suggesting that the nonresponse bias
has little impact on the overall estimates.
In 2009, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of potential bias for the race/ethnicity and
urbanicity variables. White students and students of
other races/ethnicities had higher response rates than
did Black and Hispanic respondents. Respondents
from households located in rural areas had higher
response rates than those from households located in
urban areas. However, when responding students are
compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were
no measurable differences between the responding
students and the eligible students, suggesting
that the nonresponse bias has little impact on the
overall estimates.
In 2011, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of potential bias for the age variable.
Respondents 12 to 17 years old had higher response
rates than did 18-year-old respondents in the NCVS
and SCS interviews. Weighting the data adjusts for
unequal selection probabilities and for the effects of
nonresponse. The weighting adjustments that correct
for differential response rates are created by region,
age, race, and sex, and should have reduced the effect
of nonresponse.
In 2013, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of potential bias for the age, region, and
Hispanic origin variable in the NCVS interview
response. Within the SCS portion of the data, only
the age and region variables showed significant unit
nonresponse bias. Further analysis indicated only the
age 14 and the west region categories showed positive
response biases that were significantly different from
some of the other categories within the age and region
variables. Based on the analysis, nonresponse bias
seems to have little impact on the SCS results.
Response rates for most SCS survey items in all
survey years were high—typically over 97 percent
of all eligible respondents, meaning there is little
potential for item nonresponse bias for most items in
the survey. Weights were developed to compensate for
differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse.

Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)
The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System
(YRBSS) is an epidemiological surveillance system
developed by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) to monitor the prevalence of youth
behaviors that most influence health. The YRBSS
focuses on priority health-risk behaviors established
during youth that result in the most significant
mortality, morbidity, disability, and social problems
during both youth and adulthood. The YRBSS
includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior
Survey (YRBS) as well as surveys conducted in states
and large urban school districts. This report uses 1993,
1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009,
2011, and 2013 YRBSS data.
The national YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling
design to produce a nationally representative sample
of students in grades 9–12 in the United States. The
target population consisted of all public and private
school students in grades 9–12 in the 50 states and the
District of Columbia. The first-stage sampling frame
included selecting primary sampling units (PSUs)
from strata formed on the basis of urbanization and
the relative percentage of Black and Hispanic students
in the PSU. These PSUs are either counties; subareas of
large counties; or groups of smaller, adjacent counties.
At the second stage, schools were selected with
probability proportional to school enrollment size.
The final stage of sampling consisted of randomly
selecting, in each chosen school and in each of
grades 9–12, one or two classrooms from either a
required subject, such as English or social studies,
or a required period, such as homeroom or second
period. All students in selected classes were eligible
to participate. In surveys conducted before 2013,
three strategies were used to oversample Black and
Hispanic students: (1) larger sampling rates were
used to select PSUs that are in high-Black and highHispanic strata; (2) a modified measure of size was
202

Appendix A: Technical Notes

used that increased the probability of selecting schools
with a disproportionately high minority enrollment;
and (3) two classes per grade, rather than one,
were selected in schools with a high percentage of
combined Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or
American Indian/Alaska Native enrollment. In 2013,
only selection of two classes per grade was needed
to achieve an adequate precision with minimum
variance. Approximately 16,300 students participated
in the 1993 survey, 10,900 students participated in
the 1995 survey, 16,300 students participated in
the 1997 survey, 15,300 students participated in the
1999 survey, 13,600 students participated in the 2001
survey, 15,200 students participated in the 2003
survey, 13,900 students participated in the 2005
survey, 14,000 students participated in the 2007
survey, 16,400 students participated in the 2009
survey, 15,400 participated in the 2011 survey, and
13,600 participated in the 2013 survey.
The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993
survey, 60 percent for the 1995 survey, 69 percent
for the 1997 survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey,
63 percent for the 2001 survey, 67 percent for the 2003
survey, 67 percent for the 2005 survey, 68 percent
for the 2007 survey, 71 percent for the 2009 survey,
71 percent for the 2011 survey, and 68 percent for the
2013 survey. NCES standards call for response rates
of 85 percent or better for cross-sectional surveys,
and bias analyses are required by NCES when that
percentage is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full
nonresponse bias analysis has not been done because
the data necessary to do the analysis are not available.
The weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse
and the oversampling of Black and Hispanic students
in the sample. The final weights were constructed
so that only weighted proportions of students (not
weighted counts of students) in each grade matched
national population projections.
State-level data were downloaded from the Youth
Online: Comprehensive Results web page (http://
nccd.cdc.gov/YouthOnline/). Each state and district
school-based YRBS employs a two-stage, cluster
sample design to produce representative samples of
students in grades 9–12 in their jurisdiction. All except
a few state samples, and all district samples, include
only public schools, and each district sample includes
only schools in the funded school district (e.g., San
Diego Unified School District) rather than in the
entire city (e.g., greater San Diego area).
In the first sampling stage in all except a few states
and districts, schools are selected with probability
proportional to school enrollment size. In the second
sampling stage, intact classes of a required subject or
intact classes during a required period (e.g., second
period) are selected randomly. All students in sampled

classes are eligible to participate. Certain states and
districts modify these procedures to meet their
individual needs. For example, in a given state or
district, all schools, rather than a sample of schools,
might be selected to participate. State and local surveys
that have a scientifically selected sample, appropriate
documentation, and an overall response rate greater
than or equal to 60 percent are weighted. The
overall response rate reflects the school response rate
multiplied by the student response rate. These three
criteria are used to ensure that the data from those
surveys can be considered representative of students
in grades 9–12 in that jurisdiction. A weight is applied
to each record to adjust for student nonresponse and
the distribution of students by grade, sex, and race/
ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore, weighted
estimates are representative of all students in grades
9–12 attending schools in each jurisdiction. Surveys
that do not have an overall response rate of greater
than or equal to 60 percent and that do not have
appropriate documentation are not weighted and are
not included in this report.
In 2013, a total of 42 states and 21 districts had
weighted data. Not all of the districts were contained
in the 42 states. For example, California was not
one of the 42 states that obtained weighted data
but it contained several districts that did. For more
information on the location of the districts, please see
http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/participation.
htm. In sites with weighted data, the student sample
sizes for the state and district YRBS ranged from 1,107
to 53,785. School response rates ranged from 70 to
100 percent, student response rates ranged from 60
to 94 percent, and overall response rates ranged from
60 to 87 percent.
Readers should note that reports of these data
published by the CDC and in this report do not
include percentages where the denominator includes
less than 100 unweighted cases.
In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office
of Management and Budget’s standards for the
classification of federal data on race and ethnicity,
the YRBS item on race/ethnicity was modified. The
version of the race and ethnicity question used in 1993,
1995, and 1997 was:
How do you describe yourself?
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.

White—not Hispanic
Black—not Hispanic
Hispanic or Latino
Asian or Pacific Islander
American Indian or Alaskan Native
Other

The version used in 1999, 2001, 2003, and in
the 2005, 2007, and 2009 state and local district
surveys  was:
How do you describe yourself? (Select one or more
responses.)
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.

American Indian or Alaska Native
Asian
Black or African American
Hispanic or Latino
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
White

In the 2005 national survey and in all 2007, 2009,
2011, and 2013 surveys, race/ethnicity was computed
from two questions: (1) “Are you Hispanic or Latino?”
(response options were “yes” and “no”), and (2) “What
is your race?” (response options were “American
Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian,” “Black or African
American,” “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific
Islander,” or “White”). For the second question,
students could select more than one response option.
For this report, students were classified as “Hispanic”
if they answered “yes” to the first question, regardless
of how they answered the second question. Students
who answered “no” to the first question and selected
more than one race/ethnicity in the second category
were classified as “More than one race.” Students who
answered “no” to the first question and selected only
one race/ethnicity were classified as that race/ethnicity.
Race/ethnicity was classified as missing for students
who did not answer the first question and for students
who answered “no” to the first question but did not
answer the second question.
CDC has conducted two studies to understand the
effect of changing the race/ethnicity item on the
YRBS. Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found
that allowing students to select more than one
response to a single race/ethnicity question on the
YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/
ethnicity among high school students. Eaton et al.
(2007) found that self-reported race/ethnicity was
similar regardless of whether the single-question
or a two-question format was used. For additional

Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS)
The Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) is a set of
related questionnaires that collect descriptive data
on the context of public and private elementary and
secondary education. Data reported by districts,
schools, principals, and teachers provide a variety
of statistics on the condition of education in the
United States that may be used by policymakers
and the general public. The SASS system covers a
wide range of topics, including teacher demand,
teacher and principal characteristics, teachers’ and
principals’ perceptions of school climate and problems
in their schools, teacher and principal compensation,
district hiring and retention practices, general
conditions in schools, and basic characteristics of the
student population.
SASS data are collected through a mail questionnaire
with telephone and in-person field follow-up. SASS
has been conducted by the Census Bureau for NCES
since the first administration of the survey, which
was conducted during the 1987–88 school year.
Subsequent SASS administrations were conducted in
1990–91, 1993–94, 1999–2000, 2003–04, 2007–08,
and 2011–12.
SASS is designed to produce national, regional, and
state estimates for public elementary and secondary
schools, school districts, principals, teachers, and
school library media centers; and national and
regional estimates for public charter schools, as well as
principals, teachers, and school library media centers
within these schools. For private schools, the sample
supports national, regional, and affiliation estimates
for schools, principals, and teachers.
From its inception, SASS has had four core components:
school questionnaires, teacher questionnaires,
principal questionnaires, and school district (prior
to 1999–2000, “teacher demand and shortage”)
questionnaires. A fifth component, school library
media center questionnaires, was introduced in the
1993–94 administration and has been included in
every subsequent administration of SASS. School
library data were also collected in the 1990–91
administration of the survey through the school and
principal questionnaires.
School questionnaires used in SASS include the
Public and Private School Questionnaires; teacher
questionnaires include the Public and Private School
Teacher Questionnaires; principal questionnaires
include the Public and Private School Principal (or
School Administrator) Questionnaires, and school
district questionnaires include the School District
(or Teacher Demand and Shortage) Questionnaires.
204

Appendix A: Technical Notes

Although the four core questionnaires and the school
library media questionnaires have remained relatively
stable over the various administrations of SASS, the
survey has changed to accommodate emerging issues
in elementary and secondary education. Some items
have been added, some have been deleted, and some
questionnaire items have been reworded.
During the 1990–91 SASS cycle, NCES worked
with the Office of Indian Education to add an Indian
School Questionnaire to SASS, and it remained a
part of SASS through 2007–08. The Indian School
Questionnaire explores the same school-level issues
that the Public and Private School Questionnaires
explore, allowing comparisons among the three types
of schools. The 1990–91, 1993–94, 1999–2000,
2003–04, and 2007–08 administrations of SASS
obtained data on Bureau of Indian Education (BIE)
schools (schools funded or operated by the BIE), but
the 2011–12 administration did not obtain BIE data.
SASS estimates for all survey years presented in this
report exclude BIE schools, and as a result, estimates
in this report may differ from those in previously
published reports.
School library media center questionnaires were
administered in public, private, and BIE schools as
part of the 1993–94 and 1999–2000 SASS. During
the 2003–04 administration of SASS, only library
media centers in public schools were surveyed, and
in 2007–08 library media centers in public schools
and BIE and BIE-funded schools were surveyed.
The 2011–12 survey collected data only on school
library media centers in traditional public schools
and in public charter schools. School library questions
focused on facilities, services and policies, staffing,
technology, information literacy, collections and
expenditures, and media equipment. New or revised
topics included access to online licensed databases,
resource availability, and additional elements on
information literacy. The Student Records and
Library Media Specialist/Librarian Questionnaires
were administered only in 1993–94.
As part of the 1999–2000 SASS, the Charter School
Questionnaire was sent to the universe of charter
schools in operation in 1998–99. In 2003–04 and in
subsequent administrations of SASS, charter schools
were included in the public school sample as opposed
to being sent a separate questionnaire. Another change
in the 2003–04 administration of SASS was a revised
data collection procedure using a primary in-person
contact within the school intended to reduce the field
follow-up phase.
The SASS teacher surveys collect information on the
characteristics of teachers, such as their age, race/
ethnicity, years of teaching experience, average number

of hours per week spent on teaching activities, base
salary, average class size, and highest degree earned.
These teacher-reported data may be combined with
related information on their school’s characteristics,
such as school type (e.g., public traditional, public
charter, Catholic, private other religious, and
private nonsectarian), community type, and school
enrollment size. The teacher questionnaires also ask
for information on teacher opinions regarding the
school and teaching environment. In 1993–94, about
53,000 public school teachers and 10,400 private
school teachers were sampled. In 1999–2000, about
56,300 public school teachers, 4,400 public charter
school teachers, and 10,800 private school teachers
were sampled. In 2003–04, about 52,500 public
school teachers and 10,000 private school teachers
were sampled. In 2007–08, about 48,400 public
school teachers and 8,200 private school teachers
were sampled. In 2011–12, about 51,100 public
school teachers and 7,100 private school teachers were
sampled. Weighted overall response rates in 2011–12
were 61.8 percent for public school teachers and
50.1 percent for private school teachers.
The SASS principal surveys focus on such topics as
age, race/ethnicity, sex, average annual salary, years
of experience, highest degree attained, perceived
influence on decisions made at the school, and hours
spent per week on all school activities. These data
on principals can be placed in the context of other
SASS data, such as the type of the principal’s school
(e.g., public traditional, public charter, Catholic, other
religious, or nonsectarian), enrollment, and percentage
of students eligible for free or reduced price lunch.
In 2003–04, about 10,200 public school principals
were sampled, and in 2007–08, about 9,800 public
school principals were sampled. In 2011–12, about
11,000 public school principals and 3,000 private
school principals were sampled. Weighted response
rates in 2011–12 for public school principals and
private school principals were 72.7 percent and
64.7 percent, respectively.
The SASS 2011–12 sample of schools was confined
to the 50 states and the District of Columbia and
excludes the other jurisdictions, the Department
of Defense overseas schools, the BIE schools, and
schools that do not offer teacher-provided classroom
instruction in grades 1–12 or the ungraded equivalent.
The SASS 2011–12 sample included 10,250 traditional
public schools, 750 public charter schools, and 3,000
private schools.
The public school sample for the 2011–12 SASS
was based on an adjusted public school universe file
from the 2009–10 Common Core of Data (CCD),
a database of all the nation’s public school districts

and public schools. The private school sample for
the 2011–12 SASS was selected from the 2009–10
Private School Universe Survey (PSS), as updated for
the 2011–12 PSS. This update collected membership
lists from private school associations and religious
denominations, as well as private school lists from state
education departments. The 2011–12 SASS private
school frame was further augmented by the inclusion
of additional schools that were identified through the
2009–10 PSS area frame data collection.
Additional resources available regarding SASS

School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)
The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)
is managed by the National Center for Education
Statistics (NCES) on behalf of the U.S. Department
of Education. SSOCS collects extensive crime and
safety data from principals and school administrators
of U.S. public schools. Data from this collection can
be used to examine the relationship between school
characteristics and violent and serious violent crimes
in primary schools, middle schools, high schools, and
combined schools. In addition, data from SSOCS can
be used to assess what crime prevention programs,
practices, and policies are used by schools. SSOCS has
been conducted in school years 1999–2000, 2003–04,
2005–06, 2007–08, and 2009–10.
SSOCS was developed by NCES and is funded by
the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools of the U.S.
Department of Education. The 2009–10 SSOCS
(SSOCS: 2010) was conducted by the U.S. Census
Bureau. Data collection began on February 24,
2010, when questionnaire packets were mailed to
sampled schools, and continued through June 11,
2010. A total of 2,648 public schools submitted usable
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2015

205

questionnaires: 684 primary schools, 909 middle
schools, 948 high schools, and 107 combined schools.
The sampling frame for SSOCS: 2010 was constructed
from the 2007–08 Public Elementary/Secondary
School Universe data file of the Common Core of
Data (CCD), an annual collection of data on all
public K–12 schools and school districts. The SSOCS
sampling frame was restricted to regular public schools
in the United States and the District of Columbia
(including charter schools).
A total of 3,476 schools were selected for the 2010
study. In February 2010, questionnaires were mailed
to school principals, who were asked to complete the
survey or to have it completed by the person most
knowledgeable about discipline issues at the school.
A total of 2,648 schools completed the survey. The
weighted overall response rate was 80.8 percent.1
A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted on
the 3  items with weighted item nonresponse rates
below 85 percent. The detected bias was not deemed
problematic enough to suppress any items from the
data file. A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted
to evaluate the extent of bias for any survey stage
with a base-weighted unit response rate less than
85 percent. Responding and nonresponding schools
were compared across the characteristics available
for both groups: school level, enrollment size, locale,
percent White enrollment, region, number of full-time
equivalent (FTE) teachers, student-to-teacher ratio,
and percentage of students eligible for free or reducedprice lunch. This analysis indicated that there were
no measurable differences between the responding
schools and the full sample of schools, suggesting that
nonresponse bias is not an issue for SSOCS: 2010.
Weights were developed to adjust for the variable
probabilities of selection and differential nonresponse
and can be used to produce national estimates for
regular public schools in the 2009–10 school year. For
information on the 1999–2000, 2003–04, 2005–06,
2007–08, and 2009–10 iterations, see Neiman (2011).

sampling rates to the following ratio: completed cases/(total
sample - known ineligibles).

Appendix A: Technical Notes

Fast Response Survey System (FRSS)
The Fast Response Survey System (FRSS), established
in 1975, collects issue-oriented data quickly, with a
minimal burden on respondents. The FRSS, whose
surveys collect and report data on key education issues
at the elementary and secondary levels, was designed
to meet the data needs of Department of Education
analysts, planners, and decisionmakers when
information could not be collected quickly through
NCES’s large recurring surveys. Findings from FRSS
surveys have been included in congressional reports,
testimony to congressional subcommittees, NCES
reports, and other Department of Education reports.
The findings are also often used by state and local
education officials.
Data collected through FRSS surveys are representative
at the national level, drawing from a sample that is
appropriate for each study. The FRSS collects data
from state education agencies and national samples
of other educational organizations and participants,
including local education agencies, public and private
elementary and secondary schools, elementary and
secondary school teachers and principals, and public
libraries and school libraries. To ensure a minimal
burden on respondents, the surveys are generally
limited to three pages of questions, with a response
burden of about 30 minutes per respondent. Sample
sizes are relatively small (usually about 1,000 to 1,500
respondents per survey) so that data collection can
be completed quickly.
The FRSS survey “School Safety and Discipline:
2013–14” (FRSS 106) collected information on
specific safety and discipline plans and practices,
training for classroom teachers and aides related to
school safety and discipline issues, security personnel,
frequency of specific discipline problems, and number
of incidents of various offenses. The sample for the
“School Safety and Discipline: 2013–14” survey was
selected from the 2011–12 Common Core of Data
(CCD) Public School Universe file. Approximately
1,600 regular public elementary, middle, and high
school/combined schools in the 50  states and the
District of Columbia were selected for the study.
(For the purposes of the study, “regular” schools
included charter schools.) In February 2014,
questionnaires and cover letters were mailed to
the principal of each sampled school. The letter
requested that the questionnaire be completed by
the person most knowledgeable about discipline
issues at the school, and respondents were offered the
option of completing the survey either on paper or
online. Telephone follow-up for survey nonresponse

and data clarification was initiated in March 2014
and completed in July 2014. About 1,350 schools
completed the survey. The weighted response rate
was 85 percent.
One of the goals of the FRSS “School Safety and
Discipline: 2013–14” survey is to allow comparisons
to the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)
data. Consistent with the approach used on SSOCS,
respondents were asked to report for the current
2013–14 school year to date. Information about
violent incidents that occurred in the school between
the time that the survey was completed and the end
of the school year are not included in the survey data.

Campus Safety and Security Survey
The Campus Safety and Security Survey is administered
by the Office of Postsecondary Education. Since 1990,
all postsecondary institutions participating in Title IV
student financial aid programs have been required to
comply with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus
Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, known
as the Clery Act. Originally, Congress enacted the
Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act, which
was amended in 1992, 1998, and again in 2000. The
1998 amendments renamed the law the Jeanne Clery
Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus
Crime Statistics Act. The Clery Act requires schools to
give timely warnings of crimes to the student body
and staff; to publicize campus crime and safety
policies; and to collect, report, and disseminate
campus crime data.
Crime statistics are collected and disseminated by
campus security authorities. These authorities include
campus police; nonpolice security staff responsible
for monitoring campus property; municipal, county,
or state law enforcement agencies with institutional
agreements for security services; individuals and offices
designated by the campus security policies as those to
whom crimes should be reported; and officials of the
institution with significant responsibility for student
and campus activities. The act requires disclosure for
offenses committed at geographic locations associated
with each institution. For on-campus crimes, this

includes property and buildings owned or controlled
by the institution. In addition to on-campus crimes,
the act requires disclosure of crimes committed in
or on a noncampus building or property owned or
controlled by the institution for educational purposes
or for recognized student organizations, and on public
property within or immediately adjacent to and
accessible from the campus.
There are three types of statistics described in this
report: criminal offenses; arrests for illegal weapons
possession and violation of drug and liquor laws; and
disciplinary referrals for illegal weapons possession
and violation of drug and liquor laws. Criminal
offenses include homicide, sex offenses, robbery,
aggravated assaults, burglary, motor vehicle theft,
and arson. Only the most serious offense is counted
when more than one offense was committed during
an incident. The two other categories, arrests and
referrals, include counts for illegal weapons possession
and violation of drug and liquor laws. Arrests and
referrals relate to only those that are in violation of the
law and not just in violation of institutional policies. If
no federal, state, or local law was violated, these events
are not reported. Further, if an individual is arrested
and referred for disciplinary action for an offense,
only the arrest is counted. Arrest is defined to include
persons processed by arrest, citation, or summons,
including those arrested and released without formal
charges being placed. Referral for disciplinary action
is defined to include persons referred to any official
who initiates a disciplinary action of which a record
is kept and which may result in the imposition of a
sanction. Referrals may or may not involve the police
or other law enforcement agencies.
All criminal offenses and arrests may include students,
faculty, staff, and the general public. These offenses
may or may not involve students that are enrolled in
the institution. Referrals primarily deal with persons
associated formally with the institution (i.e., students,
faculty, staff).
Campus security and police statistics do not necessarily
reflect the total amount or even the nature of crime
on campus. Rather, they reflect incidents that have
been reported and recorded by campus security and/
or local police. The process of reporting and recording
alleged criminal incidents involve some well-known
social filters and steps beginning with the victim. First,
the victim or some other party must recognize that
a possible crime has occurred and report the event.
The event must then be recorded, and if it is recorded,
the nature and type of offense must be classified. This
classification may differ from the initial report due to
the collection of additional evidence, interviews with
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2015

207

witnesses, or through officer discretion. Also, the date
an incident is reported may be much later than the
date of the actual incident. For example, a victim may
not realize something was stolen until much later, or a
victim of violence may wait a number of days to report
a crime. Other factors are related to the probability
that an incident is reported, including the severity of
the event, the victim’s confidence and prior experience
with the police or security agency, or influence from
third parties (e.g., friends and family knowledgeable
about the incident). Finally the reader should be
mindful that these figures represent alleged criminal
offenses reported to campus security and/or local
police within a given year, and they do not necessarily
reflect prosecutions or convictions for crime. More
information on the reporting of campus crime and
safety data may be obtained from: The Handbook for
Campus Safety and Security Reporting http://www2.

EDFacts
EDFacts is a centralized data collection through
which state education agencies submit K–12 education
data to the U.S. Department of Education (ED). All
data in EDFacts are organized into “data groups”
and reported to ED using defined file specifications.
Depending on the data group, state education
agencies may submit aggregate counts for the state
as a whole or detailed counts for individual schools
or school districts. EDFacts does not collect studentlevel records. The entities that are required to report
EDFacts data vary by data group but may include the
50 states, the District of Columbia, the Department
of Defense (DoD) dependents schools, the Bureau of
Indian Education, Puerto Rico, American Samoa,
Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S.
Virgin Islands. More information about EDFacts file
specifications and data groups can be found at http://
www.ed.gov/edfacts.
EDFacts is a universe collection and is not subject
to sampling error, but nonsampling errors such as
nonresponse and inaccurate reporting may occur. The
U.S. Department of Education attempts to minimize
nonsampling errors by training data submission
coordinators and reviewing the quality of state data
submissions. However, anomalies may still be present
in the data.
Differences in state data collection systems may limit
the comparability of EDFacts data across states and
across time. To build EDFacts files, state education
208

Appendix A: Technical Notes

agencies rely on data that were reported by their
schools and school districts. The systems used to
collect these data are evolving rapidly and differ from
state to state. For example, there is a large shift in
California’s firearm incident data between 2010–11
and 2011–12. California cited a new student data
system that more accurately collects firearm incident
data as the reason for the magnitude of the difference.
In some cases, EDFacts data may not align with data
reported on state education agency websites. States
may update their websites on different schedules than
those they use to report to ED. Further, ED may
use methods to protect the privacy of individuals
represented within the data that could be different
from the methods used by an individual state.
EDFacts firearm incidents data are collected in data
group 601 within file 094. EDFacts collects this data
group on behalf of the Office of Safe and Healthy
Students in the Office of Elementary and Secondary
Education. The definition for this data group is “The
number of incidents involving students who brought
or possessed firearms at school.” The reporting period
is the entire school year. Data group 601 collects
separate counts for incidents involving handguns,
rifles/shotguns, other firearms, and multiple weapon
types. The counts reported here exclude the “other
firearms” category. For more information about this
data group, please see file specification 094 for the
relevant school year, available at http://www2.ed.gov/
about/inits/ed/edfacts/file-specifications.html.
EDFacts discipline incidents data are collected in data
group 523 within file 030. EDFacts collects this data
group on behalf of the Office of Safe and Healthy
Students and the School Improvement Grant program
in the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education.
The definition for this data group is “The cumulative
number of times that students were removed from
their regular education program for at least an entire
school day for discipline.” The reporting period is the
entire school year. For more information about this
data group, please see file specification 030 for the
relevant school year, available at http://www2.ed.gov/

Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)
The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for
Civil Rights (OCR) has surveyed the nation’s public
elementary and secondary schools since 1968. The
survey was first known as the OCR Elementary and
Secondary School (E&S) Survey; in 2004, it was
renamed the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC).
The survey provides information about the enrollment
of students in public schools in every state and about
some education services provided to those students.
These data are reported by race/ethnicity, sex, and
disability status.
Data in the survey are collected pursuant to 34 C.F.R.
Section 100.6(b) of the Department of Education
regulation implementing Title VI of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964. The requirements are also incorporated
by reference in Department regulations implementing
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and
the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. School, district,
state, and national data are currently available. Data
from individual public schools and districts are used
to generate projected national and state data.
The CRDC has generally been conducted biennially
in each of the 50 states plus the District of Columbia.
The 2011–12 CRDC, which collected data from
approximately 16,500 school districts and 97,000
schools, was the first CRDC collection since 2000 to
survey every public school district and school in the
nation. Data from the 2011–12 CRDC are currently
available. The 2013–14 CRDC survey also collected
information from a universe of every public school
district and school in the nation.
The 2011–12 CRDC provides data on the number
of students who were disciplined during the 2011–12
school year by the type of action taken: suspensions
(both in-school and out-of-school), expulsions,
referrals to law enforcement, school-related arrests,
and corporal punishments.

High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09)
The High School Longitudinal Study of 2009
(HSLS:09) is a nationally representative, longitudinal
study of approximately 21,000 9th-grade students
in 944 schools who will be followed through their
secondary and postsecondary years. The study
focuses on understanding students’ trajectories from

the beginning of high school into postsecondary
education, the workforce, and beyond. The HSLS:09
questionnaire is focused on, but not limited to,
information on science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM) education and careers. It is
designed to provide data on mathematics and science
education, the changing high school environment,
and postsecondary education. This study features a
new student assessment in algebra skills, reasoning,
and problem solving and includes surveys of students,
their parents, math and science teachers, and school
administrators, as well as a new survey of school
counselors.
The HSLS:09 base year took place in the 2009–10
school year, with a randomly selected sample of
fall-term 9th-graders in more than 900 public and
private high schools that had both a 9th and an 11th
grade. Students took a mathematics assessment and
survey online. Students’ parents, principals, and
mathematics and science teachers and the school’s
lead counselor completed surveys on the phone or
online.
The HSLS:09 student questionnaire includes interest
and motivation items for measuring key factors
predicting choice of postsecondary paths, including
majors and eventual careers. This study explores
the roles of different factors in the development
of a student’s commitment to attend college and
then take the steps necessary to succeed in college
(the right courses, courses in specific sequences,
etc.). Questionnaires in this study have asked
more questions of students and parents regarding
reasons for selecting specific colleges (e.g., academic
programs, financial aid and access prices, and campus
environment).
The first follow-up of HSLS:09 occurred in the spring
of 2012, when most sample members were in the
11th grade. Data files and documentation for the first
follow-up were released in fall 2013 and are available
on the NCES website.
A between-round postsecondary status update
survey took place in the spring of students’ expected
graduation year (2013). It asked respondents about
college applications, acceptances, and rejections, as
well as their actual college choices. In the fall of 2013
and the spring of 2014, high school transcripts were
collected and coded.
A full second follow-up is planned for 2016, when
most sample members will be 3 years beyond high
school graduation. Additional follow-ups are planned,
to at least age 30.
Parents were asked to provide a response about their
child’s suspension and expulsion status on both the
base-year (2009) questionnaire and on the first followup (2012) questionnaire.

Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement
(CJRP)
The Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement
(CJRP), administered for the Office of Juvenile
Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) by
the U.S. Bureau of the Census, provides state and
national data on the characteristics of youth held in
residential placement facilities. First administered in
1997, the CJRP replaced the Census of Public and
Private Juvenile Detention, Correctional, and Shelter
Facilities, also known as the Children in Custody
(CIC) census, which had been conducted since the
early 1970s. The CJRP, which is conducted every
2 years, provides the nation with the most detailed
picture of juveniles in custody ever produced. The
CJRP asks juvenile residential custody facilities in the
United States to describe each youth assigned a bed
in the facility on the fourth Wednesday in October
(the census reference date).2
Public and private facilities are eligible for inclusion
in the CJRP, and tribal facilities have been included
since 1999. Additional inclusion criteria require that
facilities are in operation on the census reference date
and that facilities are primarily intended for juvenile
offenders. Facilities specifically excluded from the
CJRP include nonresidential facilities; detention
centers operated as part of adult jails; facilities
exclusively for drug or mental health treatment
or for abused or neglected children; foster homes;
and federal correctional facilities (e.g., Bureau of
Indian Affairs, U.S. Marshals Service, and Bureau of
Prisons). Youth under age 21 who are assigned a bed in
a residential facility at the end of the day on the census
reference date are included in the CJRP. Youth must
also be charged with an offense or court adjudicated
for an offense and be in residential placement because
of that offense.
The CJRP provides 1-day population counts of
juveniles in residential placement facilities. One-day
counts give a picture of the standing population

Unforeseen circumstances prevented the 2005 and 2009
mailouts from taking place in October. As a result, the census
reference date for the 2005 collection took place on February 22,
2006, and the census reference date for the 2009 collection took
place on February 24, 2010.

in facilities and can differ substantially from the
annual admission and release data used to measure
facility population flow. One-day count statistics are
overrepresentative of those youth with longer lengths
of stay (e.g., more serious offenders or those in longterm placements) and underrepresentative of youth
with short lengths of stay (e.g., those in detention).
Facility information can be generalized to juvenile
residential placement facilities (except those for drug
treatment or mental health only, or for dependents).
The CJRP does not capture data on juveniles held in
adult prisons or jails; therefore, in the CJRP data,
juveniles placed in juvenile facilities by criminal
courts represent an unknown proportion of juveniles
incarcerated by criminal courts.
In mid-October, the Census Bureau mails data
requests to respondents representing public, private,
tribal, and U.S. territory residential juvenile facilities.
Some state and regional agencies provide CJRP data
for more than one facility under their jurisdiction.
The CJRP allows for electronic submission of the
data by larger facilities and central reporters. As
part of this program, the Census Bureau provides
data specifications and a spreadsheet format to
participating respondents so that these respondents
can also complete the form through common
spreadsheet programs. Using the number of in-scope
facilities as a base, the CJRP facility response rate was
96 percent in 1997, 100 percent in 1999, 99 percent
in 2001, 100 percent in 2003, 100 percent in 2006,
100 percent in 2007, 93 percent in 2010, 95 percent
in 2011, and 92 percent in 2013. Some facilities are
not able to provide all the information requested for
all juveniles meeting CJRP inclusion criteria. In such
cases, data are imputed from complete records to fill
in incomplete records. Therefore, reported CJRP
estimates regarding the characteristics of juveniles in
custody may differ from their actual characteristics.
To make data available to a wide variety of users, online
access to the CJRP is provided in the Easy Access to
the Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement
(EZACJRP) data analysis tool (http://www.ojjdp.
gov/ojstatbb/ezacjrp/), developed and maintained by
The National Center for Juvenile Justice (NCJJ) for
OJJDP. The EZACJRP data analysis tool allows users
to perform custom crosstabs of national data on the
characteristics of youth held in residential placement
facilities, including detailed information about the
youth’s age, sex, race/ethnicity, placement status,
length of stay, and most serious offense. By statute
and regulation, OJJDP must protect the privacy of
individuals included in its surveys. To comply with
this requirement, OJJDP has adopted a policy that
requires all published table cells to be rounded to
the nearest multiple of 3. The table cells are rounded
after the table has been produced from the underlying

data. Each cell is rounded independently, without
consideration of row or column totals. As a result, in
many state tables the internal cells will not add to the
marginal totals. Rates and percentages presented in
OJJDP publications and state-level tables presented in
the EZACJRP data analysis tool are based on rounded
totals. More detail on OJJDP’s privacy protection
policy is available in Disclosure Control in the Census
of Juveniles in Residential Placement, at http://www.
ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/ezacjrp/pdf/cjrpprot.pdf.
Individual years of data from the CJRP are also
available through the secure data enclave of the
Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social
Research (ICPSR) in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Access
to the data is arranged following a completed and
approved Application for Use of the ICPSR Data
Enclave. Analysis of these data is closely monitored
to protect confidentiality. Concatenated, multiyear
CJRP data are also available for online analysis
through remote access at ICPSR using the National
Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD) Restricted
Survey Documentation and Analysis (RSDA) system.
This system allows for the analysis of restricted-use
data without access to the microdata. Users interested
in accessing data through NACJD’s RSDA system
must complete an RSDA Data Use Agreement form
and specify the reasons for the request. More detail

Accuracy of Estimates
The accuracy of any statistic is determined by the joint
effects of nonsampling and sampling errors. Both
types of error affect the estimates presented in this
report. Several sources can contribute to nonsampling
errors. For example, members of the population of
interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling
frame; sampled members refuse to answer some of
the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of
the survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse);
mistakes are made during data editing, coding,
or entry; the responses that respondents provide
differ from the “true” responses; or measurement
instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail
to measure the characteristics they are intended
to measure. Although nonsampling errors due to

questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced
somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and
imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors
or gauging the effects of these errors is usually difficult.
Sampling errors occur because observations are
made on samples rather than on entire populations.
Surveys of population universes are not subject to
sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample will differ
somewhat from those that would have been obtained
by a complete census of the relevant population
using the same survey instruments, instructions,
and procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a
measure of the variation due to sampling; it indicates
the precision of the statistic obtained in a particular
sample. In addition, the standard errors for two sample
statistics can be used to estimate the precision of the
difference between the two statistics and to help
determine whether the difference based on the sample
is large enough so that it represents the population
difference.
Most of the data used in this report were obtained
from complex sampling designs rather than a simple
random design. The features of complex sampling
require different techniques to calculate standard errors
than are used for data collected using a simple random
sampling. Therefore, calculation of standard errors
requires procedures that are markedly different from
the ones used when the data are from a simple random
sample. The Taylor series approximation technique or
the balanced repeated replication (BRR) method was
used to estimate most of the statistics and their standard
errors in this report.
Standard error calculation for data from the School
Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series
approximation method using PSU and strata
variables available from each dataset. For statistics
based on all years of NCVS data, standard errors
were derived from a formula developed by the U.S.
Census Bureau, which consists of three generalized
variance function (gvf) constant parameters that
represent the curve fitted to the individual standard
errors calculated using the Jackknife Repeated
Replication technique.
The coefficient of variation (CV ) represents the ratio
of the standard error to the mean. As an attribute
of a distribution, the CV is an important measure of
the reliability and accuracy of an estimate. With the
exception of Indicator 2, the CV was calculated for
all estimates in this report, and in cases where the CV
was between 30 and 50 percent the estimates were
noted with a ! symbol (interpret data with caution).
In Indicator 2, the “!” symbol cautions the reader that
estimates marked indicate that the reported statistic
was based on fewer than 10 cases. With the exception
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2015

211

of Indicator 2, in cases where the CV was 50 percent
or greater, the estimate was determined not to meet
reporting standards and was suppressed.

Statistical Procedures
Comparisons in the text based on sample survey data
have been tested for statistical significance to ensure
that the differences are larger than might be expected
due to sampling variation. Findings described in this
report with comparative language (e.g., higher, lower,
increase, and decrease) are statistically significant at the
.05 level. Comparisons based on universe data do not
require statistical testing, with the exception of linear
trends. Several test procedures were used, depending
upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of
the statement being tested. The primary test procedure
used in this report was Student’s t statistic, which tests
the difference between two sample estimates. The t test
formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons.
The formula used to compute the t statistic is as follows:

t=

E1 - E2
√se12 + se 22

(1)

where E1 and E2 are the estimates to be compared
and se1 and se2 are their corresponding standard
errors. Note that this formula is valid only for
independent estimates. When the estimates are not
independent (for example, when comparing a total
percentage with that for a subgroup included in
the total), a covariance term (i.e., 2 * r * se1 * se2)
must be subtracted from the denominator of the
formula:

t=

E1 - E2
√se12 + se 22 - (2 * r * se1 * se2)

(2)

where r is the correlation coefficient. Once the t value
was computed, it was compared to the published tables
of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels.
For this report, an alpha value of .05 was used, which
has a t value of 1.96. If the t value was larger than
1.96, then the difference between the two estimates
is statistically significant at the 95 percent level.

212

Appendix A: Technical Notes

A linear trend test was used when differences among
percentages were examined relative to ordered
categories of a variable, rather than the differences
between two discrete categories. This test allows one
to examine whether, for example, the percentage
of students using drugs increased (or decreased)
over time or whether the percentage of students
who reported being physically attacked in school
increased (or decreased) with their age. Based on
a regression with, for example, student’s age as the
independent variable and whether a student was
physically attacked as the dependent variable, the
test involves computing the regression coefficient (b)
and its corresponding standard error (se). The ratio
of these two (b/se) is the test statistic t. If t is greater
than 1.96, the critical value for one comparison at
the .05 alpha level, the hypothesis that there is no
linear relationship between student’s age and being
physically attacked is rejected.
Some comparisons among categories of an ordered
variable with three or more levels involved a test for a
linear trend across all categories, rather than a series
of tests between pairs of categories. In this report,
when differences among percentages were examined
relative to a variable with ordered categories, analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear
relationship between the two variables. To do this,
ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts
corresponding to successive levels of the independent
variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors
(that is, standard errors that were calculated by the
Taylor series method), the variance between the
means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used
to partition the total sum of squares into within- and
between-group sums of squares. These were used to
create mean squares for the within- and betweengroup variance components and their corresponding
F statistics, which were then compared to published
values of F for a significance level of .05. Significant
values of both the overall F and the F associated with
the linear contrast term were required as evidence of
a linear relationship between the two variables.

Glossary of
Terms

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2015

213

General Terms
Crime Any violation of a statute or regulation or any
act that the government has determined is injurious
to the public, including felonies and misdemeanors.
Such violation may or may not involve violence, and
it may affect individuals or property.
Incident A specific criminal act or offense involving
one or more victims and one or more offenders.
Multistage sampling A survey sampling technique in
which there is more than one wave of sampling. That
is, one sample of units is drawn, and then another
sample is drawn within that sample. For example,
at the first stage, a number of Census blocks may be
sampled out of all the Census blocks in the United
States. At the second stage, households are sampled
within the previously sampled Census blocks.
Prevalence The percentage of the population directly
affected by crime in a given period. This rate is based
upon specific information elicited directly from the
respondent regarding crimes committed against his
or her person, against his or her property, or against
an individual bearing a unique relationship to him
or her. It is not based upon perceptions and beliefs
about, or reactions to, criminal acts.
School An education institution consisting of one or
more of grades K–12.
School crime Any criminal activity that is committed
on school property.
School year The 12-month period of time denoting
the beginning and ending dates for school accounting
purposes, usually from July 1 through June 30.
Stratification A survey sampling technique in
which the target population is divided into mutually
exclusive groups or strata based on some variable or
variables (e.g., metropolitan area) and sampling of
units occurs separately within each stratum.
Unequal probabilities A survey sampling technique
in which sampled units do not have the same
probability of selection into the sample. For example,
the investigator may oversample rural students in
order to increase the sample sizes of rural students.
Rural students would then be more likely than other
students to be sampled.

Specific Terms Used in Various Surveys
School-Associated Violent Deaths Study (SAVD)
Homicide An act involving a killing of one person by
another resulting from interpersonal violence.
Legal intervention death An act involving the
killing of one person by a law enforcement agent
in the course of arresting or attempting to arrest a
214

Appendix B: Glossary of Terms

lawbreaker, suppressing a disturbance, maintaining
order, or engaging in another legal action.
School-associated violent death A homicide or
suicide in which the fatal injury occurred on the
campus of a functioning elementary or secondary
school in the United States, while the victim was on
the way to or from regular sessions at such a school, or
while the victim was attending or traveling to or from
an official school-sponsored event. Victims included
nonstudents as well as students and staff members.
Suicide An act of taking one’s own life voluntarily
and intentionally.
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
Aggravated assault Attack or attempted attack with
a weapon, regardless of whether or not an injury
occurs, and attack without a weapon when serious
injury results.
At school (students) Inside the school building, on
school property (school parking area, play area, school
bus, etc.), or on the way to or from school.
Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) Geographic
entities defined by the U.S. Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for use by federal statistical
agencies in collecting, tabulating, and publishing
federal statistics.
Rape Forced sexual intercourse including both
psychological coercion as well as physical force.
Forced sexual intercourse means vaginal, anal, or
oral penetration by the offender(s). Includes attempts
and verbal threats of rape. This category also includes
incidents where the penetration is from a foreign
object, such as a bottle.
Robbery Completed or attempted theft, directly from
a person, of property or cash by force or threat of force,
with or without a weapon, and with or without injury.
Serious violent victimization Rape, sexual assault,
robbery, or aggravated assault.
Sexual assault A wide range of victimizations,
separate from rape or attempted rape. These crimes
include attacks or attempted attacks generally
involving unwanted sexual contact between the victim
and offender. Sexual assault may or may not involve
force and includes such things as grabbing or fondling.
Sexual assault also includes verbal threats.
Simple assault Attack without a weapon resulting
either in no injury, minor injury, or an undetermined
injury requiring less than 2 days of hospitalization.
Also includes attempted assault without a weapon.
Theft Completed or attempted theft of property or
cash without personal contact.

Victimization A crime as it affects one individual
person or household. For personal crimes, the number
of victimizations is equal to the number of victims
involved. The number of victimizations may be greater
than the number of incidents because more than one
person may be victimized during an incident.
Victimization rate A measure of the occurrence of
victimizations among a specific population group. For
personal crimes, the number of victimizations is equal
to the number of victims involved. Each victimization
that is reported by the respondents is counted, so
there may be one incident with two victims, which
would be counted as two victimizations. The number
of victimizations may be greater than the number
of incidents because more than one person may be
victimized during an incident.
Violent victimization Includes serious violent
victimization, rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated
assault, or simple assault.
School Crime Supplement (SCS)
At school In the school building, on school property,
on a school bus, or going to or from school.
Bullied Students were asked if any student had
bullied them at school in one or more ways during
the school year. Specifically, students were asked if
another student had made fun of them, called them
names, or insulted them; spread rumors about them;
threatened them with harm; pushed, shoved, tripped,
or spit on them; tried to make them to do something
they did not want to do; excluded them from activities
on purpose; or destroyed their property on purpose.
Cyber-bullied Students were asked if another student
did one or more of the following behaviors anywhere
that made them feel bad or were hurtful. Specifically,
students were asked about bullying by a peer that
occurred anywhere via electronic means, including the
Internet, e-mail, instant messaging, text messaging,
online gaming, and online communities.
Gang Street gangs, fighting gangs, crews, or something
else. Gangs may use common names, signs, symbols,
or colors. All gangs, whether or not they are involved
in violent or illegal activity, are included.
Hate-related graffiti Hate-related words or symbols
written in school classrooms, school bathrooms,
school hallways, or on the outside of the school
building.
Hate-related words Students were asked if anyone
called them an insulting or bad name at school having
to do with their race, religion, ethnic background
or national origin, disability, gender, or sexual
orientation.

Serious violent victimization Rape, sexual assault,
robbery, or aggravated assault.
Total victimization Combination of violent
victimization and theft. If a student reported an
incident of either type, he or she is counted as having
experienced any victimization. If the student reported
having experienced both, he or she is counted once
under “total victimization.”
Violent victimization Includes serious violent
victimization, rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated
assault, or simple assault.

Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS)
City A territory inside an urbanized area (defined as
densely settled “cores” with populations of 50,000 or
more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely
settled surrounding areas) and inside a principal city
(defined as a city that contains the primary population
and economic center of a metropolitan statistical area,
which, in turn, is defined as one or more contiguous
counties that have a “core” area with a large population
nucleus and adjacent communities that are highly
integrated economically or socially with the core).
Elementary teachers See instructional level.
Instructional level Teachers are divided into
elementary or secondary based on a combination of
the grades taught, main teaching assignment, and the
structure of their classes. Those with only ungraded
classes become elementary level teachers if their main
assignment is Early childhood/Pre-k or Elementary, or
they teach either special education in a self-contained
classroom or an elementary enrichment class. All
other teachers with ungraded classes are classified as
secondary level. Among teachers with regularly graded
classes, elementary level teachers generally teach
any of grades Pre-k–5; report an Early childhood/
Pre-k, Elementary, Self-contained special education,
or Elementary enrichment main assignment; or

guns, bombs, grenades, mines, rockets, missiles, pipe
bombs, or similar devices designed to explode and
capable of causing bodily harm or property damage.

Rural A territory outside any urbanized area (defined
as densely settled “cores” with populations of 50,000

as a city that contains the primary population and
economic center of a metropolitan statistical area,
which, in turn, is defined as one or more contiguous
counties that have a “core” area with a large population
nucleus and adjacent communities that are highly
integrated economically or socially with the core)
and inside an urbanized area (defined as densely

that occurred during normal school hours or when
school activities/events were in session.
City As collected by the Common Core of Data
and appended to the SSOCS data ﬁle, city includes
territories inside an urbanized area and inside a
principal city and includes large cities (populations
of 250,000 or more), midsize cities (population less
than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000)

Combined schools Schools that include all
combinations of grades, including K–12 schools,
other than primary, middle, and high schools (see
definitions for these school levels later in this section).

not lower than grade 9 and the highest grade is not
higher than grade 12.
Intimidation To frighten, compel, or deter by actual
or implied threats. It includes bullying and sexual
harassment. (Intimidation was not defined in the
front of the questionnaire in 2005–06.)
Middle school A school in which the lowest grade is

that inappropriately asserts sexuality over another
person. The behavior may be verbal or nonverbal.
Specialized school A school that is specifically for
students who were referred for disciplinary reasons.
The school may also have students who were referred
for other reasons. The school may be at the same
location as the respondent’s school.
Suburban As collected by the Common Core of
Data and appended to the SSOCS data ﬁle, suburban
includes territories outside a principal city and
inside an urbanized area and includes large suburbs
(populations of 250,000 or more), midsize suburbs
(population less than 250,000 and greater than or
equal to 100,000) and small suburbs (population less
than 100,000).

adjudicated delinquent and awaiting disposition
or placement elsewhere, or are awaiting transfer
to another jurisdiction.

temporary care similar to that of a detention center,
but in a physically unrestricting environment.
Includes runaway/homeless shelters and other
types of shelters.

focuses on providing some type of individually
planned treatment program for youth (substance
