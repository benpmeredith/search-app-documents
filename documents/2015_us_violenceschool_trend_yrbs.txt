National YRBS: 1991—2015
The national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) monitors priority health risk behaviors that contribute to the leading
causes of death, disability, and social problems among youth and adults in the United States. The national YRBS is
conducted every two years during the spring semester and provides data representative of 9th through 12th grade students
in public and private schools throughout the United States.
