(SCS) of the National Crime
Victimization Survey (NCVS).1 The Web Tables
show the extent to which students with different
personal characteristics report bullying and cyberbullying. Estimates include responses by student
characteristics: student sex, race/ethnicity, grade,
and household income. The U.S. Census Bureau
(Census) appended additional data from the
2010–11 Common Core of Data (CCD) and the
2011–12 Private School Universe Survey (PSS) to
generate tables showing the extent to which
bullying and cyber-bullying are reported by
students in schools with different characteristics.2
School characteristics examined are region; sector
(public or private); locale; level; enrollment size;
student-to-full-time-equivalent (FTE) teacher
ratio; percentage of combined American
Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Native
Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Black/African
American, Hispanic/Latino, and students of two or
more races; and percentage of students eligible
for free or reduced-priced lunch.
The SCS data tables show the relationship
between bullying and cyber-bullying victimization
and other crime-related variables, such as
reported presence of gangs, guns, drugs, and
alcohol, and hate-related graffiti at school;
selected school security measures; student
criminal victimization; and personal fear,
avoidance behaviors, fighting, and weapon
carrying at school.

The tables appear in four sections.
Section 1 is an overview table, showing the
number and percentage of students ages 12
through 18 who reported being bullied at school
and cyber-bullied anywhere, by type of bullying or
cyber-bullying (table 1.1).
Section 2 displays estimates for where in school
bullying occurred, the percentage distribution of
the frequency, and the type of bullying reported
by students ages 12 through 18, by selected
student and school characteristics (tables 2.1–
2.6).
Section 3 provides estimates for the percentage
distribution of the frequency and the type of
cyber-bullying reported by students ages 12
through 18, by selected student and school
characteristics (tables 3.1–3.4).
Section 4 displays the percentages of students
bullied at school or cyber-bullied anywhere by
student reports of unfavorable school conditions;
selected school security measures; criminal
victimization at school; and personal fear,
avoidance behaviors, fighting, and weapon
carrying at school (tables 4.1–4.4).

Data

The estimates presented in the tables originate
from the 2013 SCS to the NCVS. The SCS collects
information about student and school

These Web Tables were prepared for the National Center for Education Statistics
under Contract No. ED-IES-12D-0010/0004 with Synergy Enterprises, Incorporated (SEI).

characteristics related to criminal victimization on
a national level. The SCS was conducted in 1989,
1995, and biennially since 1999. Census selects
addresses for the NCVS using a stratified,
multistage cluster sampling design. Within the
sample, all persons in the household ages 12 and
older participate in the NCVS every 6 months (for
a total of seven interviews over a 3-year period) to
determine the extent of their victimization during
the 6 months preceding the interview.

http://nces.ed.gov/programs/crime. The final data
file is available in multiple software formats and
contains variables collected in the SCS and cleared
for release. Additionally, selected variables that
were collected in the NCVS Basic Screen
Questionnaire (NCVS-1) and NCVS Crime Incident
Report (NCVS-2) are appended to the SCS data
file.
The statistical programs used to calculate the
population estimates, percentages, and standard
errors for the Web Tables that include student
characteristics were SAS 9.3 and SAS-Callable
SUDAAN Release 11.0. The model applied in the
calculation of standard errors was the Taylor
series method with replacement and clustering
(NEST variables PSEUDOSTRATUM and SEUCODE).
The statistical program used by Census for the
tables that include school characteristics is SAS
9.2; since SAS does not handle extremely small
sample sizes when computing standard errors,
Census collapsed strata in SAS where necessary
for standard error calculations. The model applied
was the Taylor series method with replacement
using the cluster (variable SEUCODE) and strata
options (using a custom variable derived from
PSEUDOSTRATUM). Using different statistical
programs for the student and school characteristic
tables may result in differences in the rounded
estimates and standard errors between the two
types of tables.

The SCS is administered to all eligible NCVS
respondents ages 12 through 18 within NCVS
households between January and June of the year
of data collection. In 2013, approximately 53,152
sampled households were eligible to participate in
the NCVS, and those NCVS households included
9,552 members between the ages of 12 and 18.
To be eligible for the SCS, these 12- to 18-yearolds must complete the NCVS and meet certain
criteria specified in a set of SCS screening
questions. These criteria require students to be
currently enrolled in a primary or secondary
education program leading to a high school
diploma or enrolled sometime during the school
year of the interview; not enrolled in fifth grade or
under3; and not exclusively homeschooled during
the school year.4 To be included in the analysis for
this report, students had to be enrolled in grades
6 through 12, and could not have received any
part of their education through homeschooling
during the school year. In 2013, a total of 5,726
NCVS respondents were screened for the 2013
SCS, 5,008 met the criteria for completing the
survey, and 4,942 met the additional criteria for
inclusion in this report.5 Details about specific
variables used to define the report criteria appear
in the glossary.

Response rates

Because the SCS interview is conducted with
students after their households have responded
to the NCVS, the overall response rate for the SCS
reflects both the household interview response
rate (85.5 percent) and the student interview
response rate (60.0 percent). The overall
weighted SCS response rate (calculated by
multiplying the household unit response rate by
the student unit response rate) was 51.3 percent.
Furthermore, as in most surveys, some individuals
did not give a response to every item. However,
individual item response rates for the 2013 SCS
were high—the unweighted item response rates
for all respondents on all the 2013 SCS items
exceeded 85 percent. On the majority of items,
the response rate was 95 percent or higher. Some
items on the NCVS portion of the survey did have

Among newly sampled households, the NCVS/SCS
interview is administered face-to-face using
computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI).
Interviews with recurring households are
administered by telephone using CAPI.

estimates, as well as the SCS questionnaire, are

the public. Further information about the CCD is
available at http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/ and
information on the PSS is available at
http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/.

NCES requires that any stage of data collection
within a survey that has a base-weighted response
rate of less than 85 percent be evaluated for
nonresponse bias before the data or any analyses
are released. In the 2013 SCS, both unit and item
nonresponse bias analyses were performed. The
unit nonresponse bias analysis takes into account
nonresponses on both the NCVS and the SCS. For
the 2013 NCVS interview, Census found evidence
of unit nonresponse bias within Hispanic origin,
region, and age subgroups. Within the SCS portion
of the interview, only the age and region variables
showed significant unit nonresponse bias. Further
analysis indicated only the age 14 and the west
region categories showed response biases that
were significantly different from some of the
other categories within the age and region
variables. Based on the analysis, nonresponse bias
seems to have little impact on the SCS results.6

Missing data

When calculating column totals, readers should
note that there are several sources of missing
data. Among the 4,942 SCS students included in
the analysis, 4,836 (or 97.9 percent) were
matched to schools on the CCD or PSS files. The
remaining 106 students, who represent
approximately 542,000 students when sample
weights are applied, could not be matched to
schools and were excluded from the tables
showing school characteristics (tables 2.2, 2.4, 2.6,
3.2, and 3.4). Additional sources of missing data
should be considered when examining the row
variables. Student characteristic data on
household income contain some missing values
(18 percent), as do school characteristic data on
locale; level; enrollment size; student-to-FTE
teacher ratio; percentage of combined American
Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Native
Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Black/African
American, Hispanic/Latino, and two or more races
students; and percentage of students eligible for
free or reduced-price lunch. For these row
variables, Census provided percentages for the
additional missing school characteristic variables
(ranging from 10 to 20 percent), which were
calculated separately, but are not included in the
report tables.

Among the items included in this report,
household income was the only analysis variable
found to have a response rate of less than 85
percent. Reponses to this item are provided by
adult household members on the NCVS portion of
the survey. When comparing item respondents to
nonrespondents across race/ethnicity, sex, and
region, it was found that respondents differed
across race/ethnicity. White non-Hispanic
students had higher rates of response for the
income item than Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic,
and other students; therefore, readers should use
caution when interpreting results derived from
the household income variable.

Furthermore, across all tables, 33 student records
had missing bullying data and 38 student records
had missing cyber-bullying data. These students
were excluded from the analysis and represent a
total weighted number of about 183,000 students
with missing bullying data and 210,000 students
with missing cyber-bullying data. The total
weighted number of students with bullying data is
25,013,000, and the total weighted number of
students with cyber-bullying data is 24,985,000.
Due to the missing data, tables do not reflect the
total weighted student population (25,195,000).

Other data sources

The characteristics of the schools attended by SCS
respondents appear in tables 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 3.2, and
3.4. In the SCS interview, respondents provided
the school name, school location, and other
information that was linked to school data in the
2010–11 CCD or 2011–12 PSS. Census captured
the school characteristics from those external
datasets to produce the estimates. The school
information provided by the respondents and the
school characteristic variables are not available to

Respondents who were reported as being of Hispanic or Latino origin were classified as “Hispanic or Latino,” regardless of their race. “Black, not
Hispanic or Latino” includes African Americans. “All other races, not Hispanic or Latino” includes Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders, American
Indians or Alaska Natives, and respondents of two or more races (4 percent of all respondents).

The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 and, therefore, might not be representative of students in 6th grade. Comparisons
between students in 6th grade and those in other grades should be made with caution.

Caution should be used in interpreting analyses using the household income variable. Overall weighted item reponse rate for household income was
80.3 percent. The 19.7 percent of the respondents with missing data represent 4,558,000 students ages 12 to 18 whose household income is not explicitly
accounted for in the data.
NOTE: “Bullied” includes students being made fun of, called names, or insulted; being the subject of rumors; being threatened with harm; being pushed,
shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things they did not want to do; being excluded from activities on purpose; and having property
destroyed on purpose. “At school” includes the school building, school property, school bus, or going to and from school. Location totals may sum to more
than 100 percent because students could have been bullied in more than one location. Missing data are not shown for household income. Estimates are
reported for 25,013,000 students for whom data on bullying are available. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and missing data. Population
size for students ages 12–18 is 25,195,000.

The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 who were enrolled in grades 6–12 and, therefore, might not be representative of
students in primary schools. Comparisons between students in primary schools and those in other school levels should be made with caution.
2

Data on free or reduced-price lunch eligibility are only available for public schools.

NOTE: “Bullied” includes students being made fun of, called names, or insulted; being the subject of rumors; being threatened with harm; being
pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things they did not want to do; being excluded from activities on purpose; and having
property destroyed on purpose. “At school” includes the school building, school property, school bus, or going to and from school. Location totals may
sum to more than 100 percent because students could have been bullied in more than one location. Estimates for total bullied or not bullied are
reported for 25,013,000 students for whom data on bullying are available. Detailed estimates are reported for 24,471,000 students for whom data on
school and bullying are available. No school match was available for 542,000. Additional missing and not applicable school characteristic data are not
shown for locale; school level; enrollment size; student-to-FTE teacher ratio; percent of combined American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Native
Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and two or more races students; and percent of students eligible for free or
reduced-price lunch. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and these missing data. Population size for students ages 12–18 is 25,195,000.

‡ Reporting standards not met. The standard error for this estimate is equal to 50 percent or more of the estimate’s value.
1

Students who responded “don’t know” when asked about the frequency of bullying are treated as missing in calculating frequencies.

2

Injury includes bruises or swelling; cuts, scratches, or scrapes; black eye or bloody nose; teeth chipped or knocked out; broken bones or internal
injuries; knocked unconscious; or other injuries. Only students who reported they were pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on were asked if they suffered
injuries as a result of the incident.
3

Respondents who were reported as being of Hispanic or Latino origin were classified as “Hispanic or Latino” regardless of their race. “Black, not
Hispanic or Latino” includes African Americans. “All other races, not Hispanic or Latino” includes Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders,
American Indians or Alaska Natives, and respondents of two or more races (4 percent of all respondents).
4
The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 and, therefore, might not be representative of students in 6th grade.
Comparisons between students in 6th grade and those in other grades should be made with caution.
5

Caution should be used in interpreting analyses using the household income variable. Overall weighted item reponse rate for household income was
80.3 percent. The 19.7 percent of the respondents with missing data represent 4,558,000 students ages 12 to 18 whose household income is not
explicitly accounted for in the data.
NOTE: “Bullied” includes students being made fun of, called names, or insulted; being the subject of rumors; being threatened with harm; being
pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things they did not want to do; being excluded from activities on purpose; and having
property destroyed on purpose. “At school” includes the school building, school property, school bus, or going to and from school. Missing data are not
shown for household income. Estimates are reported for 25,013,000 students for whom data on bullying are available. Detail may not sum to totals
because of rounding and missing data. Population size for students ages 12–18 is 25,195,000.

Students who responded “don’t know” when asked about the frequency of bullying are treated as missing in calculating frequencies.

Injury includes bruises or swelling; cuts, scratches, or scrapes; black eye or bloody nose; teeth chipped or knocked out; broken bones or
internal injuries; knocked unconscious; or other injuries. Only students who reported they were pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on were asked
if they suffered injuries as a result of the incident.

3

The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 who were enrolled in grades 6–12 and, therefore, might not be
representative of students in primary schools. Comparisons between students in primary schools and those in other school levels should be
made with caution.

4

Data on free or reduced-price lunch eligibility are only available for public schools.

NOTE: “Bullied” includes students being made fun of, called names, or insulted; being the subject of rumors; being threatened with harm;
being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things they did not want to do; being excluded from activities on purpose;
and having property destroyed on purpose. “At school” includes the school building, school property, school bus, or going to and from school.
Estimates for total bullied or not bullied are reported for 25,013,000 students for whom data on bullying are available. Detailed estimates are
reported for 24,471,000 students for whom data on school and bullying are available. No school match was available for 542,000 students.
Additional missing and not applicable school characteristic data are not shown for locale; school level; enrollment size; student-to-FTE teacher
ratio; percent of combined American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Black/African American,
Hispanic/Latino, and two or more races students; and percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. Detail may not sum to totals
because of rounding and these missing data. Population size for students ages 12–18 is 25,195,000.

‡ Reporting standards not met. The standard error for this estimate is equal to 50 percent or more of the estimate’s value.

Respondents who were reported as being of Hispanic or Latino origin were classified as “Hispanic or Latino” regardless of their race. “Black, not Hispanic
or Latino” includes African Americans. “All other races, not Hispanic or Latino” includes Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders, American Indians or
Alaska Natives, and respondents of two or more races (4 percent of all respondents).
2
The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 and, therefore, might not be representative of students in 6th grade. Comparisons
between students in 6th grade and those in other grades should be made with caution.
3

Caution should be used in interpreting analyses using the household income variable. Overall weighted item reponse rate for household income was
80.3 percent. The 19.7 percent of the respondents with missing data represent 4,558,000 students ages 12 to 18 whose household income is not explicitly
accounted for in the data.
NOTE: “Bullied” includes students being made fun of, called names, or insulted; being the subject of rumors; being threatened with harm; being pushed,
shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things they did not want to do; being excluded from activities on purpose; and having property
destroyed on purpose. “At school” includes the school building, school property, school bus, or going to and from school. Bullying types may sum to more
than total because students could have experienced more than one type of bullying. Missing data are not shown for household income. Estimates are
reported for 25,013,000 students for whom data on bullying are available. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and missing data. Population
size for students ages 12–18 is 25,195,000.

The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 who were enrolled in grades 6–12 and, therefore, might not be representative of
students in primary schools. Comparisons between students in primary schools and those in other school levels should be made with caution.
2

Data on free or reduced-price lunch eligibility are only available for public schools.

NOTE: “Bullied” includes students being made fun of, called names, or insulted; being the subject of rumors; being threatened with harm; being pushed,
shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things they did not want to do; being excluded from activities on purpose; and having property
destroyed on purpose. “At school” includes the school building, school property, school bus, or going to and from school. Estimates for total bullied or not
bullied are reported for 25,013,000 students for whom data on bullying are available. Detailed estimates are reported for 24,471,000 students for whom data
on school and bullying are available. No school match was available for 542,000 students. Additional missing and not applicable school characteristic data are
not shown for locale; school level; enrollment size; student-to-FTE teacher ratio; percent of combined American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Native
Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and two or more races students; and percent of students eligible for free or reducedprice lunch. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and these missing data. Population size for students ages 12–18 is 25,195,000.

Respondents who were reported as being of Hispanic or Latino origin were classified as “Hispanic or Latino,” regardless of their race. “Black,
not Hispanic or Latino” includes African Americans. “All other races, not Hispanic or Latino” includes Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific
Islanders, American Indians or Alaska Natives, and respondents of two or more races (4 percent of all respondents).

The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 and, therefore, might not be representative of students in 6th grade.
Comparisons between students in 6th grade and those in other grades should be made with caution.
3
Caution should be used in interpreting analyses using the household income variable. Overall weighted item reponse rate for household
income was 80.3 percent. The 19.7 percent of the respondents with missing data represent 4,558,000 students ages 12 to 18 whose
household income is not explicitly accounted for in the data.
NOTE: “Cyber-bullied” includes having another student post hurtful information about the respondent on the Internet; purposely sharing
private information about the respondent by electronic means; make unwanted contact by threatening or insulting the respondent via e-mail,
instant messaging, text messaging, or online gaming; purposefully exclude the respondent from an online community; or purposely share
private information about the respondent on the Internet or mobile phones. This last description was added to the 2010–11 survey. Use
caution in comparing estimates of cyber-bullying to previous years. Missing data are not shown for household income. Estimates are reported
for 24,985,000 students for whom data on cyber-bullying are available. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and missing data.
Population size for students ages 12–18 is 25,195,000.

The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 who were enrolled in grades 6–12 and, therefore, might not be
representative of students in primary schools. Comparisons between students in primary schools and those in other school levels should
be made with caution.
2

Data on free or reduced-price lunch eligibility are only available for public schools.
NOTE: “Cyber-bullied” includes having another student post hurtful information about the respondent on the Internet; make unwanted
contact by threatening or insulting the respondent via e-mail, instant messaging, text messaging, or online gaming; purposefully exclude
the respondent from an online community; or purposely share private information about the respondent on the Internet or mobile phones.
This last description was added to the 2010–11 survey. Use caution in comparing estimates of cyber-bullying to previous years.
Estimates for total cyber-bullied or not cyber-bullied are reported for 24,985,000 students for whom data on cyber-bullying are available.
Detailed estimates are reported for 24,443,000 students for whom data on school and cyber-bullying are available. No school match was
available for 542,000 students. Additional missing and not applicable school characteristic data are not shown for locale; school level;
enrollment size; student-to-FTE teacher ratio; percent of combined American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific
Islander, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and two or more races students; and percent of students eligible for free or reducedprice lunch. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and missing data. Population size for students ages 12–18 is 25,195,000.

! Interpret data with caution. The standard error for this estimate is 30 to 50 percent of the estimate’s value.
‡ Reporting standards not met. The standard error for this estimate is equal to 50 percent or more of the estimate’s value.
1
Respondents who were reported as being of Hispanic or Latino origin were classified as “Hispanic or Latino,” regardless of their race. “Black, not Hispanic or Latino”
includes African Americans. “All other races, not Hispanic or Latino” includes Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders, American Indians or Alaska Natives, and
respondents of two or more races (4 percent of all respondents).
2

The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 and, therefore, might not be representative of students in 6th grade. Comparisons between
students in 6th grade and those in other grades should be made with caution.

3

Caution should be used in interpreting analyses using the household income variable. Overall weighted item reponse rate for household income was 80.3 percent. The
19.7 percent of the respondents with missing data represent 4,558,000 students ages 12 to 18 whose household income is not explicitly accounted for in the data.
NOTE: “Cyber-bullied” includes having another student post hurtful information about the respondent on the Internet; purposely sharing private information about the
respondent by electronic means; make unwanted contact by threatening or insulting the respondent via e-mail, instant messaging, text messaging, or online gaming;
purposefully exclude the respondent from an online community; or purposely share private information about the respondent on the Internet or mobile phones. This last
description was added to the 2010–11 survey. Use caution in comparing estimates of cyber-bullying to previous years. Cyber-bullying types may sum to more than total
because students could have experienced more than one type of cyber-bullying. Missing data are not shown for household income. Estimates are reported for
24,985,000 students for whom data on cyber-bullying are available. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and missing data. Population size for students
ages 12–18 is 25,195,000.

The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 who were enrolled in grades 6–12 and, therefore, might not be representative of students in primary
schools. Comparisons between students in primary schools and those in other school levels should be made with caution.

Data on free or reduced-price lunch eligibility are only available for public schools.

NOTE: “Cyber-bullied” includes having another student post hurtful information about the respondent on the Internet; purposely sharing private information about the
respondent by electronic means; make unwanted contact by threatening or insulting the respondent via e-mail, instant messaging, text messaging, or online gaming;
purposefully exclude the respondent from an online community; or purposely share private information about the respondent on the Internet or mobile phones. This last
description was added to the 2010–11 survey. Use caution in comparing estimates of cyber-bullying to previous years. Cyber-bullying types may sum to more than total
because students could have experienced more than one type of cyber-bullying. Estimates for total cyber-bullied or not cyber-bullied are reported for 24,985,000 students for
whom data on cyber-bullying are available. Detailed estimates are reported for 24,443,000 students for whom data on school and cyber-bullying are available. No school
match was available for 542,000 students. Additional missing and not applicable school characteristic data are not shown for locale; school level; enrollment size; student-toFTE teacher ratio; percent of combined American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and two or
more races students; and percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and missing data. Population size for
students ages 12–18 is 25,195,000.

Includes students who reported that marijuana, crack, other forms of cocaine, uppers, downers, LSD, PCP, heroin, prescription drugs
illegally obtained without a prescription, or other illegal drugs were available at school.
NOTE: “Bullied” includes students being made fun of, called names, or insulted; being the subject of rumors; being threatened with harm;
being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things they did not want to do; being excluded from activities on
purpose; and having property destroyed on purpose. “Cyber-bullied” includes having another student post hurtful information about the
respondent on the Internet; make unwanted contact by threatening or insulting the respondent via e-mail, instant messaging, text
messaging, or online gaming; purposefully exclude the respondent from an online community; or purposely share private information about
the respondent on the Internet or mobile phones. This last description was added to the 2010–11 survey. Use caution in comparing
estimates of cyber-bullying to previous years. “At school” includes the school building, school property, school bus, or going to and from
school. Estimates for bullied and not bullied students are reported for 25,013,000 students for whom data on bullying are available.
Estimates for cyber-bullied and not cyber-bullied students are reported for 24,985,000 students for whom data on cyber-bullying are
available. The population size for all students ages 12–18 is 25,195,000.

NOTE: “Bullied” includes students being made fun of, called names, or insulted; being the subject of rumors; being threatened with harm;
being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things they did not want to do; being excluded from activities on
purpose; and having property destroyed on purpose. “Cyber-bullied” includes having another student post hurtful information about the
respondent on the Internet; make unwanted contact by threatening or insulting the respondent via e-mail, instant messaging, text
messaging, or online gaming; purposefully exclude the respondent from an online community; or purposely share private information about
the respondent on the Internet or mobile phones. This last description was added to the 2010–11 survey. Use caution in comparing
estimates of cyber-bullying to previous years. “At school” includes the school building, school property, school bus, or going to and from
school. Estimates for bullied and not bullied students are reported for 25,013,000 students for whom data on bullying are available.
Estimates for cyber-bullied and not cyber-bullied students are reported for 24,985,000 students for whom data on cyber-bullying are
available. The population size for all students ages 12–18 is 25,195,000.

“Theft victimization” includes attempted and completed purse snatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed
thefts, excluding motor vehicle theft. Theft does not include robbery, in which the threat or use of force is involved.
3

“Violent victimization” includes rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault.
NOTE: “Bullied” includes students being made fun of, called names, or insulted; being the subject of rumors; being threatened with harm;
being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things they did not want to do; being excluded from activities on
purpose; and having property destroyed on purpose. “Cyber-bullied” includes having another student post hurtful information about the

estimates of cyber-bullying to previous years. "At school” includes the school building, school property, school bus, or going to and from
school. Student reports of “theft” and “violent victimization” may not sum to “Any victimization” because respondents can report more than
one type of victimization. Estimates for bullied and not bullied students are reported for 25,013,000 students for whom data on bullying are
available. Estimates for cyber-bullied and not cyber-bullied students are reported for 24,985,000 students for whom data on cyber-bullying

Glossary
All variables used in these tables appear in this glossary. The 2013 School Crime Supplement
(SCS) data file contains the variables used here, additional variables collected in the SCS
Questionnaire, and selected variables collected in the National Crime Victimization Survey
(NCVS) Basic Screen Questionnaire (NCVS-1) and NCVS Crime Incident Report (NCVS-2).
Records for all individuals ages 12 through 18 in NCVS households are included in the data
file. The SCS data file and questionnaire can be downloaded from the Inter-University
Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) via the Student Surveys link at NCES’s
Crime and Safety Surveys portal, located at http://nces.ed.gov/programs/crime/surveys.asp.
The NCVS questionnaires are also available through ICPSR.
Prior to analysis, the 2013 SCS data file was filtered to include only students who met all
criteria for this report: participated in an SCS interview (using SC004 [Type of SCS Interview]),
enrolled in school in the current school year (using SC006 [ATTEND SCHOOL THIS SCHOOL
YEAR]), enrolled in grades 6 through 12 (using SC008 [GRADE LEVEL IN SCHOOL]), and not
homeschooled during that time (using SC092 [HOMESCHOOLED]). Records in the data file
filtered out prior to the analyses came from 3,826 individuals who were not interviewed for
the SCS, and 784 students who did not meet the additional screening requirements listed
above. The final unweighted sample size is 4,942.
The U.S. Census Bureau (Census) produced the estimates appearing in tables 2.2, 2.4, 2.6,
3.2, and 3.4, which show the characteristics of schools attended by SCS respondents. The
tables include variables taken from the 2010–11 Common Core of Data (CCD) for public
schools and the 2011–12 Private School Universe Survey (PSS), which are not available in the
2013 SCS data file, but are included in the glossary as a reference.

Variables Taken From the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
Basic Screen Questionnaire (NCVS-1)
Household income (SC214)
Household income refers to income as reported by the head of household and was collapsed into the
following categories:
(1) Less than $7,500;
(2) $7,500–14,999;
(3) $15,000–24,999;
(4) $25,000–34,999;
(5) $35,000–49,999; and
(6) $50,000 or more.

G-1

Race/ethnicity, Hispanic origin (SC412R and SC413)
SC412R asked the head of household to identify the student’s race, and SC413 asked whether the student is
of Hispanic or Latino origin. Students who were identified as being of Hispanic or Latino origin were classified
as “Hispanic or Latino,” regardless of their race. Students who were not of Hispanic or Latino origin were
classified according to the race identified by the head of household (e.g., White, not Hispanic or Latino; Black,
not Hispanic or Latino; All other races, not Hispanic or Latino). Black, not Hispanic or Latino includes African
Americans. All other races, not Hispanic or Latino includes Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders,
American Indians or Alaska Natives, and individuals of two or more races (4 percent of all respondents).
Sex (SC407A)
SC407A indicates whether the student is male or female.
Type of victimization (TOCNEW_1 through TOCNEW_7)
Each SCS respondent reported as many as seven incidents of victimization in the NCVS-1 in 2013. For each
incident of victimization reported, an NCVS Crime Incident Report (NCVS-2) was completed. Data from
incident reports, along with a “type of crime” (TOC) code derived from NCVS-2 responses, were appended to
the SCS data file for each respondent who reported at least one victimization in the 6 months prior to the
survey. These seven TOC codes were used to construct the any, violent, and theft crime categories used in
these Web Tables. However, only incidents which occurred at school, or on the way to or from school, were
included in these Web Tables (see below). Therefore, the figures presented in the tables represent the
prevalence of such victimization at school.
Violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, simple assault with injury, assault
without a weapon and without injury, and verbal threat of assault. Theft includes attempted and completed
purse snatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, excluding motor vehicle
theft. Theft does not include robbery, in which the threat or use of force is involved. “Any” crimes include
one or more reports of any of the crimes listed above.

Variables Taken From the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
Crime Incident Report (NCVS-2)
Activity at time of incident (SC832)
Students were asked what they were doing at the time of the criminal victimization incident; specifically,
incidents included in these tables are those which students indicated had occurred while they were on their

School Characteristic Variable Appended From the 2010–11
Common Core of Data (CCD)
Enrollment size (MEMBER)
This variable contains the total number of students for all grades or the reported total membership of the
school.
Percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch
This is a created variable using two CCD variables. The total number of free and reduced-price lunch eligible
students (TOTFRL) is divided by the reported total membership of the school (MEMBER). The TOTFRL variable
may be calculated in the CCD as the sum of the number of free lunch eligible and the number of reducedprice lunch eligible students if the total is not reported.
Level (LEVEL)
This is the variable for school level. The following codes were calculated from the school’s corresponding
values for lowest and highest grades:
1 = Primary (low grade = PK through 03; high grade = PK through 08);
2 = Middle (low grade = 04 through 07; high grade = 04 through 09);
3 = High (low grade = 07 through 12; high grade = 12 only); and
4 = Other (any other configuration not falling within the above three categories, including ungraded).

urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is less than or equal to 2.5 miles from an
urban cluster.
42 = Rural, Distant Census-defined rural territory that is more than 5 miles but less than or
equal to 25 miles from an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is more than
2.5 miles but less than or equal to 10 miles from an urban cluster.

Percentage of combined American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander,
Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and two or more races students
This is a created variable and is the sum of the following: American Indian/Alaska Native students (AM),
Asian/Pacific Islander students (ASIAN), Black/African American students (BLACK), and Hispanic/Latino
students (HISP), divided by the reported total membership of the school (MEMBER). If the number of
American Indian/Alaska Native students was not reported, this field was calculated by summing the American
Indian/Alaska Native male (AMALM), female (AMALF), and unidentified (AMALU) fields; if the number of
Asian/Pacific Islander students was not reported, this field was calculated by summing the Asian/Pacific
Islander male (ASALM), female (ASALF), and unidentified (ASALU) fields; if the number of Black/African
American students was not reported, this field was calculated by summing the Black/African American male
(BLALM), female (BLALF), and unidentified (BLALU) fields; and if the number of Hispanic/Latino students was
not reported, this field was calculated by summing the Hispanic/Latino male (HIALM), female (HIALF), and
unidentified (HIALU) fields. Prior to the 2008–09 school year, NCES used five race/ethnicity categories, which
did not include the categories ‘Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander’ and ‘Two or more races.’ States had
the option of reporting based on the 5-category or the 7-category system until 2010–11. For more
information on this change, please refer to the October 19, 2007 Federal Register notice, Final Guidance from

Region
This is a created variable based on the two-letter U.S. Postal Service abbreviation of the state where the
school is located (LSTATE). The following regions were created based on the state in which the school was
located:
1 = Northeast (CT, ME, MA, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VT);
2 = Midwest (IL, IN, IA, KS, MI, MN, MO, NE, ND, OH, SD, WI);
3 = South (AL, AR, DE, DC, FL, GA, KY, LA, MD, MS, NC, OK, SC, TN, TX, VA, WV); and
4 = West (AK, AZ, CA, CO, HI, ID, MT, NV, NM, OR, UT, WA, WY).
Sector
This is a created variable to denote public or private school sector based on the source of the data. Data from
the CCD were coded as sector = 1 (public).
Student-to-full-time-equivalent (FTE) teacher ratio
This variable, which represents the student-to-FTE teacher ratio, is created from two CCD variables. The total student
membership of the school (MEMBER) is divided by the total full-time-equivalent classroom teachers (FTE). Full-time
equivalency is reported in the CCD to the nearest hundredth.

School Characteristic Variables Appended From the 2011–12
Private School Universe Survey (PSS)
Enrollment size (NUMSTUDS)
This variable represents the total number of students in the school.
Level
This is a created variable representing school level. The following categories were constructed using the
school’s corresponding values for lowest (LOGR2010) and highest (HIGR2010) grades:
1 = Primary (low grade = PK through 03; high grade = PK through 08);
2 = Middle (low grade = 04 through 07; high grade = 04 through 09);
3 = High (low grade = 07 through 12; high grade = 12 only); and
4 = Other (any other configuration not falling within the above three categories, including ungraded).
Locale
This is a created variable based on the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) urban-centric locale
code (ULOCALE).
1= City, which includes
11 = City, Large Territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with a
population of 250,000 or more.
12 = City, Mid-Size Territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with a
population less than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000.
13 = City, Small Territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with a
population less than 100,000;
2 = Suburb, which includes
21 = Suburb, Large Territory outside a principal city and inside an urbanized area with
population of 250,000 or more.

G-7

22 = Suburb, Mid-Size Territory outside a principal city and inside an urbanized area with a
population less than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000.
23 = Suburb, Small Territory outside a principal city and inside an urbanized area with a
population less than 100,000;
3 = Town, which includes
31 = Town, Fringe Territory inside an urban cluster that is less than or equal to 10 miles from
an urbanized area.
32 = Town, Distant Territory inside an urban cluster that is more than 10 miles and less than
or equal to 35 miles from an urbanized area.
33 = Town, Remote Territory inside an urban cluster that is more than 35 miles from an
urbanized area; and
4 = Rural, which includes
41 = Rural, Fringe Census-defined rural territory that is less than or equal to 5 miles from an
urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is less than or equal to 2.5 miles from
an urban cluster.
42 = Rural, Distant Census-defined rural territory that is more than 5 miles but less than or
equal to 25 miles from an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is more than
2.5 miles but less than or equal to 10 miles from an urban cluster.
43 = Rural, Remote Census-defined rural territory that is more than 25 miles from an
urbanized area and is also more than 10 miles from an urban cluster.
Percentage of combined American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander,
Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and two or more races students
This is a created variable that represents the sum of the percentages of Black/African American students
(P_BLACK), Hispanic/Latino students (P_HISP), Asian students (P_ASIAN), Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific
Islander students (P_ISLAND), American Indian/Alaska Native students (P_INDIAN), and students of two or
more races (P_TWO).
Region
This is a created variable based on the two-letter U.S. Postal Service abbreviation of the state where the
school is located (PL_STABB). The following regions were calculated based on the state in which the school
was located:
1 = Northeast (CT, ME, MA, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VT);
2 = Midwest (IL, IN, IA, KS, MI, MN, MO, NE, ND, OH, SD, WI);
3 = South (AL, AR, DE, DC, FL, GA, KY, LA, MD, MS, NC, OK, SC, TN, TX, VA, WV); and
4 = West (AK, AZ, CA, CO, HI, ID, MT, NV, NM, OR, UT, WA, WY).
Sector
This is a created variable to denote public or private school sector and religious affiliation if applicable. If a
student attends a school with data found in the CCD, sector = 1 (public school). If the school matches data in
the PSS, the school is private and additional variables are used to categorize the school. For variable P430
(“Does School Have Religious Orientation?” where 1 = Yes and 2 = No), those schools without a religious
orientation are assigned sector = 5 (nonsectarian). For those schools where P430 = 1, a second variable, P440
(the religious orientation or affiliation of the school) is recoded so that for schools that are Roman Catholic,
sector = 3, and for those schools that are otherwise religiously affiliated, sector = 4. Records that do not meet
any of the criteria for inclusion in the sub-categories (Catholic, Other religious, Nonsectarian) are coded as
sector=2 (private). As a result, the values of the religious affiliation subcategories in the report tables (sectors
3, 4 and 5) do not sum to the total value of the private school category (which includes sectors 2-5).
In summary, the coding for the sector variable is:
1 = Public school
2 = Private school, no religious affiliation data reported

3 = Private, Roman Catholic school
4 = Private, other religious school
5 = Private, nonsectarian school
Student-to-full-time-equivalent (FTE) teacher ratio
This is a created variable that provides the student-to-FTE teacher ratio. For schools found in the PSS, it is
calculated by dividing the total number of students in school (NUMSTUDS) by the number of K–12 teachers
(NUMTEACH), in estimated FTEs.
