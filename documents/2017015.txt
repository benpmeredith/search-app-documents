(SCS) to the National Crime
Victimization Survey (NCVS).1 The Web Tables
show the extent to which students with different
personal characteristics report being bullied.
Estimates include responses by student
characteristics: student sex, race/ethnicity, grade,
and household income. The U.S. Census Bureau
(Census) appended additional data from the
2013–14 Common Core of Data (CCD) and the
2013–14 Private School Universe Survey (PSS) to
the SCS to show the extent to which bullying
victimization is reported by students in schools
with different characteristics.2 School
characteristics appended to the file are region;
sector (public or private); locale; level; enrollment
size; student-to-full-time-equivalent (FTE) teacher
ratio; percentage of combined American
Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/ Native
Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Black/African
American, Hispanic/Latino, and students of Two or
more races; and percentage of students eligible
for free or reduced-priced lunch. Not all
respondents in the SCS data file could be matched
to a school in the CCD or the PSS.
The SCS data tables show the relationship
between reported bullying victimization and other
crime-related variables, such as reported
presence of gangs, guns, drugs, and alcohol, and
hate-related graffiti at school; selected school
security measures; student criminal victimization;
and personal fear, avoidance behaviors, fighting,
and weapon carrying at school.
These Web Tables were prepared for the National Center for Education Statistics
under Contract No. ED-IES-12D-0010/0004 with Synergy Enterprises, Incorporated (SEI).
Mention of trade names, commercial products, or organizations does not imply
endorsement by the U.S. Government. This Web Table Report was prepared by
Deborah Lessne and Christina Yanez of SEI.

The 2015 SCS included an embedded, randomized
split-half experiment to compare two versions of
an updated series of questions on bullying
victimization.3 The updated questions were
designed to collect additional data that align with
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and U.S. Department of Education’s uniform
definition of bullying released in 2013.4 To
maintain comparability with previous
administrations of the SCS, these Web Tables
include only data from respondents who received
Version 1 of the SCS. Version 1 used the same
question format for determining bullying
victimization as the 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011 and
2013 administrations. Analysis of the respondents
on both versions of the survey administered in
2015 indicates that the populations are similar
based on distributions for key variables, including
respondent age, sex, race, grade, and school
characteristics.
The tables are grouped into three sections.
Section 1 is an overview table, showing the
number and percentage of students ages 12
through 18 who reported being bullied at school
by type of bullying experienced (table 1.1).
Section 2 displays estimates for the reported
locations in school at which bullying victimization
occurred, and the percentage distribution of the
frequency, type, and impacts of bullying
victimization reported by students ages 12

through 18, by selected student and school
characteristics (tables 2.1–2.10).

specified in a set of SCS screening questions.
These criteria require students to be currently
enrolled in a primary or secondary education
program leading to a high school diploma or
enrolled sometime during the school year of the
interview; not enrolled in fifth grade or under5;
and not exclusively homeschooled during the
school year.6

Section 3 displays the percentages of students
who reported being bullied at school by student
reports of other unfavorable school conditions;
selected school security measures; criminal
victimization at school; and personal fear,
avoidance behaviors, fighting, and weapon
carrying at school (tables 3.1–3.4).

To be included in this report, additional criteria
were applied. Students had to be enrolled in
grades 6 through 12, and could not have received
any part of their education through
homeschooling during the school year.

Data

The estimates presented in the tables originate
from the 2015 SCS to the NCVS. The SCS collects
information about student and school
characteristics related to criminal victimization on
a national level. The SCS was conducted in 1989,
1995, and biennially since 1999 as a supplement
to the NCVS. Census selects addresses for the
NCVS using a stratified, multistage cluster
sampling design. Within the sample, all persons in
the household ages 12 and older participate in the
NCVS every 6 months (for a total of seven
interviews over a 3-year period) to determine the
extent of their victimization during the 6 months
preceding the interview.

In 2015, a total of 2,694 NCVS respondents were
screened for Version 1 of the 2015 SCS, 2,344 met
the criteria for completing the survey, and 2,317
met the additional criteria for inclusion in this
report.7 Details about specific variables used to
define the report criteria appear in the glossary.
All interviews for the 2015 NCVS/SCS are
administered using computer assisted
interviewing. Among newly sampled NCVS
households, the NCVS/SCS interview is
administered face-to-face while interviews with
recurring households are administered face-toface or by telephone.

Respondents complete the SCS after finishing the
NCVS basic questionnaire and crime incident
report. All NCVS respondents between the ages of
12 and 18 are eligible to complete the SCS. The
SCS is administered between January and June of
the year of data collection. In 2015, approximately
57,227 sampled households were eligible to
participate in the NCVS, and those NCVS
households included 9,372 members between the
ages of 12 and 18. The 2015 SCS was administered
in two different versions. Prior to administration,
households were randomly assigned to receive
one of two versions of the SCS survey. All
members of the same household received the
same version of the survey. Version 1 was
assigned to 4,663 household members, and
Version 2 was assigned to 4,709 household
members. Only household members who received
Version 1 of the survey are included in this report
so that estimates of bullying victimization are
comparable to previous years. After completing
the NCVS, the 12- to 18-year-olds in participating
households must also meet certain criteria

The survey data file used to produce the SCS
estimates, as well as the SCS questionnaire, are
available for download through the InterUniversity Consortium for Political and Social
Research (ICPSR) via the Student Surveys link at
the NCES Crime and Safety Surveys portal, located
at http://nces.ed.gov/programs/crime. The final
data file is available in multiple software formats
and contains variables collected in the SCS and
cleared for release. Additionally, selected
variables that were collected in the NCVS Basic
Screen Questionnaire (NCVS-1) and NCVS Crime
Incident Report (NCVS-2), and selected school
characteristics from the CCD or PSS are appended
to the SCS data file.
The statistical programs used to calculate the
population estimates, percentages, and standard
errors for the Web Tables were SAS 9.3 and SASCallable SUDAAN Release 11.0. The model applied

2

in the calculation of standard errors was the
Taylor series method with replacement and
clustering (NEST variables PSEUDOSTRATUM and
SEUCODE) using WEIGHT variable SCS PERSON
WEIGHT doubled for the analysis of only Version 1
respondents from the split sample administration.

Northeast had significantly lower response bias
estimates compared to other race and region
subgroups. Based on the analysis, Census
concluded that there are significant nonresponse
biases in the 2015 SCS data. Readers should use
caution when comparing responses among
subgroups in the SCS.

Response rates

Other data sources

Unit response rates were calculated by Census
using the full response population (those receiving
Version 1 and Version 2). Because the SCS
interview is conducted with students after their
households have responded to the NCVS, the unit
completion rate for the SCS reflects both the
household interview completion rate (82.5
percent) and the student interview completion
rate (57.8 percent). The overall weighted SCS unit
response rate (calculated by multiplying the
household completion rate by the student
completion rate) was 47.7 percent.

The characteristics of the schools attended by SCS
respondents appear in tables 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, and
2.10. In the SCS interview, respondents provided
the school name, school location, and other
information that was linked to school data in the
2013–14 CCD or 2013–14 PSS. Census captured
the school characteristics from those external
datasets and appended school characteristic
variables into the SCS data set. Further
information about the CCD is available at
http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/ and information on the
PSS is available at
http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/. Readers should
note that data are weighted to be representative
of youth ages 12 through 18 in U.S. households
only. School characteristics are not included in
the weighting process and estimates by school
characteristics are presented for descriptive
purposes only.

Furthermore, as in most surveys, some individuals
did not give a response to every item. However,
individual item response rates for the 2015 SCS
were high—the unweighted item response rates
for all Version 1 respondents on all items included
in this report exceeded 85 percent. On the
majority of items, the response rate was 95
percent or higher.

Missing data

When calculating column totals, readers should
note that there are several sources of missing
data. In the responses for Version 1, 33 student
records were missing responses on all subparts of
the bullying victimization indicator (SC134-SC140).
These students were excluded from all Web
Tables and represent a total weighted number of
about 379,000 students missing bullying
victimization information. The total weighted
number of students with bullying victimization
data is 24,243,000. Due to the missing data, table
details do not reflect the total weighted student
population of the Version 1 SCS (24,622,000).
Among the 2,284 SCS students included in the
bullying analysis, 2,203 (or 96.5 percent) were
matched to schools on the CCD or PSS files. The
remaining 81 students, who represent
approximately 859,000 students when sample
weights are applied, could not be matched to
schools and were excluded from the tables

NCES requires that any stage of data collection
within a survey that has a base-weighted response
rate of less than 85 percent be evaluated for
nonresponse bias before the data or any analyses
are released. For the 2015 SCS, Census completed
a unit nonresponse bias analysis.8 Respondents on
both versions of the survey were included in the
analysis. The unit nonresponse bias analysis takes
into account nonresponse on both the NCVS and
the SCS. For the 2015 NCVS interview, Census
found evidence of unit nonresponse bias within
Hispanic origin, urbanicity, region and age
subgroups. Within the SCS portion of the
interview, race, urbanicity, region and age
subgroups showed significant unit nonresponse
bias. Further analysis indicated that respondents
in the age 14 and the rural subgroups had
significantly higher nonresponse bias estimates
compared to other age and urbanicity subgroups,
while respondents who were Asian and from the

3

showing school characteristics (tables 2.2, 2.4, 2.6,
2.8, and 2.10). Additional sources of missing data
should be considered when examining the tables.
In the SCS data file, only student characteristic
variables taken from the NCVS (sex, race, income)
include edited and imputed values. All school
characteristic and student response variables may
have missing values which are not shown in these
tables.

Students in ungraded programs can complete
the SCS.
6 Persons who have dropped out of school, have
been expelled or suspended from school, or are
temporarily absent from school for any other
reason, such as illness or vacation, can complete
the SCS as long as they have attended school at
any time during the school year of the interview.
7 The 27 respondents who completed Version 1 of
the survey but did not meet the criteria for
inclusion in the report are 13 partially
homeschooled students, 5 students in ungraded
classrooms, and 9 students for whom grade was
missing.

1 Respondents who identified themselves as being of Hispanic or Latino origin were classified as “Hispanic or Latino,” regardless of their race. “Black, not
Hispanic or Latino” includes African Americans. “All other races, not Hispanic or Latino” includes Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders, American
Indians or Alaska Natives, and respondents of Two or more races (8 percent of all respondents).
2 The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 and, therefore, might not be representative of students in 6th grade. Comparisons
between students in 6th grade and those in other grades should be made with caution.
NOTE: Tabular data include only students who reported being enrolled in grades 6 through 12 and not receiving any of their education through
homeschooling during the school year reported. “Bullied” includes students who reported being made fun of, called names, or insulted; being the subject of
rumors; being threatened with harm; being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things they did not want to do; being excluded
from activities on purpose; and having property destroyed on purpose. “At school” includes the school building, school property, school bus, or going to
and from school. Location totals may sum to more than 100 percent because students could have been bullied in more than one location. Detail may not
sum to totals because of rounding and missing data. Total bullied and not bullied is based on respondents for whom data on bullying are available.
Population estimate based on Version 1 of the 2015 SCS for all students meeting the age, grade and school criteria is 24,622,000.

1
The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 who were enrolled in grades 6–12 and, therefore, might not be representative
of students in primary schools. Comparisons between students in primary schools and those in other school levels should be made with caution.
2
Data on free or reduced-price lunch eligibility are only available for public schools.
NOTE: Tabular data include only students who reported being enrolled in grades 6 through 12 and not receiving any of their education through
homeschooling during the school year reported. “Bullied” includes students who reported being made fun of, called names, or insulted; being the
subject of rumors; being threatened with harm; being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things they did not want to do;
being excluded from activities on purpose; and having property destroyed on purpose. “At school” includes the school building, school property,
school bus, or going to and from school. Location totals may sum to more than 100 percent because students could have been bullied in more than
one location. Total bullied and not bullied are reported for respondents for whom data on school and bullying are available. No school match was
available for 859,000 students. Additional missing and not applicable school characteristic data are not shown for locale; school level; enrollment
size; student to FTE teacher ratio; percent of combined American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Native, Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Black/African
American, Hispanic/Latino, and Two or more races students; and percent of students eligible for free or reduced price lunch. Detail may not sum to
totals because of rounding and these missing data. Population estimate based on Version 1 of the 2015 SCS for all students meeting the criteria the
age, grade and school criteria is 24,622,000.

Students who responded "don't know" when asked about the frequency of bullying are treated as missing in calculating frequencies.
2
Respondents who identified themselves as being of Hispanic or Latino origin were classified as “Hispanic or Latino” regardless of their race.
“Black, not Hispanic or Latino” includes African Americans. “All other races, not Hispanic or Latino” includes Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific
Islanders, American Indians or Alaska Natives, and respondents of Two or more races (8 percent of all respondents).
3
The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 and, therefore, might not be representative of students in 6th grade.
Comparisons between students in 6th grade and those in other grades should be made with caution.
NOTE: Tabular data include only students who reported being enrolled in grades 6 through 12 and not receiving any of their education through
homeschooling during the school year reported. “Bullied” includes students who reported being made fun of, called names, or insulted; being the
subject of rumors; being threatened with harm; being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things they did not want to do;
being excluded from activities on purpose; and having property destroyed on purpose. “At school” includes the school building, school property,
school bus, or going to and from school. Missing data are not shown for household income. Total bullied and not bullied is based on respondents
for whom data on bullying are available. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and missing data. Population estimate based on Version
1 of the 2015 SCS for all students meeting the age, grade and school criteria is 24,622,000.

1
Students who responded "don't know" when asked about the frequency of bullying are treated as missing in calculating frequencies.
2
The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 who were enrolled in grades 6–12 and, therefore, might not be
representative of students in primary schools. Comparisons between students in primary schools and those in other school levels should be
made with caution.
3
Data on free or reduced-price lunch eligibility are only available for public schools.
NOTE: Tabular data include only students who reported being enrolled in grades 6 through 12 and not receiving any of their education
through homeschooling during the school year reported. “Bullied” includes students who reported being made fun of, called names, or
insulted; being the subject of rumors; being threatened with harm; being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing
things they did not want to do; being excluded from activities on purpose; and having property destroyed on purpose. “At school” includes
the school building, school property, school bus, or going to and from school. Total bullied and not bullied are based on respondents for
whom data on school and bullying are available. No school match was available for 859,000 students. Additional missing and not
applicable school characteristic data are not shown for locale; school level; enrollment size; student to FTE teacher ratio; percent of
combined American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Native, Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and
Two or more races students; and percent of students eligible for free or reduced price lunch. Detail may not sum to totals because of
rounding and these missing data. Population estimate based on Version 1 of the 2015 SCS for all students meeting the age, grade and
school criteria is 24,622,000.

Respondents who identified themselves as being of Hispanic or Latino origin were classified as “Hispanic or Latino,” regardless of their race.
“Black, not Hispanic or Latino” includes African Americans. “All other races, not Hispanic or Latino” includes Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific
Islanders, American Indians or Alaska Natives, and respondents of two or more races (8 percent of all respondents).

The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 and, therefore, might not be representative of students in 6th grade.
Comparisons between students in 6th grade and those in other grades should be made with caution.
NOTE: Population estimate for all students meeting the criteria for inclusion based on Version 1 of the 2015 SCS in this table is “Bullied” includes
students who reported being made fun of, called names, or insulted; being the subject of rumors; being threatened with harm; being pushed,
shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things they did not want to do; being excluded from activities on purpose; and having
property destroyed on purpose. “At school” includes the school building, school property, school bus, or going to and from school. Bullying types
may sum to more than total because students could have experienced more than one type of bullying. Missing data are not shown for household
income. Total bullied and not bullied is based on respondents for whom data on bullying are available. Detail may not sum to totals because of
rounding and missing data. Population estimate based on Version 1 of the 2015 SCS for all students meeting the age, grade and school criteria is
24,622,000.

The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 who were enrolled in grades 6–12 and, therefore, might not be
representative of students in primary schools. Comparisons between students in primary schools and those in other school levels should be made
with caution.
2
Data on free or reduced-price lunch eligibility are only available for public schools.
NOTE: Tabular data include only students who reported being enrolled in grades 6 through 12 and not receiving any of their education through
homeschooling during the school year reported. “Bullied” includes students who reported being made fun of, called names, or insulted; being the
subject of rumors; being threatened with harm; being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things they did not want to do;
being excluded from activities on purpose; and having property destroyed on purpose. “At school” includes the school building, school property,
school bus, or going to and from school. Bullying types may sum to more than total because students could have experienced more than one type
of bullying. Total bullied and not bullied are reported for respondents for whom data on school and bullying are available. No school match was
available for 859,000 students. Additional missing and not applicable school characteristic data are not shown for locale; school level; enrollment
size; student to FTE teacher ratio; percent of combined American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Native, Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander,
Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and two or more races students; and percent of students eligible for free or reduced price lunch. Detail
may not sum to totals because of rounding and these missing data. Population estimate based on Version 1 of the 2015 SCS for all students
meeting the age, grade and school criteria is 24,622,000.

1
Includes students who reported being effected "somewhat" or "a lot".
2
Respondents who identified themselves as being of Hispanic or Latino origin were classified as “Hispanic or Latino,” regardless of their race.
“Black, not Hispanic or Latino” includes African Americans. “All other races, not Hispanic or Latino” includes Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific
Islanders, American Indians or Alaska Natives, and respondents of two or more races (8 percent of all respondents).
3
The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 and, therefore, might not be representative of students in 6th grade.
Comparisons between students in 6th grade and those in other grades should be made with caution.
NOTE: Tabular data include only students who reported being enrolled in grades 6 through 12 and not receiving any of their education through
homeschooling during the school year reported. “Bullied” includes students who reported being made fun of, called names, or insulted; being the
subject of rumors; being threatened with harm; being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things they did not want to do;
being excluded from activities on purpose; and having property destroyed on purpose. “At school” includes the school building, school property,
school bus, or going to and from school. Effect types may sum to more than total because students could have experienced more than one type of
effect. Missing data are not shown for household income. Total bullied and not bullied are reported based on respondents for whom data on
bullying are available. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and missing data. Population estimate based on Version 1 of the 2015
SCS for all students meeting the age, grade and school criteria is 24,622,000.

1
Includes students who reported being effected "somewhat" or "a lot".
2
The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 who were enrolled in grades 6–12 and, therefore, might not be
representative of students in primary schools. Comparisons between students in primary schools and those in other school levels should be
made with caution.
3
Data on free or reduced-price lunch eligibility are only available for public schools.
NOTE: Tabular data include only students who reported being enrolled in grades 6 through 12 and not receiving any of their education
through homeschooling during the school year reported. “Bullied” includes students who reported being made fun of, called names, or
insulted; being the subject of rumors; being threatened with harm; being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing
things they did not want to do; being excluded from activities on purpose; and having property destroyed on purpose. “At school” includes the
school building, school property, school bus, or going to and from school. Effect types may sum to more than total because students could
have experienced more than one type of effect. Total bullied and not bullied are based on respondents for whom data on school and bullying
are available. No school match was available for 859,000 students. Additional missing and not applicable school characteristic data are not
shown for locale; school level; enrollment size; student to FTE teacher ratio; percent of combined American Indian/Alaska Native,
Asian/Native, Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and two or more races students; and percent of
students eligible for free or reduced price lunch. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and these missing data. Population
estimate based on Version 1 of the 2015 SCS for all students meeting the age, grade and school criteria is 24,622,000.

Respondents who identified themselves as being of Hispanic or Latino origin were classified as “Hispanic or Latino,” regardless of their race.
“Black, not Hispanic or Latino” includes African Americans. “All other races, not Hispanic or Latino” includes Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific
Islanders, American Indians or Alaska Natives, and respondents of two or more races (4 percent of all respondents).

The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 and, therefore, might not be representative of students in 6th grade.
Comparisons between students in 6th grade and those in other grades should be made with caution.
NOTE: Tabular data include only students who reported being enrolled in grades 6 through 12 and not receiving any of their education through
homeschooling during the school year reported. “Bullied” includes students who reported being made fun of, called names, or insulted; being
the subject of rumors; being threatened with harm; being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things they did not
want to do; being excluded from activities on purpose; and having property destroyed on purpose. “At school” includes the school building,
school property, school bus, or going to and from school. Perceived relation may sum to more than total because students could have
perceived more than one type of relation. Missing data are not shown for household income. Total bullied and not bullied are based on
respondents for whom data on bullying are available. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and missing data. Population estimate
based on Version 1 of the 2015 SCS for all students meeting the age, grade and school criteria for is 24,622,000.

The School Crime Supplement sample includes students ages 12–18 who were enrolled in grades 6–12 and, therefore, might not be representative

Data on free or reduced-price lunch eligibility are only available for public schools.
NOTE: Tabular data include only students who reported being enrolled in grades 6 through 12 and not receiving any of their education through
homeschooling during the school year reported. “Bullied” includes students who reported being made fun of, called names, or insulted; being the
subject of rumors; being threatened with harm; being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things they did not want to do;
being excluded from activities on purpose; and having property destroyed on purpose. “At school” includes the school building, school property, school
bus, or going to and from school. Perceived relation may sum to more than total because students could have perceived more than one type of
relation. Total bullied and not bullied are reported for respondents for whom data on school and bullying are available. No school match was available
for 859,000 students. Additional missing and not applicable school characteristic data are not shown for locale; school level; enrollment size; student to
FTE teacher ratio; percent of combined American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Native, Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Black/African American,
Hispanic/Latino, and two or more races students; and percent of students eligible for free or reduced price lunch. Detail may not sum to totals because
of rounding and these missing data. Population estimate based on Version 1 of the 2015 SCS for all students meeting the age, grade and school
criteria is 24,622,000.

Glossary
All variables used in these tables appear in this glossary. The 2015 School Crime Supplement
(SCS) data file contains the variables used here, additional variables collected in the SCS
Questionnaire, and selected variables collected in the National Crime Victimization Survey
(NCVS) Basic Screen Questionnaire (NCVS-1) and NCVS Crime Incident Report (NCVS-2). The
SCS data file and questionnaire can be downloaded from the Inter-University Consortium for
Political and Social Research (ICPSR) via the Student Surveys link at NCES’s Crime and Safety
Surveys portal, located at http://nces.ed.gov/programs/crime/surveys.asp. The NCVS
questionnaires are also available through ICPSR.
The 2015 SCS data file includes records for 9,372 individuals in NCVS households between the
ages of 12 and 18. Prior to analysis, the data file was filtered to include only students who
met all the criteria for this report by selecting records using variable values:
• SC004 [Type of SCS interview] between 1-4 (completed the NCVS basic questionnaire
and participated in an SCS interview);
• SCSQTYPE2 [VERSION] = 1 (were administered Version 1 of the survey);
• SC006 [ATTEND SCHOOL THIS SCHOOL YEAR] = 1 (enrolled in school in the current
school year);
• SC008 [GRADE LEVEL IN SCHOOL] between 1-7 (enrolled in grades 6 through 12); and
• SC092 [HOMESCHOOLED] =2 (not homeschooled during this time).
Of the 9,372 records in the data file, 3,903 individuals were excluded from the analysis
because the student did not participate in an NCVS/SCS interview, 2,775 were excluded
because they were not given Version 1 of the survey, and 377 students were excluded
because they did not attend school, were not within the grade range, or were homeschooled
in the past year. The final unweighted sample size for the report is 2,317.
The estimates appearing in tables 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, and 2.10 show the characteristics of
schools attended by SCS respondents. These tables include variables taken from the 2013–14
Common Core of Data (CCD) and the 2013–14 Private School Universe Survey (PSS). An
additional 81 respondents not matched to any school in the CCD or the PSS are excluded from
these 5 tables.

Variables Taken From the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
Basic Screen Questionnaire (NCVS-1)
Household income (SC214A)
Household income (allocated) refers to income as reported by the head of household and was collapsed
into the following categories:
(1) Less than $7,500;
(2) $7,500–14,999;
(3) $15,000–24,999;
(4) $25,000–34,999;

G-1

(5) $35,000–49,999; and
(6) $50,000 or more.
2015 is the first year in which the allocated household income variable is included in the SCS data set. In previous
years, the household income item had a high rate of nonresponse; the allocated variable includes edited and
imputed values to minimize missing data.
Race/ethnicity, Hispanic origin (SC412R and SC413)
SC412R asked the head of household to identify the student’s race, and SC413 asked them whether the
student is of Hispanic or Latino origin. Students who were identified as being of Hispanic or Latino origin
were classified as “Hispanic or Latino,” regardless of their race. Students who were not of Hispanic or
Latino origin were classified according to the race identified by the head of household (e.g., White, not
Hispanic or Latino; Black, not Hispanic or Latino; All other races, not Hispanic or Latino). Black, not Hispanic
or Latino includes African Americans. All other races, not Hispanic or Latino includes Native Hawaiians or
Other Pacific Islanders, American Indians or Alaska Natives, and individuals of Two or more races (8 percent
of all respondents indicated Two or more races).
Sex (SC407A)
SC407A indicates whether the student is male or female.
Type of victimization (TOCNEW_1 through TOCNEW_5)
Each SCS respondent reported as many as five incidents of victimization in the NCVS-1 in 2015. For each
incident of victimization reported, an NCVS Crime Incident Report (NCVS-2) was completed. Data from
incident reports, along with a “type of crime” (TOC) code derived from NCVS-2 responses, were appended
to the SCS data file for each respondent who reported at least one incident of victimization in the 6 months
prior to the survey. These five TOC codes were used to construct the crime categories used in these Web
Tables: any, violent, and theft. However, only incidents which occurred at school, or on the way to or from
school, were included in these Web Tables (see below). Therefore, the figures presented in the tables
represent the prevalence of such victimization at school. Violent crimes include serious violent crimes
(rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault) and simple assault with injury, assault without a
weapon and without injury, and verbal threat of assault. Theft includes attempted and completed purse
snatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, excluding motor vehicle
theft. Theft does not include robbery, in which the threat or use of force is involved. “Any” crimes include
one or more reports of any of the crimes listed above.

Variables Taken From the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
Crime Incident Report (NCVS-2)
Activity at time of incident (SC832)
Students were asked what they were doing at the time of the criminal victimization incident. Prompts are
given until an activity can be coded; incidents included in these tables are those which students indicated
had occurred while they were on their way to or from school.
Location where incident occurred (SC616)
Students were asked where the criminal victimization incident occurred. Prompts are given until a location
can be coded. Incidents included in these tables are those which students indicated had occurred inside the
school building or on school property (school parking area, play area, school bus, etc.).

Variables Taken From the 2015 School Crime
Supplement (SCS-Version 1) to the NCVS
Adult notification (SC147)
Students were asked if they told a teacher or some other adult at school about being bullied.

Avoided a specific place at school (SC069-073)
Students were asked if they had stayed away from any of the following places because they thought
someone might attack or harm them: entrance to school (SC069), hallways or stairs (SC070), school
cafeteria (SC071), restrooms (SC072), and other places in school building (SC073). This is a created variable
where students who responded “yes” to one or more of these behaviors were included in the “avoided a
specific place at school” category.
Avoided school activities (SC078)
Students were asked if they had avoided any activities at school because they thought someone might
attack or harm them.
Bullied (SC134-SC140)
Students were asked if another student had bullied them at school during the school year, including made
fun of them, called them names, or insulted them (SC134); spread rumors about them (SC135); threatened
them with harm (SC136); pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on them (SC137); tried to make them do
something they did not want to do (SC138); excluded them from activities on purpose (SC139); or
destroyed their property on purpose (SC140). This is a created variable where students who responded
“yes” to one or more of these behaviors were included in the “bullied” category.
Carried a weapon
Students were asked if they had carried a weapon to school for protection during the school year. They
were asked about guns (SC082), knives brought as weapons (SC083), and other weapons (SC084). This is a
created variable where students who brought one or more of these to school were included in the “carried
a weapon” category.
Drugs at school
Students were asked about drug availability at their school. Drugs asked about were marijuana (SC041),
prescription drugs illegally obtained without a prescription (SC159), and other illegal drugs, such as cocaine,
uppers or heroine (SCS209). This is a created variable where students who responded “yes” to the
availability of any of these drugs were included in the “drugs available” category.

year.
Feared attack or harm
Students were asked how often they were afraid someone would attack or harm them at school (SC079) or
on the way to or from school (SC080). This is a created variable where students responding they were
afraid “sometimes” or “most of the time” were included in the “feared attack or harm” category.
Frequency of bullying (SC142)
Students were asked how often they were bullied during the school year.
Gangs present at school (SC058)

G-3

Hate-related Graffiti (SC066)
Students were asked whether or not during the school year they had “seen any hate-related words or

else inside the school building (SC146), outside on school grounds (SC144), on a school bus (SC145), in a
cafeteria or lunchroom at school (SC173), and online or by text (SC211SCS). Prior to 2013, the
“cafeteria/lunchroom” option was not a separate response option on the questionnaire, but was added to
the data set post-survey using the additional information provided when students responded that they
were bullied “somewhere else at school.”
Negative Effect Reported (SC196SCS-199SCS),
Students were asked about the extent to which they experienced negative effects due to being bullied.
Specifically, students were asked if bullying had a negative effect on their school work (SC196SCS), their
relationships with family and friends (SC197SCS), how they feel about themselves (SC198SCS), and their
physical health (SC199SCS) during the school year. In the tables, students responding they were affected
“somewhat” or “a lot” were counted as having experienced negative effects on each item.

harm them in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to or from school.
Staff supervision in hallways (SC029)
Students were asked whether there was hallway supervision by school staff or other adults at school to
ensure student safety.
Student code of conduct (SC096)

rumors about them (SC135); threatened them with harm (SC136); pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on them
(SC137); tried to make them do something they did not want to do (SC138); excluded them from activities
(SC139); or destroyed their property (SC140).
Version (SCSQTYPE2)
Students were randomly assigned one of two identical versions of the SCS that differed only for items
related to bullying victimization. Version 1 retains the historic formatting of the items on bullying
victimization with follow-up questions on repetition and power imbalance, while Version 2 contains a
single item with repetition and power imbalance included in the definition of bullying presented before
respondents are asked whether they have been bullied. A complete discussion of the split-half
methodology and results can be found at http:/nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017004.pdf.

School Characteristic Variables Appended to the 2015 School Crime
Supplement (Version-1) Data File From the 2013–14 Common Core of Data
(CCD) or the 2013–14 Private School Universe Survey (PSS)
Respondents supplied school identification information used to match records in either the 2013–14
Common Core of Data (CCD) or the 2013–14 Private School Universe Survey (PSS). Data from those files
were used to construct the variables below. The identifying information supplied by the respondents is not
included in the SCS files.
Enrollment size (SC218SCS)
This variable contains the total number of students for all grades or the reported total membership of the
school.
Level (SC217SCS)
This is the variable for school level. The following codes were calculated from the school’s corresponding
values for lowest and highest grades:
1 = Primary (low grade = PK through 03; high grade = PK through 08);
2 = Middle (low grade = 04 through 07; high grade = 04 through 09);
3 = High (low grade = 07 through 12; high grade = 12 only); and
4 = Other (any other configuration not falling within the above three categories, including
ungraded).
Percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (221SCS)
For public schools (CCD)
This is a created variable using two CCD variables. The total number of free and reduced-price lunch eligible
students (TOTFRL) is divided by the reported total membership of the school (MEMBER). The TOTFRL
variable may be calculated in the CCD as the sum of the number of free lunch eligible and the number of
reduced-price lunch eligible students if the total is not reported.
Private schools do not report free and reduced-price lunch eligible students in the 2013-2014 PSS.
Locale (SC216SCS)
This is a created variable based on the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) urban-centric locale
code (ULOCAL). (Note: An urbanized area is defined as an area that is a densely settled core with a
population concentration of at least 50,000. An urban cluster is defined as a component of a large
metropolitan area, greater than one million people, and contains a cluster of counties (cities and towns in
New England) that demonstrate very strong internal economic and social links, in addition to close ties to
other portions of the
larger area.)
1 = City, which includes

G-5

11 = City, Large Territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with a
population of 250,000 or more.
12 = City, Mid-Size Territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with a
population less than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000.
13 = City, Small Territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with a
population less than 100,000;
2 = Suburb, which includes
21 = Suburb, Large Territory outside a principal city and inside an urbanized area with a
population of 250,000 or more.
22 = Suburb, Mid-Size Territory outside a principal city and inside an urbanized area with a
population less than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000.
23 = Suburb, Small Territory outside a principal city and inside an urbanized area with a
population less than 100,000;
3 = Town, which includes
31 = Town, Fringe Territory inside an urban cluster that is less than or equal to 10 miles
from an urbanized area.
32 = Town, Distant Territory inside an urban cluster that is more than 10 miles and less
than or equal to 35 miles from an urbanized area.
33 = Town, Remote Territory inside an urban cluster that is more than 35 miles from an
urbanized area; and
4 = Rural, which includes
41 = Rural, Fringe Census-defined rural territory that is less than or equal to 5 miles from
an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is less than or equal to 2.5 miles
from an urban cluster.
42 = Rural, Distant Census-defined rural territory that is more than 5 miles but less than or
equal to 25 miles from an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is more than
2.5 miles but less than or equal to 10 miles from an urban cluster.
43 = Rural, Remote Census-defined rural territory that is more than 25 miles from an
urbanized area and is also more than 10 miles from an urban cluster.
Region (214SCS)
This is a variable based on the two-letter U.S. Postal Service abbreviation of the state where the school is
located. The following regions were created based on the state in which the school was located:
1 = Northeast (CT, ME, MA, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VT);
2 = Midwest (IL, IN, IA, KS, MI, MN, MO, NE, ND, OH, SD, WI);
3 = South (AL, AR, DE, DC, FL, GA, KY, LA, MD, MS, NC, OK, SC, TN, TX, VA, WV); and
4 = West (AK, AZ, CA, CO, HI, ID, MT, NV, NM, OR, UT, WA, WY).
Percentage of combined American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander,
Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and Two or more races students (SCS220)
For public schools (CCD)
This is a created variable and is the sum of the following: American Indian/Alaska Native students,
Asian/Pacific Islander students, Black/African American students and Hispanic/Latino students divided by
the reported total membership of the school. If the number of American Indian/Alaska Native students was
not reported, this field was calculated by summing the American Indian/Alaska Native male , female, and
unidentified fields; if the number of Asian/Pacific Islander students was not reported, this field was
calculated by summing the Asian/Pacific Islander male , female, and unidentified fields; if the number of
Black/African American students was not reported, this field was calculated by summing the Black/African
American male, female, and unidentified fields; and if the number of Hispanic/Latino students was not
reported, this field was calculated by summing the Hispanic/Latino male (HIALM), female (HIALF), and
unidentified fields. Prior to the 2008–09 school year, NCES used five race/ethnicity categories, which did
not include the categories ‘Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander’ and ‘Two or more races.’ States had the
option of reporting based on the 5-category or the 7-category system until 2010–11. For more information
on this change, please refer to the October 19, 2007 Federal Register notice, Final Guidance from the

G-6

Secretary on Maintaining, Collecting, and Reporting Racial and Ethnic Data to the U.S. Department of
Education, located at http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2007/pdf/E7-20613.pdf.
For private schools (PSS)
This is a created variable that represents the sum of the percentages of Black/African American students,
Hispanic/Latino students (P_HISP), Asian students, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander students,
American Indian/Alaska Native students (P_INDIAN), and students of Two or more races.
Sector ratio (SC215SCS)
This is a created variable to denote public or private school sector based on the source of the data. The
coding for the sector variable is:
1 = Public school
2 = Private school, no religious affiliation data reported
3 = Private, Roman Catholic school
4 = Private, other religious school
5 = Private, nonsectarian school
If a student attends a school with data found in the CCD, sector = 1 (public school). If the school matches
data in the PSS, the school is private and additional variables are used to categorize the school. For variable
P430 (“Does School Have Religious Orientation?” where 1 = Yes and 2 = No), those schools without a
religious orientation are assigned sector = 5 (nonsectarian). For those schools where P430 = 1, a second
variable, P440 (the religious orientation or affiliation of the school) is recoded so that for schools that are
Roman Catholic, sector = 3, and for those schools that are otherwise religiously affiliated, sector = 4.
Records that do not meet any of the criteria for inclusion in the sub-categories (Catholic, Other religious,
Nonsectarian) are coded as sector=2 (private). As a result, the values of the religious affiliation
subcategories in the report tables (sectors 3, 4 and 5) do not sum to the total value of the private school
category (which includes sectors 2-5).
Student-to-full-time-equivalent (FTE) teacher ratio (SC219SCS)
This is a created variable that provides the student-to-FTE teacher ratio. It is calculated by dividing the total
student membership of the school is divided by the total full-time-equivalent classroom teachers.
