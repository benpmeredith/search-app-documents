The 2001 School Crime Supplement, or SCS, is a supplemental series of questions asked of eligible National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) household members designed to gather information about school-related victimizations on a national level. What is the purpose of the SCS? The 2001 SCS was an effort to provide information about school-related victimizations on a national level so that policy makers as well as academic researchers, practitioners at the Federal, state, and local levels, and special interest groups who are concerned with crime in schools can make informed decisions concerning this issue. Who sponsors the 2001 SCS? The 2001 SCS was solely sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The 1995 and 1999 SCS were jointly sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the NCES. Also, during the first half of 1989, the BJS in conjunction with the National Institute of Justice sponsored the first supplement to the NCVS on school crime. Under what authority is the School Crime Supplement Conducted? Since the 2001 SCS was a supplement to the NCVS, which is sponsored by the BJS, the SCS was conducted under the authority of title 42, United States Code, section 3732. When was the 2001 School Crime Supplement conducted? The 2001 SCS was conducted as a supplement to the NCVS during a 6-month period, from January through June 2001. The 2001 SCS is the fourth of its kind conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The SCS was previously conducted as a supplement to the NCVS during the first six months of 1989, 1995, and 1999. Beginning with the 1999 survey, the SCS is conducted as a supplement to the NCVS every two years. The next SCS is scheduled for January through June 2003. Page 3 ELIGIBLE SCS RESPONDENTS Who is eligible for the SCS? Eligible respondents for the 2001 SCS were those household members in all NCVS households including first time in sample households, who: ! were between the ages of 12 and 181 AND ! had attended school at any time during the 6 months preceding the interview AND ! were enrolled in a school which would advance them towards the eventual receipt of a high school diploma. Persons who dropped out of school, who were expelled or suspended from school, or who were temporarily absent from school for any other reason, such as illness or vacation, were eligible for the survey as long as they were attending school at any time during the six months prior to the month of interview. Persons attending home school were also eligible but were only asked questions to determine if they were in a home schooling situation. It was deemed that the other questions in the supplement were not relevant to students attending home schools. Do SCS respondents complete the NCVS also? Yes. These persons were administered the supplemental questions only after their entire NCVS interview was completed. How many respondents were eligible to receive the 2001 SCS? Households in the NCVS sample from January through June 2001 contained 12,534 NCVS respondents eligible for the SCS supplement. What was the response rate for the 2001 SCS? Approximately 77 percent of the eligible respondents completed the SCS interview; the remaining 23 percent were noninterviews. 1 In 1989 and 1995, NCVS sample household members age 12-19 were eligible to receive the supplement. However, it was determined that most 19 year olds did not meet the eligibility criteria of being currently enrolled in a post-secondary school so the upper age range was lowered to 18 for the 1999 and 2001 SCS. Page 4 DATA COLLECTION What modes of data collection were used to administer the 2001 SCS questionnaire? For the NCVS and the SCS, two modes of data collection were used: paper-and-pencil interviewing (PAPI) and computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). In PAPI, households were interviewed in person or by phone. A Census Bureau interviewer either personally visited the sample address and conducted the interview using a paper SCS questionnaire or contacted the household by telephone from the interviewer's home and completed the paper questionnaire over the phone with eligible respondents. In CATI, the interview was conducted by an interviewer calling from a centralized telephone facility and used an automated version of the paper questionnaire, or instrument, to administer the supplement questions and record the respondent's answers. The Census Bureau has three centralized telephone facilities located in Hagerstown, Maryland; Tucson, Arizona; and Jeffersonville, Indiana. For the 2001 SCS, interviewing was conducted in the Hagerstown and Tuscon telephone centers (TCs) since the NCVS is conducted in only those two facilities. What percent of SCS interviews were collected using PAPI? CATI? PAPI was conducted in approximately 70 percent of the households and CATI was conducted in 30 percent of the NCVS eligible households. PAPI may be done by personal visit or by telephone.  Approximately 90 percent of all interviews are conducted by the telephone; the other 10 percent are conducted by personal visit. Were interviews conducted by self-response? Yes. For the most part, interviewers attempted to interview every eligible person in the household by self-response. Were proxy interviews conducted? Yes, there are limited situations in which a proxy interview was acceptable. The same rules applied to the SCS as for the NCVS with regards to proxy interviews. Proxy interviews are interviews conducted in which someone other than the intended household member, who is 18 years or older, answers the questions for another person in the household. For the SCS, household members between the ages of 12 and 18 were interviewed by self-response whenever possible. However, if the interview was a proxy for the NCVS, a proxy interview was accepted for the SCS. Who can serve as a proxy respondent? An eligible proxy respondent is a household member who is at least 18 years old, who is very knowledgeable about the proxy household member, and who has already completed his or her own NCVS interview by self-response. Two exceptions to the age requirement for a proxy respondent Page 5 are when the household╒s reference person or one of the other people who owns or rents the home is under 18 years of age, or when all household members are under 18 years of age. On very rare occasions, a nonhousehold member may serve as a proxy respondent. What circumstances warranted a proxy interview? Information was obtained about an individual household member by conducting a proxy interview only under the following circumstances: ! If a child was 12 or 13 years old, a self-response interview should have been obtained. However, if the parents refused to let the interviewer speak to the 12 or 13 year old, a proxy interview was conducted with the parent. ! If a household member between the ages of 12 and 18 was temporarily absent and not expected to return to the sample household at all during the entire interview period, a proxy interview was acceptable. ! If a household member was considered physically or mentally unable to answer the questions, the person must have been unable to be interviewed due to health problems or mental incompetence. This condition must have been continuous during the entire interview period and did not include colds or flu, drunkenness, drug use, or problems that might have been aggravated because the questions were upsetting. What about noninterviews? A noninterview was accepted for the SCS if : ! the respondent was an NCVS noninterview; ! the respondent was an NCVS interview but refused or was unavailable for the SCS interview; ! the respondent was physically or mentally unable to answer the questions and no proxy was available, or ! if an acceptable proxy respondent refused to give a proxy SCS interview. Interviewers were instructed to complete selected items on the SCS questionnaire to identify each type of noninterview. Page 6 How many noninterview persons were there for the 2001 SCS?. Of the 12,534 eligible respondents, there were 2,882 noninterview persons, or 23 percent of the eligible SCS sample. Was the SCS administered before or after the NCVS? The general interview sequence for the SCS was to ask all appropriate NCVS questions of an eligible household member and if eligible for the SCS, ask all appropriate SCS questions before proceeding to the next eligible household member. This was done to avoid impacting the responses to the NCVS. Is information provided by SCS respondents confidential? Yes. Strict confidentiality of individual respondent information is guaranteed by the BJS under title 42, United States Code, sections 3735 and 3789g, and by the Census Bureau under title 13, United States Code, section 9. Only Census Bureau employees sworn to preserve this confidentiality may see the completed questionnaires. SCS QUESTIONNAIRE Is the 2001 SCS questionnaire the same as the 1999 questionnaire? No, but they are similar. The BJS, the NCES, and the Census Bureau jointly designed the survey questionnaire. Some modifications were made to the 1999 questionnaire to form the 2001 SCS questionnaire. What differences exist between the 1999 and 2001 SCS questionnaires? The 2001 SCS added some new questions and changed the wording of some existing questions. A description of the changes to the 2001 SCS follows: Screen Questions ! The screen questions were redesigned and some new questions were added pertaining to respondents who were home schooled. The new questions were designed to collect information about respondents who were home schooled for part of the SCS reference period and to determine their public or private school grade-equivalent. School Environment ! In this section, the 2001 SCS asked about additional safety measures taken by schools not asked about in the 1999 SCS. Page 7 ! Separate questions were asked about the availability of specific types of uppers and downers at school rather than in one general question as was done in the 1999 SCS. ! Questions were added which asked the respondent if they knew of any student who used or sold drugs or alcohol while at school. Fighting, Bullying and Hate Behaviors ! The section entitle ╥Victimization, Bullying and Hate Crime,╙ was renamed to ╥Fighting, Bullying and Hate Behaviors.╙ ! New questions were added to determine if the respondent had been involved in one or more physical fights at school, and if so, how many times. ! A question was added about having feelings of rejection, being called names, or being excluded from activities caused by other students. ! A question was added to determine if students had experienced a "threat of attack╙ as a type of victimization. Avoidance ! A new question was added to ask respondents about their fear of a threatened attack by someone at school. Weapons ! A new question was added to determine if students could have gotten a loaded gun without adult supervision either at school or away from school. Gangs ! The introduction statement in the ╥Gangs╙ section was modified to better clarify to respondents the definition of a ╥gang╙. ! The question asking if any students at school belong to a gang was removed. ! The questions concerning the presence of gangs at school was reworded to ╥Are there any gangs at your school?╙ Page 8 Student Characteristics ! A new section entitled ╥Student Characteristics╙ was added to the 2001 SCS. This new section included a question about skipping class, the types of grades the respondent received, and whether the respondent planned on attending school after high school. Who developed the 2001 SCS CATI instrument? The Census Bureau developed the CATI (computer-assisted telephone interviewing) version of the 2001 SCS supplement. The instrument was essentially the same as the PAPI version and was a computer-assisted survey execution system (CASES) instrument. Since the Census Bureau discontinued its use of microCATI in which the 1999 SCS instrument was coded, a new SCS instrument was coded using CASES software for the 2001 SCS. Were the 2001 SCS questions tested before implementing them in a production environment? Most of the questions incorporated in this current supplement were administered in prior SCS surveys, and tested via focus groups and cognitive interviewing. However, because there were new and revised questions on the 2001 SCS, the Census Bureau conducted a small-scale cognitive test of the SCS questionnaire. Based upon the results of the testing, some minor modifications, mostly wording changes, were made to the questionnaire. What kind of questions were asked in the 2001 SCS? The final questionnaire consisted of six different sections. They included: ! Screen Questions - The first section contained the screen questions which were asked to determine if the respondent was eligible for the supplement. ! Environmental Questions - The second section contained the environmental questions that obtained selected information on the type of school, such as whether the school was private or public, grades taught, measures taken by the school to ensure the safety of students, and the availability of drugs in school. ! Fighting, Bullying and Hate Behaviors - The third section contained the victimization questions which identified or distinguished the nature and extent of the crimes. These questions were designed to elicit crimes that occurred only at school, that is, in the school building, on the school grounds, or on a school bus. ! Avoidance - The fourth section contained avoidance questions which identified the effect of fear of school crime on behavior. The avoidance questions were designed to determine if students stayed away from school or particular places at school for fear of being attacked Page 9 or harmed. Students were also asked if they avoided participating in extra-curricular activities at their school for fear that someone might attack or harm them. ! Weapons - The fifth section asked questions pertaining to weapons. The purpose of these questions was to determine accessability for students to obtain weapons and if students brought weapons to school for protection. ! Gangs -The sixth section contained questions relating to the presence of organized gangs at school and whether students came into contact with gangs or gang members at school. How long does it take to complete the SCS Interview? An average SCS interview takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. TRAINING Did interviewers receive special training to conduct the 2001 SCS? Yes. For PAPI and CATI interviewers, the Census Bureau developed separate manuals and self-studies. Training was in the form of a self-administered study guide. The self-study provided basic facts, general procedures, and instructions for conducting the SCS supplement. Classroom training, in which training is administered by an instructor using a verbatim guide in a classroom setting, was not conducted due to cost and time constraints. Additionally, interviewers were provided with an interviewing manual. The manual provided detailed information about the content and administration of the 2001 SCS, covering each item in the questionnaire and addressing concepts related to the SCS. The PAPI self-study and manual also addressed procedures for editing completed SCS questionnaires. Plans are to include the SCS as a permanent separate appendix in the NCVS Field Representative's Manual and CATI Interviewer's manual. Were there differences between the 1999 and 2001 SCS training materials? Aside from differences related to the content of the SCS, the practice exercise format used in the 1999 SCS training material, which provided questions and scenarios for interviewers to resolve, was also used in the 2001 SCS training material. The ╥practice exercise╙ format for the self-studies provided a reliable way to address new issues, concepts, and questions the interviewers would possibly encounter during the 2001 SCS interviewing. Was an interviewer debriefing conducted for the 2001 SCS? Yes. Every interviewer who worked on the SCS was asked to complete a debriefing questionnaire. The purpose of the debriefing questionnaire was to obtain the interviewer╒s and respondent╒s opinions and outlook of the SCS questionnaire, which will be used for further development of the SCS questionnaire. The results are documented in the attached memorandum (Attachment 1). For the 2001 SCS, a copy of the debriefing questionnaire was provided to the interviewers with the Page 10 training materials, so that interviewers were aware of the type of information that was being requested by the survey prior to starting their interviews. CHECK-IN What happened to the data after it was collected? For PAPI, interviewers edited the SCS questionnaires for completeness and accuracy before transmitting them to their respective Census Bureau regional office (RO). In the ROs, the forms were further edited for completeness and accuracy and then sent to the National Processing Center (NPC) in Jeffersonville, Indiana for check-in, clerical editing, and keying. The keyed files were then sent to Census Bureau headquarters for post data-collection processing. For CATI, completed cases were transmitted daily from the Tucson and Hagerstown TCs to headquarters for post data-collection processing. What was the PAPI check-in operation? The first step of the clerical edit was the manual check-in of the paper questionnaires. The check-in is a control function that ensures all shipments are received from each Census Bureau RO and that each shipment is complete. Twelve Census Bureau ROs are located throughout the United States. Each office is responsible for the data collection activities of a survey for a specific, well-defined area or territory. Data collection problems are often referred to the appropriate RO for resolution. A sample number/control number check was also performed to ensure that it was complete and within an acceptable range. The next step required a manual verification of any supplements that were marked as noninterviews. For the 2001 SCS, a new requirement was implemented during check-in of the SCS PAPI questionnaires. Clerical check-in staff were instructed to ensure that every NCVS person age 12-18 had an SCS form completed for them (either interview or noninterview). If not, the staff contacted the appropriate RO to request that an SCS form be completed and shipped to them. Once these functions were complete, the SCS forms were clerically edited. CLERICAL EDITING What was the purpose of the clerical edit? The main purpose of the SCS clerical edit was to locate and correct any interviewer errors made during PAPI data collection and, when possible, correct areas of respondent misunderstanding. Such errors could only be identified by clerical review of the data. Errors were corrected in an effort to improve the accuracy and quality of the data. Page 11 What did the clerical edit consist of for the 2001 SCS? The clerical edit was a step in the processing of the PAPI SCS forms following the check-in that examined the data for certain types of errors. Part of the clerical edit also involved the coding of school names reported in the SCS. Each page of the questionnaire was examined for those interviews conducted using PAPI. There was no clerical edit of the 2001 CATI SCS data except for the school coding operation. Clerical editing was deemed not necessary since edits were built into the CATI instrument and any data errors were corrected at the time of interviewing. Some of the edits performed are described below. For both PAPI and CATI, the editing and/or coding operations were 100 percent verified. This means that all work was checked for corrections. ! Numeric values should have been entered right justified. If the values were not right justified, they were deleted and entered in the right-most boxes. ! If the numeric value was written in alphas, the word(s) were deleted and the appropriate number was entered. For example, if in item 8 there was an entry of "seventh" or 7th, this entry would be deleted and "07" entered, right justified, in the appropriate boxes. ! In some cases a range might have been entered. If this was the case, the midpoint was calculated and the range was deleted, replacing it with the midpoint. ! Write-in entries in "Other-specify" categories were examined to determine if they could be reclassified into one of the precoded categories. ! If the interviewer made a notation that the respondent answered "Don't know," this category was marked, if one was provided. If no such category was provided, the note was deleted and the item left blank. ! If multiple entries were marked where only a single entry was acceptable, the lowest coded (first marked) box was accepted. If SCS forms failed the clerical edit and could not be resolved by NPC staff, they (along with any accompanying NCVS forms) were sent to headquarters staff for resolution during a "referral" process. All resolved SCS referrals and their accompanying NCVS forms were returned to the NPC. These, along with any NCVS forms that did not require referral were separated from the SCS forms and batched for questionnaire keying. The SCS interviews and noninterviews were separated and sorted into batches consisting of approximately 50 supplements each. Page 12 SCHOOL CODING What was the 2001 SCS School Coding? The 2001 SCS coding was performed to assign the state, county, and school code to entries of school name, and city, county and state in which the school the respondent attended is located. These write-in entries are in items 6a and 6b of the 2001 SCS. The Census Bureau created an automated School Name Lookup file which was used by Census Bureau editors to uniquely code the location and name of the school. The 2001 School Name Lookup File was created using two source files: the preliminary 1999-2000 Public School file which was obtained from the Census Bureau's Governments Division and the latest available version of a Private School File from the Consumer Expenditures Programming Branch at the Census Bureau. The Public School file was produced by the Governments Division within the Census Bureau using data collected from the Common Core of Data (CCD) School Non-fiscal Survey sponsored by the Department of Education. The Private School file was obtained from the Consumer Expenditures Programming Branch within the Demographic Surveys Division of the Census Bureau. Data on this file were obtained from the 1999-2000 Private School Survey sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics. What was the School Name Lookup File? The School Name Lookup File is a SAS data set containing selected variables from a merged Public/Private school file. This subset file contained school identification variables essential for the coding of the school entries. Using this file provided a quick way for the National Processing Center coders to search for state, county, and school codes for schools reported in Item 6a of the SCS. Once found in the lookup file, a unique 12-digit school code, a 5digit county code, and a 2-digit FIPS state code were assigned. If the school name entered could not be located on the lookup file, or if the editor was unsure as to which school code to assign because the information provided by the respondent was incomplete or missing, the case was referred to Census Bureau Headquarters for resolution. Prior to referring a case, coders also had the ability to contact schools if they could locate a telephone number. In some instances contacting a school to verify information about their name and location resulted in clarifying whether the school was the same as that entered in Item 6a. For unresolved cases, staff at Headquarters had available to them the School Coding Lookup File as well. These files were used to attempt to resolve all uncoded school names. In certain instances, school names were misspelled and once searched for using the correct name, were found on the school coding file. Headquarters staff also used the Internet yellow pages listings to locate school names and telephone numbers. Once found, Census Bureau staff were able to verify in some instances that a complete school name was not provided by the respondent, or that the school name changed. For these cases, Census Bureau staff were sometimes able to locate the school name and code on the lookup file. For other instances, Census Bureau staff contacted schools and Page 13 found that they were very recently built or created from the merging of two separate schools, which explained why they were not on the School Code Lookup File. What is the School Code? The School code is a code that uniquely identifies any school in the United States. The variables LEAID and SCHNO on the public school file were used to create a unique 12-digit school code for all schools listed on the file. The variable LEAID is a seven-digit agency code, with the first two digits being the FIPS state code. The variable SCHNO is a five-digit school code. The variable CNTRL_NO on the private school file was used to create a unique school code for all schools listed on the private school file. Since this variable was only eight digits in length, four digits were added to the beginning of the school code to make the length of the private school code consistent with the public school code. The first two digits of the private school code represents the FIPS state code. The second two digits are always zero. What were the results of the 2001 SCS School Coding? 8,601 cases required school coding. Of these, 8,374 or approximately 97 percent of the school name entries were successfully coded. The 1999 SCS also had a 97 percent coding success rate. The high consistent coding rate is attributable to using a version of the public and private school files updated with the latest information on schools as well as emphasizing to the interviewers the importance of collecting complete school name information. DATA KEYING How is the SCS data keyed? Upon completion of the clerical edit, coding, and verification, the questionnaires were transmitted to the Electronic Data Processing unit in Jeffersonville, Indiana for data keying. The questionnaire data were keyed on a key-to-disk device. For control and quality control purposes, work units of approximately 50 questionnaires each were keyed. Questionnaires with different sample designations (J20 and J21) were batched separately from each other and within each sample, interviews were batched separately from noninterviews. The two-digit sample designation code preceded by a "J" is the code assigned to the sample unit when it was selected for the NCVS sample. All SCS data were keyed using a fixed field format. For the NCVS, the data is usually keyed in a Source Code/Data format with each data field consisting of a three-digit source code and six digits of data. The data then goes through a conversion during computer processing to put it into a fixed field format. By keying the SCS data in a fixed field format, which is more difficult for the data keyers since every item in the questionnaire has to be keyed even if it does not contain an entry, a step was saved in later processing to reformat the data to a fixed location on the file. Because the data were keyed in a fixed field format, various field edits were performed on the data as it was being keyed to ensure that the record was keyed correctly. A quality control measure was employed to ensure an acceptable level of quality of keying. All keying was verified on a 100 Page 14 percent basis. Upon completion of keying and verification, the data for each work unit were read to tape and transmitted to Census Bureau Headquarters for computer processing. POST-DATA COLLECTION PROCESSING What did the computer processing consist of for the SCS? The computer processing involved multiple steps. One of the first steps was the merging of the SCS CATI answer files with the keyed questionnaire file. Prior to merging the two files, the CATI file was reformatted to the format of the questionnaire file. Following this, there was an NCVS/SCS match operation. What was the NCVS/SCS match operation? The next step of computer processing, the match operation, was the matching of the fully edited, unweighted NCVS data files for quarters 1 and 2, 2001 to the unedited, unweighted SCS quarterly data files. Only NCVS households with household members aged 12-18 were matched to the SCS file. The purpose of the match was to identify "unmatched records" at the household level using control number as the variable to match. These are records in which there was an NCVS household record with no matching SCS record or an SCS record with no matching NCVS record. Separate listings of the NCVS and SCS unmatched households were produced and the mismatches were clerically reviewed for resolution by Census Bureau staff. If an NCVS household matched to an SCS household, a subsequent match was conducted on person line number and age for each person within the household. Person line number and age mismatches were also clerically reviewed for resolution. What were the results of the match operation? In the majority of the person mismatched cases, the line number and the age discrepancies were corrected to agree with the NCVS. In a very small number of cases, the ages on the NCVS file, those that had been allocated during the regular editing of the NCVS data, were changed to agree with the ages on the SCS file. For these persons, the ages on the SCS file were considered correct. In addition, eligible persons on the NCVS file for which no SCS was administered were added to the SCS file as an SCS noninterview. The SCS records which did not match to an NCVS record were dropped from the file. The following is a count of the number of NCVS persons age 12-18 from January through June 2001, the number of SCS records received, the number of SCS persons that matched to an NCVS household/person, and the number of SCS records that were deleted (nonmatches). After the match operation, the NCVS and SCS files were merged and the post data collection processing of the SCS data was initiated. Page 15 January - June 2001 NCVS Persons 12-18 SCS Persons % SCS Matches to TOTAL eligible NCVS persons 12-18 Matches 12,534 12,534 Nonmatches 64 158 TOTAL 12,598 12,692 99.5% For the entire six month period, 64 NCVS persons age 12-18 did not match on line number and/or age to an SCS person record. 158 SCS persons did not match to an NCVS person, so these SCS records were deleted. Of these 158 SCS persons deleted, 46 PAPI cases were deleted due to their corresponding NCVS interview not being keyed. This problem occurred when keyers accidentally stapled the pages of the PAPI NCVS-1 questionnaire together that contained the person data for these respondents. This resulted in the NCVS data for these persons not being keyed, nor subsequently matched to the corresponding SCS data. As a result, these SCS records were deleted during the match operation. Of these 46 PAPI cases, 14 were SCS interviews and the remaining 32 cases were SCS noninterviews. How was the 2001 SCS data edited? For the 2001 SCS editing, a generalized edit system was used to perform computer edits. This system was first implemented with the processing of the 1999 SCS questionnaire. What is the "generalized edit system"? Generalized Edit Modules The generalized edits included within the Generalized Survey Data Processing System are designed to identify (not correct) response errors and compilation errors. The processing system is designed and developed around the concept of edit modularity. An edit module is comprised of a discrete process or group of processes (a single task), it is physically and operationally a separate component. An edit module accepts input in a pre-specified format, it performs a SINGLE task against the input, and produces output also in a pre-specified format. Each edit module performs a 'generalized' function. It is generalized in that it performs an identical singular task against any input provided and produces output based upon the impact of the process against the input data. The edit module is input independent and it performs identically regardless of the data item used as input. It does not treat any data item as inherently unique. These generalized modules read tables which provide the list of data items on which the generalized edit function is to be performed. These tables, or locations where the edit module are to be executed, are provided by the system user. Page 16 Modules can be grouped to form a 'class' of operations. The edit is an operational class, the modules within the class might be described as presence tests, range tests, skip-pattern tests, balance tests, consistency tests, etc. The system designer (generalized system user) determines which survey data items are included in the table for a given class of edits. A range test is an example of a module. It performs a single function against any data item used as input, it validates that the value of the data item is within a pre-specified range of values, where the range is provided by the survey designer (generalized system user) and is stored in a table. If the value of the data item is within the specified range it is considered valid, if it is outside the specified range it is invalid. Why are modularity and generalization important? Modularization is the key component to structured programming. Some of the advantages of structured programming are (1) a formalized system design; (2) expedient development of code; (3) reduction of coding errors; (4) portability of modules; (5) system design changes are more easily implemented; (6) the developed code is easier to navigate; and, (7) new modules are easily added to a system with little disruption of existing code. Generalization facilitates the incorporation of processing standards. A generalized module can be constructed based upon the knowledge of an 'expert'. The experts╒ procedure is embedded in the code. The module is designed to process any data inputs and is portable thus, can be used on multiple surveys - it becomes a standard. Once survey processing standards are widely implemented then the disparities across surveys of processing techniques and procedures will be minimized. New generalized edit modules can easily be added to the system. If a survey designer for a specific survey can specify a table driven algorithm, then that can be incorporated into the system. All that is required is that the specified edit operate identically across any data item used as input to the module. Hierarchical Processing Each observation is processed in a predetermined order based upon the logic of the tests performed. The observation record is NOT processed from data item 1 through data item n. It is processed in logical order based upon the sequence of specified tasks (modules). The ordering of predetermined tasks is predefined by the survey designer. The processing of operational classes and modules determines the order in which data items are processed. All specified (in a table) data items are processed through module 1 before proceeding to process all applicable data items by module number 2. However, the order in which data items are processed within a module does not need to begin with data item number 1 and proceed sequentially to the last data item. The survey designer determines the order in which the data items are processed by a module. Page 17 The system user has complete control of which generalized edits are executed against which class of observations. For example, the system user could execute a subset of range tests against all observations where age is 12 through 15. The system user can interactively activate and deactivate individual edit tests and can use where clauses to specify subsets of observations to be included in the execution of the edit routines. Sequential Processing The input data file is processed sequentially from beginning to end one observation at a time. The current observation is processed through the system as far as possible before processing begins on the next observation. Again, the system user can specify which observations are included in any execution of any edit routine or routines. What types of modules are included in the generalized edits for the 2001 SCS data? Currently, the Generalized Survey Data Processing System includes a battery of generalized edit modules. The following modules were used for editing the 2001 SCS data: Required Data Item Test The purpose of this test was to validate that data items that must be present were in fact present, evidenced by the fact that the data item did not contain the missing value code (.) as the data value. Required data items are those data items which MUST be completed by ALL respondents. If a required data item contains a missing value, there is an error. Note, that many data items are conditionally required, that is required based upon a previous skip instruction. These types of required data items are not to be validated by this test. Conditional required data items are tested via the skip instruction edits. Range Test The purpose of this edit test was to validate that the data values present were within tolerance for the given data item. If the data value was either too large or too small, then the data item was identified as in error. Range tests are typically only performed against continuous data items, not against discrete data items. All data can be typed as either character or numeric. The generalized edit modules currently included within the generalized system operate against only numeric data. Numeric data can be further classified as either discrete, or continuous. Continuous numeric data items can assume any real (floating point) numeric value within a given range. For example, a continuous data item may exhibit data values from 0 through 100. Included within in this range would be all integer values (i.e. 1, 2, 3 ... 100), AND all real values (i.e. 1.1, 1.2, etc.). Dollar value entries are continuous, as are most scientific measurements. Page 18 Discrete data items only allow distinct data values. These discrete data items include only a predetermined list of possible data values (i.e. 1, 2, 3, and 4). The check box entries included in most Census Surveys are discrete data items, as they can assume only a distinct number of predefined data values. In general, range tests are performed on continuous data items and list-directed edits are performed on discrete data items. This edit verifies that the specified data item has a value that is both greater than or equal to the specified minimum value and less than or equal to the specified maximum value. A missing value code is assumed to be an acceptable data value. The system user provides a minimum and maximum value for each data item tested by the range edit. Note, that the specified inclusive range includes all values that would be found on a number line segment bounded by the two specified values (minimum and maximum). Thus, real numbers are considered valid. Skip Pattern Validation Tests The purpose of the Skip Pattern Validation Tests was to determine if the data values of skip items were consistent with the skip instructions as given on the questionnaire. These edits are often referred to as ╥consistency tests.╙ A skip instruction qualifies a respondent to provide information on a topic covered within a survey. The skip instruction ascertains if the respondent exhibited a behavior encompassed by the specific survey subsection. If the respondent positively indicates that the behavior covered in the survey subsection is germane then additional questions are asked of the respondent. If the skip instruction determines that the subsection is not germane then the subsection is skipped. Note, that skip instructions often do not simply receive yes or no responses. Often the responses to skip instructions are more involved and may include a wider range of permissible responses. List Directed Edits The purpose of a list directed edit was to validate that the data value for a specified data item exactly matched one of the data values on a specified list. The list contained all the valid data values that the specified data item could assume and be considered to be valid. If the specified data items' data value was not contained on the list then that data item was invalid. Survey Rules Validation The purpose of these tests were to validate COMPLEX inter-item relationships within an observation. These tests determine if the specified relationships between data items are true. If the statement is false then there is an error situation. These tests validate that expressions are valid, not that individual data items are valid. The tests validate an inter-item relationship, which is mathematical or logical. If the relationship is false then either the left hand side or the right hand of the expression is in error. The system cannot determine the cause of the error, as the relationship is in error not the individual data items. The algorithms for survey rules validation are provided as expressions. These expressions are saved in an external file and are read and executed in sequential order. If the expression is true (if Page 19 the mathematical or conditional statement is valid) then there is an error situation. If the expression is false then there is no error situation. Blanking Edit After the generalized edit modules were complete, the data were passed through a blanking edit. This edit checked to make sure that the case followed the appropriate skip pattern by stepping sequentially through the items. It deleted entries that should not have been filled. An "out-of-universe" code was assigned to all items that failed the edit. The "out-of-universe" code assigned to items that should have been blank consist of a "9" in each position of the multiple field for that item. For example, item 2 should be blank when the response in item 1 is "no". On the data file, the value in item 2 would be "99". What is the advantage of using the generalized editing system? Using the generalized system reduced the processing time because to development of separate formal edit specifications for each separate stage in the post-data collection processing is eliminated. The generalized editing program also allows for the quick and easy creation of edits via modules and allows an analyst to produce reports of summary editing results. WEIGHTING How was the SCS data Weighted? After all editing was completed, the weighting process began. Modifications to the regular NCVS weighting program were necessary in order for the weighting of the SCS file. The NCVS data had to be weighted twice: once including continuing rotations only and once including all rotations (incoming and continuing rotations). Incoming rotations are those households in which it is the first time we are conducting an NCVS interview. Continuing rotations are those households that have been interviewed before and are now in the next enumeration period. Modified weighting procedures were necessary because of the following differences between SCS and NCVS: ! The eligible population for SCS differs from the eligible population for NCVS. ! A person can respond to the NCVS and not the SCS. ! For select SCS items, the incoming rotation (first time interview) contributes to the estimates as well as continuing rotations. For the NCVS, only continuing rotations contribute to the estimates. Households in the incoming rotation (first time interviews) are not included in the NCVS estimates since the data for these cases are "unbounded". The purpose of the initial interview is for purposes of bounding, that is, to learn about all crimes occurring previously in order to keep the respondent from reporting them in subsequent interviews. Data obtained in the initial interview are, therefore, not used for computing NCVS victimization estimates. Page 20 In the NCVS weighting process, adjustments were made to account for both household and person noninterviews. Additional adjustment factors were applied to reduce the variance of the estimate by correcting for differences between the distribution of the sample by age, race, and sex and the distribution of the population by these characteristics. This also reduced the bias due to under coverage of various portions of the population. Weights were assigned to all interviewed households on the file and, within the household, to all interviewed persons. A special weighting adjustment was performed on the SCS data. Noninterview adjustment factors were computed to adjust the weighting for SCS noninterviews. Two SCS person weights were computed as a result of applying special adjustment factors to the NCVS final person weight. ! The first SCS weight computed was derived using the final NCVS person weight that was calculated for all interviewed persons in interviewed continuing households and applying a within-SCS noninterview adjustment factor. This weight, which should be used if producing NCVS estimates using only the continuing rotations, is located in the NCVS section of the NCVS/SCS person record. ! The second SCS weight was derived using the final NCVS person weight that was calculated for all interviewed persons in interviewed continuing and incoming households with a within-SCS noninterview adjustment factor applied. This weight, which should be used if producing SCS estimates using all rotations, is located in the SCS section of the NCVS/SCS person record. PUBLIC USE FILE CREATION Once all computer processing and weighting was completed, a 6-month NCVS/SCS public use file was created. ! Record type 001, which is the address record and consists of limited information about the household. ! Record type 002 contains the entire NCVS household record. ! Record type 003 contains the entire NCVS person record which was expanded from the 1999 SCS, to include the 2001 SCS information. ! Record type 004 contains the entire incident record information for up to 7 incidents. The file contained one record for each SCS eligible household member (age 12-18) with an expanded incident record to include information for all NCVS incidents reported by that person in the same record. To determine the number of incidents to allow for in this expanded incident record frequencies of incidents reported for SCS persons during the 2001 SCS were prepared. Based on the frequencies the maximum number of incidents reported by an SCS person during January through June 2001 was 7. To accommodate this information in one record the incident record type 004 was expanded to allow for 7 incidents. Page 21 How was the 2001 SCS public use file prepared? Prior to its release, the file was reviewed by the Census Bureau's Disclosure Review Board (DRB) to ensure that the contents of the file did not violate any disclosure avoidance measures. For confidentiality protection of the public use file, recoding procedures and a control number scrambling routine were performed before the file was released for public use. When creating the 2001 NCVS/SCS file a control number scrambling routine that was different from the NCVS control number scrambling routine was used to prevent matching the two files. In addition, data that may have provided geographic information by inference were blanked because of data confidentiality reasons. Although the school attended was uniquely coded, the DRB mandated that this code be suppressed to avoid disclosure of information about any one individual. What was the file format? The file was prepared on CD-ROM. Who was responsible for analyzing the results of the SCS? The BJS and the NCES were responsible for statistical analysis and publication of the data from the 2001 SCS. Page 22 VARIABLE DESCRIPTION LIST For Household and Person Variables Var Description Location V1 SAMPLE NUMBER 1-2 V2 SCRAMBLED CONTROL NUMBER 3-16 V3 HOUSEHOLD NUMBER 17-17 V4 PANEL OR ROTATION GROUP 18-19 V5 YEAR AND QUARTER 20-22 V6 UNIT STATUS 23-23 V7 HOUSEHOLD STATUS 24-24 V8 LINE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLD RESPONDENT 25-26 V9 SPECIAL PLACE/GROUP QUARTERS TYPE CODE 27-28 V10 TENURE (ORIGINAL) 29-29 V11 TENURE (ALLOCATED) 30-30 V12 LAND USE (ORIGINAL) 31-31 V13 LAND USE (ALLOCATED) 32-32 V14 FARM SALES (ORIGINAL) 33-33 V15 FARM SALES (ALLOCATED) 34-34 V16 TYPE OF LIVING QUARTERS (ORIGINAL) 35-36 V17 TYPE OF LIVING QUARTERS (ALLOCATED) 37-38 V18 LOCATION OF PHONE 39-39 V19 IS PHONE INTERVIEW ACCEPTABLE?

Each incident contains 523 variables which repeat seven times. In the codebook body, only the variable name of the first occurrence of an item (i.e., in the first incident) is listed. A complete list of variables that correspond to each other across incidents is listed below. If, for example, the user wishes to see the question text or review the coding of variable V1881 (4: LINE NUMBER OF RESPONDENT), the user should refer to the codebook for the first occurrence of this variable: V312 (1: LINE NUMBER OF RESPONDENT) in column location 475-476. The Census Bureau has listed two important variables, V831: Was it in your school? (source code 628) and V832: In what part of the building did it happen? (source code 629), at the end of the incident variables. These variables are new to the NCVS. They were added to the end of the incident variables in order to preserve the record layout of other variables. These two variables go with variable V341: How did the offender (get in/try to get in)? (source code627). Var Description Location V312 1: LINE NUMBER OF RESPONDENT 475-476 V835 2: LINE NUMBER OF RESPONDENT 1090-1091 V1358 3: LINE NUMBER OF RESPONDENT 1705-1706 V1881 4: LINE NUMBER OF RESPONDENT 2320-2321 V2404 5: LINE NUMBER OF RESPONDENT 2935-2936 V2927 6: LINE NUMBER OF RESPONDENT 3550-3551 V3450 7: LINE NUMBER OF RESPONDENT 4165-4166 V313 1: INCIDENT REPORTED-SCREEN QUESTION NO. 477-478 V836 2: INCIDENT REPORTED-SCREEN QUESTION NO. 1092-1093 V1359 3: INCIDENT REPORTED-SCREEN QUESTION NO. 1707-1708 V1882 4: INCIDENT REPORTED-SCREEN QUESTION NO. 2322-2323 V2405 5: INCIDENT REPORTED-SCREEN QUESTION NO. 2937-2938 V2928 6: INCIDENT REPORTED-SCREEN QUESTION NO. 3552-3553 V3451 7: INCIDENT REPORTED-SCREEN QUESTION NO. 4167-4168 V314 1: INCIDENT NUMBER 479-480 V837 2: INCIDENT NUMBER 1094-1095 V1360 3: INCIDENT NUMBER 1709-1710 V1883 4: INCIDENT NUMBER 2324-2325 V2406 5: INCIDENT NUMBER 2939-2940 V2929 6: INCIDENT NUMBER 3554-3555 V3452 7: INCIDENT NUMBER 4169-4170 V315 1: RESIDENCE DURING THIS INCIDENT 481-481 V838 2: RESIDENCE DURING THIS INCIDENT 1096-1096 V1361 3: RESIDENCE DURING THIS INCIDENT 1711-1711 V1884 4: RESIDENCE DURING THIS INCIDENT 2326-2326 V2407 5: RESIDENCE DURING THIS INCIDENT 2941-2941 V2930 6: RESIDENCE DURING THIS INCIDENT 3556-3556 V3453 7: RESIDENCE DURING THIS INCIDENT 4171-4171 V316 1: MONTH OF THIS INCIDENT 482-483 V839 2: MONTH OF THIS INCIDENT 1097-1098 V1362 3: MONTH OF THIS INCIDENT 1712-1713 V1885 4: MONTH OF THIS INCIDENT 2327-2328 V2408 5: MONTH OF THIS INCIDENT 2942-2943 V2931 6: MONTH OF THIS INCIDENT 3557-3558 V3454 7: MONTH OF THIS INCIDENT 4172-4173 Page 29  V317 1: YEAR OF THIS INCIDENT 484-485 V840 2: YEAR OF THIS INCIDENT 1099-1100 V1363 3: YEAR OF THIS INCIDENT 1714-1715 V1886 4: YEAR OF THIS INCIDENT 2329-2330 V2409 5: YEAR OF THIS INCIDENT 2944-2945 V2932 6: YEAR OF THIS INCIDENT 3559-3560 V3455 7: YEAR OF THIS INCIDENT 4174-4175 V318 1: NO.
