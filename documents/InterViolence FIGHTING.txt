In other words, intent to use force does not necessarily mean intent to cause damage. Indeed, there may be a considerable disparity between intended behavior and intended consequence. A perpetrator may commit a seemingly dangerous act that will likely result in adverse health effects, but the perpetrator may not perceive it as such. For example, a youth may get in a physical fight with another youth. The use of a fist against the head or the use of a weapon in the dispute certainly increases the risk of serious injury or death, though neither outcome may be intended.Other aspects of violence are implied in this definition. For example, it includes all acts of violence, whether public or private, reactive (in response to previous events such as provocation), proactive (instrumental for or anticipating more self-serving outcomes), or criminal or noncriminal. Each of these aspects is important to understanding the causes of violence and in designing prevention programs.***¥ Êsudden changes in sleep habits¥ visible prolonged sadness¥ substance use or abuse¥ seeing or hearing things that are not there¥ comments or writings that suggest a desire to harm himself or others¥ thinks others are plotting against himhas inappropriate access to, possession of, and/or use of firearms
