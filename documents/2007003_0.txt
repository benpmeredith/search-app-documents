EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for teaching and learning, free of crime and
violence. Any instance of crime or violence at school not only affects the individuals
involved but also may disrupt the educational process and affect bystanders, the school
itself, and the surrounding community (Henry 2000).
For parents, school staff, and policymakers to address school crime effectively, they
must possess an accurate understanding of the extent and nature of the problem. However, without collecting data, it is difﬁcult to adequately gauge the scope of crime and
violence in schools given the large amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of
extreme school violence. Ensuring safer schools requires establishing good indicators of
the current state of school crime and safety across the nation and periodically monitoring
and updating these indicators. This is the aim of Indicators of School Crime and Safety.
This report is the ninth in a series of annual publications produced jointly by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Institute of Education Sciences (IES), in the
U.S. Department of Education and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) in the U.S. Department of Justice. This report presents the most recent data available on school crime
and student safety. The indicators in this report are based on information drawn from a
variety of independent data sources, including national surveys of students, teachers,
and principals, and data collections from federal departments and agencies, including
BJS, NCES, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. The most recent data collection for each indicator varied by survey,
from 2003–04 to 2005. Each data source has an independent sample design, data collection method, and questionnaire design or is the result of a universe data collection.
All comparisons described in this report are statistically signiﬁcant at the .05 level.
In 2005, the unit response rate for the School Crime Supplement did not meet NCES
statistical standards; therefore, interpret the 2005 data from Indicators 3, 8, 10, 11, 16,
17, and 20 with caution. Additional information about methodology and the datasets
analyzed in this report may be found in appendix A.
This report covers topics such as victimization, ﬁghts, bullying, disorder, weapons, student perceptions of school safety, teacher injury, and drugs and alcohol. Indicators of
crime and safety are compared across different population subgroups and over time.
Data on crimes that occur outside of school grounds are offered as a point of comparison where available.

KEY FINDINGS
In the 2004–05 school year, an estimated 54.9 million students were enrolled in
prekindergarten through grade 12 (U.S. Department of Education forthcoming). Preliminary data on fatal victimizations show youth ages 5–18 were victims of 28 schoolassociated violent deaths from July 1, 2004, through June 30, 2005 (21 homicides

and 7 suicides) (Indicator 1). In 2004, students ages 12–18 were victims of about 1.4
million nonfatal crimes at school, including about 863,000 thefts5 and 583,000 violent crimes6 (simple assault and serious violent crime)—107,000 of which were serious violent crimes (rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault) (Indicator 2).
These ﬁgures represent victimization rates of 33 thefts and 22 violent crimes, including
4 serious violent crimes, per 1,000 students at school in 2004. Some of these indicators document that student safety has improved. The victimization rate1 of students
ages 12–18 at school2 declined from 73 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2003 to
55 victimizations in 2004.3 However, other aspects of crime have not improved. The
number of homicides of school-age youth ages 5–18 at school was higher in 2004–05
than in 2000–01 (21 vs. 11 homicides), but remained below the number of homicides
of school-age youth for most years in the 1990’s.4 Violence, theft, drugs, and weapons
continue to pose problems in schools. In 2005, 25 percent of students in grades 9–12
reported that drugs were made available to them on school property and 8 percent of
students were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property in the previous
12 months. The following section presents key ﬁndings of the report.

Violent Deaths
•

From July 1, 2004, through June 30, 2005, there were 21 homicides and 7 suicides of
school-age youth (ages 5–18) at school (Indicator 1). Combined, this number translates
into about 1 homicide or suicide of a school-age youth at school per 2 million students
enrolled during the 2004–05 school year.

Nonfatal Student Victimization
•

In 2004, students ages 12–18 were victims of about 1.4 million nonfatal crimes at
school, including about 863,000 thefts and 583,000 violent crimes—107,000 of which
were serious violent crimes (rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault) (Indicator 2).

•

In 2004, students ages 12–18 were more likely to be victims of theft at school than
away from school (Indicator 2). That year, 33 thefts per 1,000 students occurred at
school and 27 thefts occurred away from school (Indicator 2).

•

Total crime and theft victimization rates for students both at school and away from
school were lower in 2004 than 2003 (Indicator 2). In 2003, there were 73 victimizations per 1,000 students at school, compared with 55 victimizations in 2004. Theft victimization at school declined from 45 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2003 to 33
victimizations of students in 2004.

1 The

victimization rate is based on the number of thefts, violent crimes, or serious crimes per 1,000 students.
See appendix B for a detailed deﬁnition of “at school.”
3 Data in this report are not adjusted by the number of hours that youths spend on school property versus the
number of hours they spend elsewhere.
4 Data from 1999–2005 are preliminary and subject to change.
5 Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and completed thefts except motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which threat or use of force is involved.
6 Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and simple assault.

•

Away from school, total crime and violent crime victimization rates for students also
decreased between 2003 and 2004 (Indicator 2). In 2003, there were 60 victimizations per 1,000 students away from school, compared with 48 victimizations in 2004.
Violent victimization declined from 32 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2003 to 21
victimizations in 2004.

•

In 2005, 4 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being victimized at school during
the previous 6 months: 3 percent reported theft, and 1 percent reported violent victimization (Indicator 3). Less than half of a percent of students reported serious violent
victimization.

•

Between 2003 and 2005, the percentage of students reporting victimization declined
(from 5 to 4 percent), as did the percentage reporting theft (from 4 to 3 percent); there
were no measurable declines in the percentages reporting violent and serious violent
crime during the same period (Indicator 3).

•

In 2005, 10 percent of male students in grades 9–12 reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property in the past year, compared with 6 percent of
female students (Indicator 4).

•

Hispanic students were more likely than White students to report being threatened or
injured with a weapon on school property in 2005 (10 vs. 7 percent) (Indicator 4).

Threats and Attacks on Teachers
•

In 2003–04, teachers’ reports of being threatened or attacked by students during the
previous 12 months varied according to their school level (Indicator 5). Secondary
school teachers were more likely than elementary school teachers to have been threatened with injury by a student (8 vs. 6 percent). However, elementary school teachers
were more likely than secondary teachers to report having been physically attacked (4
vs. 2 percent).

•

Ten percent of teachers in central city schools reported in 2003–04 that they were
threatened with injury by students, compared with 6 percent of teachers in urban fringe
schools and 5 percent in rural schools (Indicator 5). Five percent of teachers in central
city schools were attacked by students, compared with 3 percent of teachers in urban
fringe and 2 percent in rural schools.

•

Public school teachers were more likely than private school teachers to have been
threatened (7 vs. 2 percent) or physically attacked (4 vs. 2 percent) by students in
school (Indicator 5). Among teachers in central city schools, those in public schools
were at least ﬁve times more likely to be threatened with injury than their colleagues in
private schools (12 vs. 2 percent) and at least four times more likely to be physically attacked (5 vs. 1 percent).

School Environment
•

The percentage of public schools experiencing one or more violent incidents increased
between the 1999–2000 and 2003–04 school years, from 71 to 81 percent (Indicator
6). Both primary schools and high schools had lower rates of violent crimes per 1,000
students than middle schools. In 2003–04, there were 28 violent crimes per 1,000 students in both primary schools and high schools, compared with 53 violent crimes in
middle schools.

•

In 2003–04, 2 percent of public schools reported daily or weekly occurrences of racial tensions among students and 27 percent reported daily or weekly student bullying
(Indicator 7). With regard to other frequently occurring discipline problems in public
schools (those occurring at least once a week), 11 percent of principals reported student verbal abuse of teachers, 3 percent reported widespread disorder in classrooms,
and 19 percent reported student acts of disrespect for teachers. About 17 percent of
public schools reported undesirable gang activities and 3 percent reported undesirable
cult or extremist activities.

•

The prevalence of frequently occurring discipline problems was related to school enrollment size in the 2003–04 school year (Indicator 7). In general, principals in large
schools were more likely to report discipline problems than principals in small schools.
Thirty-four percent of principals at schools with 1,000 or more students reported student acts of disrespect for teachers at least once per week, compared with 21 percent
of those at schools with 500–999 students, 17 percent of those at schools with 300–499
students, and 14 percent of those at schools with less than 300 students.

•

In 2005, 24 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that there were gangs at their
schools (Indicator 8). Students in urban schools (36 percent) were more likely to report
the presence of gangs at their school than suburban students (21 percent) and rural students (16 percent).

•

The percentage of students reporting the presence of gangs increased from 21 to 24
percent between 2003 and 2005 (Indicator 8). The percentage of students at urban
schools reporting the presence of gangs at school increased from 31 to 36 percent during this period.

•

In 2005, one-quarter of all students in grades 9–12 reported that someone had offered,
sold, or given them an illegal drug on school property in the past 12 months (Indicator
9).

•

Eleven percent of students ages 12–18 reported that someone at school had used haterelated words against them, and more than one-third (38 percent) had seen hate-related
grafﬁti at school in 2005 (Indicator 10).

•

In 2005, 28 percent of students ages 12–18 reported having been bullied at school during the last 6 months (Indicator 11). Of these students, 58 percent said that the bullying
had happened once or twice during that period, 25 percent had experienced bullying

once or twice a month, 11 percent reported having been bullied once or twice a week,
and 8 percent said they had been bullied almost daily.
•

Of those students who reported bullying incidents that involved being pushed, shoved,
tripped, or spit on (9 percent), 24 percent reported that they had sustained an injury7
during the previous 6 months as a result (Indicator 11). While no measurable differences were found by sex in students’ likelihood of reporting a bullying incident in 2005,
among students who reported being bullied, males were more likely than females to
report being injured during such an incident (31 vs. 18 percent).

Fights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances
•

In 2005, 36 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported they had been in a ﬁght anywhere, and 14 percent said they had been in a ﬁght on school property during the previous 12 months (Indicator 12). In the same year, 43 percent of males said they had been
in a ﬁght anywhere, compared with 28 percent of females, and 18 percent of males said
they had been in a ﬁght on school property, compared with 9 percent of females.

•

Nineteen percent of students in grades 9–12 in 2005 reported they had carried a
weapon anywhere, and about 6 percent reported they had carried a weapon on school
property during the previous 30 days (Indicator 13). Males were two times more likely
than females to carry a weapon—either anywhere or on school property—in all survey
years (1993–2005). In 2005, for example, 10 percent of males carried a weapon on
school property, compared with 3 percent of females, and 30 percent of males carried
a weapon anywhere, compared with 7 percent of females.

•

In 2005, 43 percent of students in grades 9–12 consumed at least one drink of alcohol
anywhere, and 4 percent consumed at least one drink on school property during the
previous 30 days (Indicator 14). Hispanic students (8 percent) were more likely to use
alcohol on school property than White, Black, or Asian students (4, 3, and 1 percent,
respectively).

•

Twenty percent of students in grades 9–12 in 2005 reported using marijuana anywhere
during the past 30 days, and 5 percent reported using marijuana on school property
during this period (Indicator 15). At school, Hispanic students (8 percent) and American
Indian students (9 percent) were more likely to report using marijuana than White or
Black students (4 and 5 percent, respectively).

Fear and Avoidance
•

In 2005, approximately 6 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they were afraid of
attack or harm at school, and 5 percent reported that they were afraid of attack or harm
away from school (Indicator 16). The percentage of students who reported that they were
afraid of being attacked at school (including on the way to and from school) decreased

7Injury

includes bruises or swelling; cuts, scratches, or scrapes; black eye or bloody nose; teeth chipped or
knocked out; broken bones or internal injuries; knocked unconscious; or other injuries.

from 12 to 6 percent between 1995 and 2001; however, no difference was detected in the
percentage of students who feared an attack away from school between 1999 and 2005.
•

Black and Hispanic students were more likely than White students to fear for their safety regardless of location in 2005 (Indicator 16). Nine percent of Black students and 10
percent of Hispanic students reported that they were afraid of being attacked at school
(including on the way to and from school), compared with 4 percent of White students.
Away from school, 7 percent of Black students, 6 percent of Hispanic students, and 4
percent of White students reported that they were afraid of an attack.

•

In 2005, 6 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they had avoided a school
activity or one or more places in school in the previous 6 months because of fear of
attack or harm: 2 percent of students avoided a school activity, and 4 percent avoided
one or more places in school (Indicator 17). Consistent with most previous years, students in urban areas in 2005 were the most likely to avoid places in school: 6 percent
of urban students reported that they had done so, compared with 4 percent of suburban
and rural students.

Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures
•

About 46 percent of public schools took at least one serious disciplinary action against
students—including suspensions lasting 5 days or more, removals with no services
(i.e., expulsions), and transfers to specialized schools—for speciﬁc offenses during the
2003–04 school year (Indicator 18). Of those serious disciplinary actions, 74 percent
were suspensions for 5 days or more, 5 percent were removals with no services, and 21
percent were transfers to specialized schools.

•

Four percent of all public schools took one or more serious disciplinary actions in
response to students’ use or possession of a ﬁrearm or explosive device in 2003–04
(Indicator 18). Students’ use or possession of weapons other than ﬁrearms resulted in at
least one serious disciplinary action in 17 percent of schools.

•

In 2003–04, 83 percent of public schools controlled access to school buildings by
locking or monitoring doors during school hours, and 36 percent controlled access to
school grounds with locked or monitored gates (Indicator 19). Nearly all public schools
required visitors to sign or check in when entering the school building (98 percent),
while few schools required either students or visitors to pass through metal detectors
regularly (1 percent each).

•

The vast majority of students ages 12–18 reported that their school had a student code
of conduct (95 percent) and a requirement that visitors sign in (93 percent) in 2005 (Indicator 20). Metal detectors were the least observed security measure, with 11 percent
of students reporting their use at their school.

FOREWORD
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2006 provides the most recent national indicators on school crime and safety. Some of these indicators document that student safety
has improved. For example, the victimization rate of students ages 12–18 at school declined from 73 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2003 to 55 per 1,000 students victimizations in 2004. However, other aspects of crime have not improved. For example,
the number of homicides of school-age youth ages 5–18 was higher in 2004–05 than
2000–01 (21 vs. 11 homicides), but the number remained below most years during the
1990’s. In 2004, students ages 12–18 were victims of about 583,000 violent crimes
and 863,000 crimes of theft at school. In 2005, 25 percent of students in grades 9–12
reported that drugs were made available to them on school property and 8 percent of
students were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property in the previous
12 months.
The information presented in this report is intended to serve as a reference for policymakers and practitioners so that they can develop effective programs and policies
aimed at violence and school crime prevention. Accurate information about the nature,
extent, and scope of the problem being addressed is essential for developing effective
programs and policies.
This is the ninth edition of Indicators of School Crime and Safety, a joint publication
of the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the National Center for Education Statistics
(NCES). This report provides detailed statistics to inform the nation about current aspects of crime and safety in schools.
The 2006 edition of Indicators includes the most recent available data, compiled from
a number of statistical data sources supported by the federal government. Such sources
include results from a study of violent deaths in schools, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the National
Crime Victimization Survey and School Crime Supplement to the survey, sponsored
by the BJS and NCES, respectively; the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, sponsored by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the Schools and Stafﬁng Survey and
School Survey on Crime and Safety, both sponsored by NCES.
The entire report is available on the Internet. The Bureau of Justice Statistics and the
National Center for Education Statistics continue to work together in order to provide
timely and complete data on the issues of school-related violence and safety.

INTRODUCTION
Our nation’s schools should be a safe haven for teaching and learning free of crime
and violence. Even though students are less likely to be victims of a violent crime at
school1 than away from school (Indicators 1 and 2), any instance of crime or violence
at school not only affects the individuals involved but also may disrupt the educational
process and affect bystanders, the school itself, and the surrounding community (Henry
2000). For both students and teachers, victimization at school can have lasting effects.
In addition to experiencing loneliness, depression, and adjustment difﬁculties (Crick
and Bigbee 1998; Crick and Grotpeter 1996; Nansel et al. 2001; Prinstein, Boergers,
and Vernberg 2001; Storch et al. 2003), victimized children are more prone to truancy
(Ringwalt, Ennett, and Johnson 2003), poor academic performance (Wei and Williams
2004), dropping out of school (Beauvais et al. 1996), and violent behaviors (Nansel et
al. 2003). For teachers, incidents of victimization may lead to professional disenchantment and even departure from the profession altogether (Karcher 2002).
For parents, school staff, and policymakers to effectively address school crime, they
need an accurate understanding of the extent, nature, and context of the problem.
However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the scope of crime and violence in schools given the
large amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of extreme school violence.
Measuring progress toward safer schools requires establishing good indicators of the
current state of school crime and safety across the nation and periodically monitoring
and updating these indicators; this is the aim of Indicators of School Crime and Safety.

PURPOSE

AND

ORGANIZATION

OF THIS

REPORT

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2006 is the ninth in a series of reports produced
by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) since 1998 that present the most recent data available on school crime and
student safety. The report is not intended to be an exhaustive compilation of school
crime and safety information, nor does it attempt to explore reasons for crime and violence in schools. Rather, it is designed to provide a brief summary of information from
an array of data sources and to make data on national school crime and safety accessible to policymakers, educators, parents, and the general public.
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2006 is organized into sections that delineate
speciﬁc concerns to readers, starting with a description of the most serious violent
crimes. The sections cover Violent Deaths at School; Nonfatal Student Victimization;
Threats and Attacks on Teachers; School Environment; Fights, Weapons, and Illegal
Substances; Fear and Avoidance; and Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures. Each
section contains a set of indicators that, taken together, aim to describe a distinct aspect of school crime and safety. Where available, data on crimes that occur outside of

school grounds are offered as a point of comparison.2 Supplemental tables for each
indicator provide more detailed breakouts and standard errors for estimates. A glossary
of terms and references section appear at the end of the report.
This year’s report contains updates for all indicators and the expansion of two existing indicators, Indicator 5 on threats to and injuries of teachers and Indicator 11 on
bullying. In response to requests for state-level information, tables showing available
state-level estimates have been added to Indicator 5. These estimates have been added
for the past three survey years. Indicator 11 looks at seven types of bullying, where reported incidents of bullying took place in school, whether any injuries were sustained
as a result of being bullied, and the frequency of bullying incidents among students
who were bullied.
The indicator related to nonfatal teacher victimization at school has been discontinued.
Because of sample cuts to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and declining victimization rates, the survey’s capacity to provide useful estimates of teacher victimization has diminished, especially for disaggregated subcategories of teacher characteristics. The indicator has been determined to no longer be an adequate measure of
teacher victimization.
Also found in this year’s report are references to recent publications relevant to each
indicator that the reader may want to consult for additional information or analyses.
These references can be found in the “For more information” sidebars at the bottom of
each indicator.

DATA
The indicators in this report are based on information drawn from a variety of independent data sources, including national surveys of students, teachers, and principals and
universe data collections from federal departments and agencies, including BJS, NCES,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each data source has an independent sample design, data collection method, and
questionnaire design or is the result of a universe data collection.
The combination of multiple, independent sources of data provides a broad perspective
on school crime and safety that could not be achieved through any single source of
information. However, readers should be cautious when comparing data from different
sources. While every effort has been made to keep key deﬁnitions consistent across
indicators, differences in sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and question
phrasing can all affect the comparability of results. For example, both Indicators 19 and
20 report data on select security and safety measures used in schools. Indicator 19 uses
data collected from a stratiﬁed random sample of principals about safety and security
practices used in their schools during the 2003–04 school year. Indicator 20, however,

uses data collected from 12- through 18-year-olds in a rotated panel design of households. These students were asked whether they observed selected safety and security
measures in their school in 2005, but they may not have known if, in fact, the security
measure was present. In addition, different indicators contain various approaches to the
analysis of school crime data and, therefore, will show different perspectives on school
crime. For example, both Indicators 2 and 3 report data on theft and violent crime
at school based on the National Crime Victimization Survey and the School Crime
Supplement to that survey, respectively. While Indicator 2 examines the number of
incidents of crime, Indicator 3 examines the percentage or prevalence of students who
reported victimization. Figure A provides a summary of some of the variations in the
design and coverage of sample surveys used in this report.
Several indicators in this report are based on self-reported survey data. Readers should
note that limitations inherent to self-reported data may affect estimates (Cantor and
Lynch 2000). First, unless an interview is “bounded” or a reference period is established, estimates may include events that exceed the scope of the speciﬁed reference
period. This factor may artiﬁcially increase reports because respondents may recall
events outside of the given reference period. Second, many of the surveys rely on the
respondent to “self-determine” a condition. This factor allows the respondent to deﬁne

a situation based upon his or her own interpretation of whether the incident was a
crime or not. On the other hand, the same situation may not necessarily be interpreted
in the same way by a bystander or the perceived offender. Third, victim surveys tend to
emphasize crime events as incidents that take place at one point in time. However, victims can often experience a state of victimization in which they are threatened or victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally, respondents may recall an event inaccurately.
For instance, people may forget the event entirely or recall the speciﬁcs of the episode
incorrectly. These and other factors may affect the precision of the estimates based on
these surveys.
Data trends are discussed in this report when possible. Where trends are not discussed,
either the data are not available in earlier surveys or the wording of the survey question changed from year to year, eliminating the ability to discuss any trend. Where
data from samples are reported, as is the case with most of the indicators in this report,
the standard error is calculated for each estimate provided in order to determine the
“margin of error” for these estimates. The standard errors of the estimates for different
subpopulations in an indicator can vary considerably and should be taken into account
when making comparisons. Some estimates and standard errors have been revised from
those provided in earlier editions of Indicators of School Crime and Safety and other
previously published reports. Throughout this report, in cases where the standard error
was at least 30 percent of the associated estimate, the estimates were noted with a “!”
symbol (interpret data with caution). In cases where the standard error was greater than
50 percent of the associated estimate, the estimate was suppressed. See appendix A for
more information.
The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical signiﬁcance to ensure that
the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Unless
otherwise noted, all statements cited in the report are statistically signiﬁcant at the .05
level. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the statement being tested. The primary test procedure used in
this report was the Student’s t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample
estimates. Linear trend tests were used when differences among percentages were examined relative to ordered categories of a variable, rather than the differences between
two discrete categories. This test allows one to examine whether, for example, the
percentage of students who reported using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or
whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school
increased (or decreased) with age. When differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordered categories (such as grade), analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables.
Appendix A of this report contains descriptions of all the datasets used in this report
and a discussion of how standard errors were calculated for each estimate.

VIOLENT DEATHS

Indicator

1

VIOLENT DEATHS AT SCHOOL AND AWAY FROM SCHOOL
The number of homicides of youth ages 5–18 at school was higher in 2004–05
than 2000–01 (21 vs. 11 homicides), but remained lower than most years during
the 1990’s.
Violent deaths at schools are rare but tragic events with far-reaching effects on the school
population and surrounding community (Small and Dressler-Tetrick 2001). From July 1,
2004, through June 30, 2005, there were 48 school-associated violent deaths in elementary
and secondary schools in the United States (tables 1.1 and 1.2). In this indicator, a schoolassociated violent death is deﬁned as “a homicide, suicide, legal intervention (involving a
law enforcement ofﬁcer), or unintentional ﬁrearm-related death in which the fatal injury
occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United
States.” Victims of school-associated violent deaths include students, staff members, and
others who are not students. Deaths that occurred while the victim was on the way to or
from regular sessions at school, or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an
ofﬁcial school-sponsored event, were also considered school-associated violent deaths. To
enable comparisons of homicides and suicides at school and away from school, data were
drawn from a number of sources. Data for school-associated violent deaths from the 1999–
2000 through 2004–05 school years are preliminary.
From July 1, 2004, through June 30, 2005, there were 21 homicides and 7 suicides of schoolage youth (ages 5–18) at school (table 1.1).3 Combined, this number translates into about 1
homicide or suicide of a school-age youth at school per 2 million students enrolled during
the 2004–05 school year.4 The most recent data available for the total number of homicides of
school-age youth are from the 2003–04 school year (ﬁgure 1.1 and table 1.1), at which time
there were 1,437 homicides. In the 2003 calendar year, there were 1,285 suicides of school-age
youth.5 In each school year, youth were over 50 times more likely to be murdered and almost
150 times more likely to commit suicide when they were away from school than at school.

This indicator has
been updated to
include revisions
to previously
published data
and new data for
2002 onward.

Between July 1, 1992, and June 30, 1999, no consistent pattern of increase or decrease was
observed in the number of homicides at school (ﬁgure 1.2 and table 1.1). During this period, between 28 and 34 homicides of school-age youth occurred at school in each school
year. However, the number of homicides of school-age youth at school declined between
the 1998–99 and 1999–2000 school years from 33 to 13 homicides. Between the 2000–01
and 2004–05 school years, the number of homicides of school-age youth at school increased from 11 to 21. While the absolute number of homicides of school-age youth at
school has varied, the percentage of youth homicides occurring at school remained at less
than 2 percent of the total number of youth homicides over all survey years. Between the
1992–93 and 2004–05 school years, from one to nine school-age youth committed suicide
at school each year, with no consistent pattern of increase or decrease.
3

Between July 1, 2004, and June 30, 2005, there were 48 student, staff, and nonstudent school-associated
violent deaths, including 37 homicides, 9 suicides, and 2 legal interventions (table 1.2).
4 The total projected number of students enrolled in prekindergarten through 12th grade during the 2004–05
school year was 54,593,000 (U.S. Department of Education 2006).
5 Data on suicides away from school are available only by calendar year, whereas data on suicides and homicides at school and homicides away from school are available by school year.

INCIDENCE OF VICTIMIZATION AT SCHOOL AND AWAY FROM SCHOOL
Between 1992 and 2004, the victimization rates for students ages 12–18 generally
declined both at school and away from school.
Theft and violence at school and while going to and from school can lead to a disruptive and
threatening environment, physical injury, and emotional stress, and can be an obstacle to student
achievement (Elliott, Hamburg, and Williams 1998). Data from the National Crime Victimization
Survey show that students ages 12–18 were victims of about 1.4 million nonfatal crimes (theft
plus violent crime) while they were at school and about 1.3 million crimes while they were
away from school in 2004 (table 2.1).6 These ﬁgures represent victimization rates of 55 crimes
per 1,000 students at school, and 48 crimes per 1,000 students away from school (ﬁgure 2.1).
Between 1992 and 2004, the victimization rates for students ages 12–18 generally declined
both at school and away from school; this pattern held for the total crime rate as well as for
thefts,7 violent crimes,8 and serious violent crimes9 (table 2.1). At school, total crime and
theft victimization rates for students were lower in 2004 than in 2003. For example, the victimization rate of students ages 12–18 at school declined from 73 victimizations per 1,000
students in 2003 to 55 such victimizations in 2004. Theft victimization at school declined
from 45 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2003 to 33 such victimizations of students in
2004. Away from school, total crime and violent crime victimization rates were lower in
2004 than in 2003. There were 48 victimizations per 1,000 students away from school in
2004, compared with 60 victimizations in 2003. Violent victimization away from school
declined from 32 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2003 to 21 victimizations in 2004.
Students ages 12–18 were more likely to be victims of theft at school than away from school
in most years between 1992 and 2004. In 2004, students were victims of 863,000 crimes of
theft at school and 706,000 crimes of theft away from school. This translates into 33 thefts
per 1,000 students at school, compared with 27 thefts per 1,000 students away from school.
From 1992 to 1997, the victimization rates for violent crime were generally lower at school
than away from school; however, there were no measurable differences in these rates in the
years between 1998 and 2004, except in 2000, when victimization rates at school were
lower. The rates for serious violent crime were lower at school than away from school in
each survey year from 1992 to 2004. In 2004, students ages 12–18 were victims of 4 serious violent crimes per 1,000 students at school compared with 9 serious violent crimes per
1,000 students away from school.

In 2004, the victimization rates for students ages 12–18 varied according to certain student
characteristics. Older students (ages 15–18) were less likely than younger students (ages 12–14)
to be victims of crime at school, but the reverse was true for the likelihood of crime away from
school (ﬁgures 2.2 and 2.3 and tables 2.2 and 2.3). Females had a lower rate of violent victimization at school and a lower rate of serious violent victimization away from school than males,
but no measurable gender differences were found in the rates of theft at and away from school.

“Students” refers to persons ages 12–18 who reported being in any elementary or secondary grade at the
time of the survey. An uncertain percentage of these persons may not have attended school during the survey
reference period. These data do not take into account the number of hours that students spend at school or
away from school.
7 Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and
completed thefts except motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which threat or use of force is
involved.
8 Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and simple assault.
9 Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.

PREVALENCE OF VICTIMIZATION AT SCHOOL
In 2005, some 4 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being victimized at
school during the previous 6 months. About 3 percent reported theft, 1 percent
reported violent victimization, and less than half of a percent of students reported
serious violent victimization.
Theft is the most frequent type of nonfatal crime in the United States (U.S. Department of
Justice 2006). Data from the School Crime Supplement10 to the National Crime Victimization Survey show the percentage of students ages 12–18 who reported criminal victimization at school during the previous 6 months. In 2005, some 4 percent of students ages
12–18 reported being victimized at school during the previous 6 months. About 3 percent
reported theft,11 1 percent reported violent victimization12 (ﬁgure 3.1 and table 3.1), and
less than half of a percent of students reported serious violent victimization.13
Overall, the percentage of students ages 12–18 who were victimized at school during the
previous 6 months decreased between 1995 and 2005 from 10 to 4 percent. For each type
of victimization, the percentage of students reporting victimization decreased between 1995
and 2005 (ﬁgure 3.1 and table 3.1). Between the most recent survey years (2003 and 2005),
the percentage of students reporting victimization declined from 5 to 4 percent, and the percentage reporting theft declined from 4 to 3 percent. There were no measurable changes in
the percentages reporting violent and serious violent crime during this period.
In 2005, the prevalence of victimization varied somewhat according to student characteristics. Male students were more likely than female students to report being victims of violent
crime at school (2 vs. 1 percent), but no measurable gender differences were detected in
the likelihood of reporting theft (3 percent each). There were also no measurable differences
in the percentages reporting victimization across grades. Further, in 2005, no measurable
differences were detected in the percentages of White, Black, or Hispanic students who
reported victimization, theft, or violent victimization. Students in urban schools were more
likely to report victimization (5 percent) and theft (4 percent) than students in rural schools
(3 and 2 percent, respectively). However, no other measurable differences were observed by
urbanicity.

THREATS AND INJURIES WITH WEAPONS ON SCHOOL PROPERTY
The percentage of students who were threatened or injured with a weapon has
fluctuated between 7–9 percent in all survey years from 1993 through 2005.

Every year, some students are threatened or injured with a weapon while they are on school
property. The percentage of students victimized in this way provides an important measure
of how safe our schools are and how their safety has changed over time. In the Youth Risk
Behavior Survey, students in grades 9–12 were asked whether they had been threatened
or injured with a weapon on school property during the 12 months preceding the survey.
In 2005, some 8 percent of students reported being threatened or injured with a weapon,
such as a gun, knife, or club, on school property (table 4.1). The percentage of students who
were threatened or injured with a weapon ﬂuctuated between 1993 and 2005 without a
clear trend. In all survey years from 1993 through 2005, between 7–9 percent of students
reported being threatened or injured in this way.
The likelihood of being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property varied by
student characteristics. In each survey year, males were more likely than females to report
being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (ﬁgure 4.1 and table 4.1).
In 2005, some 10 percent of male students reported being threatened or injured in the past
year, compared with 6 percent of female students. In each survey year, students in lower
grades were generally more likely to report being threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property than those in higher grades (ﬁgure 4.2 and table 4.1). Eleven percent of 9thgraders reported that they were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property in
2005, compared with 9 percent of 10th-graders and 6 percent of 11th- and 12th-graders.
Students’ likelihood of being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property varied
by race/ethnicity in 2005. Hispanic students were more likely than White students to report
being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (10 vs. 7 percent). However,
no measurable differences were found in the percentages of Black and White students or
Black and Hispanic students who reported being threatened or injured in this way.

This indicator has
been updated
to include 2005
data.

In 2005, student reports of being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property
varied among states for which data were available. Among states, the percentage of students
with such reports ranged from 5 to 12 percent (table 4.2).

TEACHERS THREATENED WITH INJURY OR ATTACKED BY STUDENTS
In 2003–04, teachers in central city schools were more likely than their peers in
urban fringe or rural schools to report being threatened with injury or physically
attacked.
Students are not the only victims of intimidation or violence in schools. Teachers are also
subject to threats and physical attacks, and students from their schools sometimes commit
these offenses. In the Schools and Stafﬁng Survey, teachers were asked whether they had
been threatened with injury or physically attacked by a student from their school in the previous 12 months. A smaller percentage of teachers reported they were threatened with injury by a student from their school in 2003–04 (7 percent) than in 1993–94 and 1999–2000
(12 and 9 percent, respectively; ﬁgure 5.1 and table 5.1). Teachers were also less likely in
2003–04 than in 1993–94 to report having been physically attacked (3 vs. 4 percent; ﬁgure
5.1 and table 5.2).
Teachers in central city schools were consistently more likely to be threatened with injury
or physically attacked than teachers in urban fringe or rural schools between 1993–94 and
2003–04 (ﬁgure 5.2 and tables 5.1 and 5.2). For example, in 2003–04, some 10 percent of
teachers in central city schools were threatened with injury by students, compared with 6
percent of teachers in urban fringe schools and 5 percent of teachers in rural schools. Five
percent of teachers in central city schools were attacked by students, compared with 3 percent of teachers in urban fringe and 2 percent of teachers in rural schools.
In 2003–04, gender differences in the victimization of teachers were apparent (tables 5.1
and 5.2). Although a larger percentage of male than female teachers reported having been
threatened with injury (9 vs. 6 percent), female teachers were more likely than their male
counterparts to have been physically attacked (4 vs. 3 percent).

In 2003–04, teachers’ reports of being threatened or attacked by students varied according
to the level of their school. Secondary school teachers were more likely than elementary
school teachers to have been threatened with injury by a student (8 vs. 6 percent; table 5.1).
However, elementary school teachers were more likely than secondary school teachers to
report having been physically attacked (4 vs. 2 percent; table 5.2).
Public school teachers were more likely than private school teachers to have been threatened with injury (7 vs. 2 percent) or physically attacked (4 vs. 2 percent) by students in
school (ﬁgure 5.2 and tables 5.1 and 5.2). Among teachers in central city schools, those in
public schools were at least ﬁve times more likely to be threatened with injury than their
colleagues in private schools (12 vs. 2 percent) and at least four times more likely to be
physically attacked (5 vs. 1 percent).
Public school teachers’ reports of being threatened with injury or physically attacked varied
among states. In 2003–04, the percentage of public school teachers who reported being
threatened in the previous 12 months ranged from 4 to 18 percent (table 5.3), and the percentage who were physically attacked ranged from 1 to 7 percent (table 5.4).

VIOLENT AND OTHER INCIDENTS AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THOSE
REPORTED TO THE POLICE
The percentage of public schools experiencing one or more violent incidents
increased between the 1999–2000 and 2003–04 school years from 71 to 81 percent.
This indicator presents the percentage of schools that experienced one or more speciﬁed crimes, the total number of these crimes reported by schools, and the rate of crimes
per 1,000 students. These data are also presented for the crimes that were reported to the
police. In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school principals were asked to
provide the number of serious violent incidents,14 violent incidents,15 thefts valuing $10
or greater, and other incidents that occurred at their school, as well as the number of these
incidents reported to the police. In 2003–04, some 88 percent of public schools responded
that one or more incidents of these crimes had taken place (including violent, theft, and
other crimes), amounting to an estimated 2.1 million crimes (table 6.1). This ﬁgure translates
into a rate of 46 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled in 2003–04. During the same year, 65
percent of schools reported an incident of one of the speciﬁed crimes to the police amounting to about 764,400 crimes—or 16 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled.
The percentage of public schools experiencing one or more violent incidents increased between 1999–2000 and 2003–04 from 71 to 81 percent. In 2003–04, 18 percent of schools
experienced one or more serious violent incidents, 46 percent experienced one or more
thefts, and 64 percent experienced another type of crime (ﬁgure 6.1 and table 6.1). Fortyfour percent of public schools reported at least one violent incident to police, 13 percent
reported at least one serious violent incident to police, 31 percent reported at least one theft
to police, and 50 percent reported one of the other speciﬁed crimes to police.

been updated to
include 2003–04
data.

The prevalence of violent incidents at public schools and those reported to the police varied
by school level (ﬁgure 6.2 and tables 6.2 and 6.3). Primary schools were the least likely
to experience any violent incident: 74 percent of primary schools did so, compared with
94 percent of middle schools and 96 percent of high schools. Similar relationships were
observed for serious violent incidents and those violent and serious violent incidents that
were reported to the authorities. However, when looking at the rate of violent crimes per
1,000 students, both primary schools and high schools had lower rates than middle schools.
In 2003–04, there were 28 violent crimes per 1,000 students in both primary schools and
high schools, compared with 53 such violent crimes in middle schools. Regardless of school
level, there were no more than two serious violent crimes per 1,000 students enrolled in
2003–04.
When examining violent incidents by the location of public schools, city schools were more
likely than urban fringe schools to experience violent incidents (ﬁgure 6.3 and table 6.2).
Eighty-eight percent of city schools had one or more violent incidents, compared with 80
percent of urban fringe schools.

Serious violent incidents include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or ﬁght with a weapon, threat of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon.
15 Violent incidents include serious violent incidents plus physical attacks or ﬁghts without a weapon and
threats of physical attacks without a weapon.

DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS REPORTED BY PUBLIC SCHOOLS
The prevalence of frequently occurring discipline problems was related to school
size in the 2003–04 school year. In general, principals in large schools were more
likely to report discipline problems than principals in small schools.
The existence of discipline problems in a school may contribute to an environment that facilitates school violence and crime (Miller 2003 revised). In the School Survey on Crime and Safety,
school principals were asked how often certain disciplinary problems happen in their schools.
This indicator examines the daily or weekly occurrence of student racial tensions, bullying, verbal abuse of teachers, widespread classroom disorder, and acts of disrespect for teachers in public schools. It also looks at occurrences of gang and cult activities, and due to the severe nature
of these incidents, presents all reports of gang and cult activities during the 2003–04 school year.
Two percent of public schools reported racial tensions among students on a daily or weekly
basis and 27 percent reported that student bullying took place daily or weekly during the
2003–04 school year (ﬁgure 7.1 and table 7.1). With regard to other frequently occurring
discipline problems in public schools (those occurring at least once a week), 11 percent of
principals reported student verbal abuse of teachers, 3 percent reported widespread disorder
in classrooms, and 19 percent reported student acts of disrespect for teachers. Some 17 percent of public schools reported undesirable gang activities and 3 percent reported undesirable cult or extremist activities. Public school reports of student racial tensions were lower
in 2003–04 than in 1999–2000 (2 vs. 3 percent), as were any reports of cult or extremist
group activities (3 vs. 7 percent; data not shown, see DeVoe et al. 2005).
Discipline problems reported by public schools varied by school characteristics. For example,
middle schools were more likely than primary schools to report various types of discipline
problems (ﬁgure 7.1 and table 7.1). Middle schools were also more likely than high schools to
report daily or weekly incidences of student bullying (42 vs. 21 percent) and student acts of disrespect for teachers (32 vs. 26 percent). During the school year, high schools were more likely
than both middle and primary schools to report gang activity (41 vs. 31 and 8 percent, respectively) and more likely than middle schools to report extremist cult activity (13 vs. 6 percent).

been updated
with 2003–04
data.

The prevalence of frequently occurring discipline problems was related to school enrollment size. In general, principals in large schools were more likely to report discipline
problems than principals in small schools. Thirty-four percent of principals at schools with
1,000 or more students reported student acts of disrespect for teachers at least once a week,
compared with 21 percent of schools with 500–999 students, 17 percent of schools with
300–499 students, and 14 percent of schools with less than 300 students.
Schools where 20 percent or fewer of the students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch
were less likely to report student bullying, verbal abuse of teachers, widespread disorder in the
classroom, acts of disrespect for teachers, and undesirable gang activities than schools where
more students were eligible. Schools where 50 percent or more of the students were eligible for
free or reduced-price lunch were generally more likely to report discipline problems than schools
where fewer students qualiﬁed, except for student racial tensions, bullying, and cult activities.

STUDENTS’ REPORTS OF GANGS AT SCHOOL
The percentage of students reporting the presence of gangs at school increased
from 21 to 24 percent between 2003 and 2005.

Gangs are organized groups often involved in drugs, weapons trafﬁcking, and violence.
Such gangs at school can be disruptive to the school environment because their presence
may incite fear among students and increase the level of school violence (Laub and Lauritsen 1998). In the School Crime Supplement16 to the National Crime Victimization Survey,
students ages 12–18 were asked if gangs were present at their school during the previous
6 months.
In 2005, some 24 percent of students reported that there were gangs at their schools (ﬁgure
8.1 and table 8.1). Students in urban schools were more likely to report the presence of
gangs at their school than suburban students and rural students (36 vs. 21 and 16 percent,
respectively). No measurable difference was found between suburban and rural students in
their likelihood of reporting gang presence.
The total percentage of students who reported the presence of gangs at school increased
from 21 percent in 2003 to 24 percent in 2005. Similarly, the percentage of students at
urban schools who reported that gangs were present at school also increased during this
period from 31 to 36 percent. No measurable change was found for the percentage of suburban or rural students reporting gang presence during this period.
Hispanic and Black students were more likely than White students to report gangs in their
schools in 2005 (38 and 37 percent, respectively, vs. 17 percent; ﬁgure 8.2 and table 8.1).
This pattern held among students in both urban and suburban schools. Between 2003 and
2005, reports of gangs increased among both Black students (29 vs. 37 percent) and White
students (14 vs. 17 percent). No measurable change was detected in the percentage of Hispanic students reporting the presence of gangs between 2003 and 2005.

Students in public schools were more likely to report the presence of gangs than were students in private schools regardless of the school’s location (table 8.1). In 2005, some 25 percent of students in public schools reported that there were gangs in their schools, compared
with 4 percent of students in private schools.
In 2005, there were no measurable differences between males and females in the extent
to which they reported gang presence in their schools, with the exception of males at suburban schools, who were more likely to report gang presence than females (22 vs. 19 percent). Between 2001 and 2005, the percentage of male students reporting the presence of
gangs increased (from 21 to 25 percent), as did the percentage of suburban males reporting
gang activity (from 19 to 22 percent). In the same time period, the percentage of urban females reporting gang activity also increased from 26 to 34 percent.

STUDENTS’ REPORTS OF DRUG AVAILABILITY ON SCHOOL PROPERTY
In 2005, one-quarter of all students in grades 9–12 reported that someone had
offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug on school property in the past 12
months.
The availability of drugs on school property has a disruptive and corrupting inﬂuence on
the school environment (Nolin et al. 1997). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in
grades 9–12 were asked whether someone had offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug
on school property in the 12 months before the survey. In 2005, some 25 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported that drugs were made available to them on school property
(table 9.1). There was no measurable change in the percentage of students who reported
that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them at school between 2003 and 2005.
Males were more likely than females to report that drugs were offered, sold, or given to
them on school property in each survey year from 1993 to 2005 (ﬁgure 9.1 and table 9.1).
For example, in 2005, some 29 percent of males reported that drugs were available, compared with 22 percent of females. No measurable differences were detected in the percentage of students who reported that drugs were made available to them according to grade
level in 2005.
The percentages of students who reported having illegal drugs offered, sold, or given to
them on school property differed across racial/ethnic groups (ﬁgure 9.2 and table 9.1). Speciﬁcally, in 2005, Hispanic students were more likely than Asian, Black, American Indian,
and White students to report that drugs were made available to them (34 vs. 16–24 percent).
Although it appears that Paciﬁc Islander students were more likely than Hispanic students to
report that drugs were made available to them, the difference was not found to be statistically signiﬁcant.
In 2005, student reports of the availability of drugs on school property varied among states
for which data were available. Among states, the percentage of students who reported that
drugs were available to them at school ranged from 16 to 39 percent (table 9.2).

STUDENTS’ REPORTS OF BEING CALLED HATE-RELATED WORDS AND
SEEING HATE-RELATED GRAFFITI
In 2005, some 11 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that someone at school
had used hate-related words against them, and more than one-third (38 percent)
had seen hate-related graffiti at school.
In the 2005 School Crime Supplement17 to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students
ages 12–18 were asked if someone at school had called them a derogatory word having to
do with their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, or sexual orientation and if they had
seen hate-related grafﬁti during the previous 6 months. With regard to hate-related words,
students were also asked to specify the characteristic to which the word was directed.
In 2005, some 11 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that someone at school had
used hate-related words against them (ﬁgure 10.1 and table 10.1). Five percent of students
reported that the hate-related words concerned their race, 3 percent reported that the words
were related to their ethnicity, about 2 percent each reported that the words concerned their
religion or gender, and 1 percent each reported that the words were related to their disability or sexual orientation (table 10.2). Students were also asked if they had seen hate-related
grafﬁti at their school—that is, hate-related words or symbols written in classrooms, bathrooms, hallways, or on the outside of the school building (ﬁgure 10.1 and table 10.1). Some
38 percent of students saw hate-related grafﬁti at school.
Students’ experiences of being called speciﬁc types of hate-related words in 2005 differed
according to their sex and race/ethnicity (table 10.2). Females were more likely to report
gender-related hate words than were males (3 vs. 1 percent) while male students were more
likely than female students to report hate words related to both race (5 vs. 4 percent) and
ethnicity (3 vs. 2 percent). White students were less likely to report race-related hate words
than were Black and Hispanic students as well as students whose racial/ethnic group was
categorized as “Other” (3 percent of White students vs. 7 percent of Black students, 6 percent of Hispanic students, and 9 percent of Other students).

This indicator has
been updated
to include 2005
data.

In 2005, measurable differences were found in students’ reports of being called hate-related
words and seeing hate-related grafﬁti according to the urbanicity and sector of their schools
(ﬁgure 10.1 and table 10.1). Suburban students were less likely than both urban students
(9 vs. 12 percent) and rural students (9 vs. 15 percent) to report being called a hate-related
word. Public school students were more likely than their private school counterparts to report being called a hate-related word (12 vs. 7 percent) and seeing hate-related grafﬁti (39
vs. 18 percent).

BULLYING AT SCHOOL
In 2005, about 28 percent of 12- to 18-year-old students reported having been
bullied at school during the last 6 months.
Both bullying and being bullied at school are associated with key violence-related behaviors,
including carrying weapons, ﬁghting, and sustaining injuries from ﬁghting (Nansel et al. 2003).
In the 2005 School Crime Supplement18 to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students
ages 12–18 were asked if they had been bullied at school during the previous 6 months.19
In 2005, about 28 percent of students reported having been bullied at school during the
last 6 months (ﬁgure 11.1 and table 11.1). Nineteen percent of students said that they had
experienced bullying that consisted of being made fun of; 15 percent reported being the
subject of rumors; and 9 percent said that they were pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on (ﬁgure 11.2 and table 11.1). Of those students who had been bullied, 79 percent said that they
were bullied inside the school, and 28 percent said that they were bullied outside on school
grounds (ﬁgure 11.2 and table 11.2). Of the students in 2005 who reported being bullied
during the previous 6 months, 53 percent said that they had been bullied once or twice
during that period, 25 percent had experienced bullying once or twice a month, 11 percent
reported being bullied once or twice a week, and 8 percent said that they had been bullied
almost daily (table 11.3).
White and Black students (30 and 29 percent) were more likely than Hispanic students to
report being bullied in 2005 (22 percent; table 11.1). White students were also more likely
than students of Other racial/ethnic groups to report being bullied (30 vs. 25 percent), and
to report that they were the subject of rumors than were Hispanic students and students of
Other racial/ethnic groups (16 vs. 12 percent).
In general, grade level was inversely related to students’ likelihood of being bullied: as
grade level increased, students’ likelihood of being bullied decreased (table 11.1). In 2005,
about 37 percent of 6th-graders, 28 percent of 9th-graders, and 20 percent of 12th-graders
reported that they had been bullied at school. Students in public schools were more likely
to report bullying incidents than were their private school counterparts (29 vs. 23 percent).

This indicator has
been updated
with 2005 data.

Of those students who reported bullying incidents that involved being pushed, shoved,
tripped, or spit on (9 percent), 24 percent reported that they had sustained an injury20 as a result (table 11.2). While no measurable differences were found by sex in students’ likelihood of
reporting a bullying incident in 2005, among students who reported being bullied, males were
more likely than females to report being injured during such an incident (31 vs. 18 percent).

19 In 2005, the questionnaire wording for the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization
Survey was modiﬁed with regard to bullying. In the 1999, 2001, and 2003 surveys, students were simply
asked whether they had been bullied in the previous 6 months, while the 2005 iteration posed a series of
questions on bullying and provided respondents with more examples of bullying behavior. Bullying includes
being made fun of; subject of rumors; threatened with harm; pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; pressured
into doing things did not want to do; excluded; or property destroyed on purpose.
20 Injury includes bruises or swelling; cuts, scratches, or scrapes; black eye or bloody nose; teeth chipped or
knocked out; broken bones or internal injuries; knocked unconscious; or other injuries.

PHYSICAL FIGHTS ON SCHOOL PROPERTY AND ANYWHERE
The percentage of 9th- to 12th-grade students who reported being in a physical
fight anywhere increased from 33 to 36 percent between 2003 and 2005.

Schools where physical ﬁghts occur frequently may not be able to maintain a focused learning environment for students. Further, students who participate in ﬁghts on school property
may have difﬁculty succeeding in their studies (Payne, Gottfredson, and Gottfredson 2003).
In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9–12 were asked about their general
involvement in physical ﬁghts during the preceding 12 months (referred to as “anywhere”
in this report) and their involvement in physical ﬁghts on school property. In 2005, some
36 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported being in a ﬁght anywhere, and 14 percent
said they had been in a ﬁght on school property (table 12.1). Between 2003 and 2005, the
percentage of students who reported being in a ﬁght anywhere increased from 33 to 36 percent. However, there was no measurable change in the percentage of students who reported
ﬁghting on school property during the same period.
In all survey years, males were more likely than females to have been in a ﬁght anywhere
and on school property (ﬁgure 12.1 and table 12.1). In 2005, 43 percent of males said they
had been in a ﬁght anywhere, compared with 28 percent of females. In the same year, 18
percent of males said they had been in a ﬁght on school property, compared with 9 percent
of females. Between 2003 and 2005, the percentage of females who reported having been
in a physical ﬁght anywhere increased from 25 to 28 percent.
In 2005, students in lower grades were more likely to report being in ﬁghts than students in
higher grades, both anywhere and on school property (ﬁgure 12.2 and table 12.1). In that
year, 19 percent of 9th-graders, 14 percent of 10th-graders, 10 percent of 11th-graders, and
9 percent of 12th-graders reported being in a ﬁght on school property. While it appears that
students in most grades were more likely to report being in a physical ﬁght in 2005 than in
2003, the only measurable increase found was for 9th-grade students anywhere: between
2003 and 2005, the percentage of 9th-graders who reported having been in a ﬁght anywhere increased from 39 to 43 percent.

This indicator has
been updated
to include 2005
data.

In 2005, the percentage of students engaging in ﬁghts varied according to their race/ethnicity. Speciﬁcally, Asian students were less likely than students from all other racial/ethnic
groups to report being in a ﬁght anywhere or on school property. Six percent of Asian students reported being in a ﬁght on school property, compared with 12 to 24 percent of students from other racial/ethnic groups. Between 2003 and 2005, the percentage of Hispanic
students who reported having been in a ﬁght anywhere increased from 36 to 41 percent.
During the same period, the percentage of Asian students who reported having been in a
ﬁght on school property declined from 13 to 6 percent.

STUDENTS CARRYING WEAPONS ON SCHOOL PROPERTY AND
ANYWHERE
There was no measurable change in the percentage of students who carried a
weapon at school between 1999 and 2005: about 6 percent did so in both years.

The presence of weapons at school may interfere with teaching and learning by creating an
intimidating and threatening atmosphere (Aspy et al. 2004). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students were asked if they had carried a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club in the
past 30 days (referred to as “anywhere” in this report) or had carried one of these weapons
on school property in the past 30 days. In 2005, some 19 percent of students in grades 9–12
reported they had carried a weapon anywhere, and about 6 percent reported they had carried a weapon on school property (table 13.1).
The percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere declined from 22
to 18 percent between 1993 and 1997. However, subsequently, there was no measurable
change in the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere. Similar
to the pattern for carrying a weapon anywhere, between 1993 and 1999, the percentage of
students who reported carrying a weapon at school declined from 12 to 7 percent. However, there was no measurable change in the percentage of students who carried a weapon
at school between 1999 and 2005.
When looking at the characteristics of students who reported carrying weapons, males were
more than two times more likely than females to carry a weapon—either anywhere or on
school property—in all survey years (ﬁgure 13.1 and table 13.1). In 2005, for example, some
10 percent of males carried a weapon on school property, compared with 3 percent of females,
and 30 percent of males carried a weapon anywhere, compared with 7 percent of females.
In 2005, few differences were detected in the percentage of students who reported carrying
weapons anywhere and on school property according to students’ race/ethnicity (ﬁgure 13.2
and table 13.1). Asian students were less likely than students from all other racial/ethnic
groups, except Paciﬁc Islanders,21 to report carrying a weapon anywhere, but no measur-

able differences were detected among Black, White, and Hispanic students. Asian students
were also less likely than students from all other racial/ethnic groups, except for Blacks,
to report carrying a weapon on school property, but no differences were detected among
Black, White, and American Indian students. Hispanic students were more likely than Black
students to report carrying a weapon during the previous 30 days on school property in
2005 (8 vs. 5 percent). Between 2003 and 2005, the percentage of Hispanic students who
reported doing so increased from 6 to 8 percent.
In 2005, the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon varied among states
for which data were available. Among states, the percentages ranged from 11 to 28 percent
for carrying a weapon anywhere, and from 4 to 11 percent for carrying a weapon on school
property (table 13.2).

STUDENTS’ USE OF ALCOHOL ON SCHOOL PROPERTY AND ANYWHERE
In 2005, some 43 percent of students in grades 9–12 had at least one drink of
alcohol anywhere, and 4 percent had at least one drink on school property in the
30 days before being surveyed.
Students’ illegal consumption of alcohol on school property may lead to additional crimes
and misbehavior. It may also foster a school environment that is harmful to students, teachers, and staff (Fagan and Wilkinson 1998). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in
grades 9–12 were asked whether they had consumed alcohol at all in the past 30 days (referred to as “anywhere” in this report) and if they had consumed alcohol on school property. In 2005, some 43 percent of students consumed at least one drink of alcohol anywhere,
and 4 percent consumed at least one drink on school property (table 14.1). The percentage
of students who reported drinking alcohol anywhere increased from 48 to 52 percent between 1993 and 1995 and then declined to 43 percent in 2005. No consistent pattern was
detected in the percentage of students who reported consuming alcohol on school property
between 1993 and 2005: over these years, the percentage ﬂuctuated from 4 to 6 percent.
The likelihood of drinking alcohol varied by student characteristics including sex, grade
level, and race/ethnicity. In 2005, males were more likely than females to report using alcohol on school property (5 vs. 3 percent), a difference not found in the percentage who
reported drinking anywhere (ﬁgure 14.1 and table 14.1). In 2005, students in higher grades
were more likely to report drinking alcohol anywhere than were students in lower grades.
For example, 51 percent of 12th-graders reported using alcohol, compared with 36 percent
of 9th-graders (ﬁgure 14.2 and table 14.1). However, no measurable difference was found
across grade levels in students’ likelihood of drinking alcohol on school property.
In 2005, Asian and Black students were less likely to report using alcohol anywhere than
were American Indian, White, or Hispanic students. Twenty-two percent of Asian students
and 31 percent of Black students reported using alcohol anywhere, compared with 46
percent of White students, 47 percent of Hispanic students, and 57 percent of American
Indian students. In the same year, Hispanic students (8 percent) were more likely to use
alcohol on school property than were White, Black, or Asian students (4, 3, and 1 percent,
respectively).

This indicator has
been updated
to include 2005
data.
•••

In 2005, the percentage of students who reported drinking alcohol varied among states for
which data were available. Among states, the percentages ranged from 16 to 49 percent for
drinking alcohol anywhere, and from 2 to 9 percent for drinking alcohol on school property
(table 14.2).

STUDENTS’ USE OF MARIJUANA ON SCHOOL PROPERTY AND ANYWHERE
In 2005, some 20 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported using marijuana
anywhere during the past 30 days, and 5 percent reported using marijuana on
school property.
In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9–12 were asked whether they had
used marijuana at all during the past 30 days (referred to as “anywhere” in this report) and
whether they had used marijuana on school property during this period. In 2005, some 20
percent of students in grades 9–12 reported using marijuana anywhere during the past 30
days, and 5 percent reported using marijuana on school property (table 15.1).
The percentage of students who reported using marijuana anywhere increased between
1993 and 1995 (from 18 to 25 percent), and in 1995, 1997, and 1999, roughly one-quarter of students reported using marijuana anywhere (between 25 and 27 percent). By 2005,
however, the percentage of students who reported using marijuana anywhere had declined
to 20 percent. The percentage of students who reported using marijuana on school property
increased from 6 to 9 percent between 1993 and 1995 and then declined to 5 percent in
2001. No measurable change was found in the percentage of students who reported using
marijuana during the past 30 days on school property between 2001 and 2005.
Both students’ sex and grade level were associated with the use of marijuana among those
in grades 9–12. Males were more likely than females to have reported using marijuana
during the past 30 days in every survey year, both anywhere and on school property (ﬁgure 15.1 and table 15.1). For example, in 2005, some 6 percent of males and 3 percent of
females reported using marijuana on school property. In that same year, 9th-grade students
were less likely than 11th- and 12th-grade students to report using marijuana anywhere (ﬁgure 15.2 and table 15.1). While it appears that 9th-grade students were slightly more likely
to report using marijuana on school property than were their peers in other grades, no measurable differences were detected in student reports of using marijuana on school property
by grade level.

In 2005, Asian students were less likely than students from other racial/ethnic groups, except Paciﬁc Islander students, to report using marijuana anywhere (7 vs. 17–30 percent of

anywhere (30 vs. 7–20 percent of students in other racial/ethnic groups). At school, Hispanic students (8 percent) and American Indian students (9 percent) were more likely to report
using marijuana than were White or Black students (4 and 5 percent, respectively).
In 2005, the percentage of students who reported using marijuana varied among states for

STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF PERSONAL SAFETY AT SCHOOL AND AWAY
FROM SCHOOL
In 2005, as grade level increased, the percentage of students reporting fear of an
attack at school or on the way to and from school decreased.

School violence can make students fearful and affect their readiness and ability to learn, and
concerns about vulnerability to attacks detract from a positive school environment (Scheckner et al. 2002). In the School Crime Supplement22 to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked how often they had been afraid of attack “at school or
on the way to and from school” and “away from school” during the previous 6 months.23
In 2005, approximately 6 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they were afraid of
attack or harm at school, and 5 percent reported that they were afraid of attack or harm
away from school. There was no measurable change between 2003 and 2005 in the percentage of students reporting fear of attack or harm at or away from school (ﬁgure 16.1
and table 16.1). Consistent with ﬁndings from 1999 and 2001, students in 2005 were more
likely to report being afraid of an attack at school than away from school. The percentage
of students who reported that they were afraid of being attacked at school (including on the
way to and from school) decreased from 12 to 6 percent between 1995 and 2001; however,
no measurable difference was detected between 2001 and 2005. Similarly, there was no
change in the percentage of students who feared such an attack away from school between
1999 and 2005.
Black and Hispanic students were more likely than White students to fear for their safety regardless of location in 2005 (ﬁgure 16.2 and table 16.1). Nine percent of Black students and
10 percent of Hispanic students reported that they were afraid of being attacked at school
(including on the way to and from school), compared with 4 percent of White students.
Away from school, 7 percent of Black students, 6 percent of Hispanic students, and 4 percent of White students reported that they were afraid of an attack. There was no measurable
change between 2003 and 2005 in the percentage of students who feared for their safety in
either location among White, Black, or Hispanic students.
In 2005, as grade level increased, students’ fear of an attack at school or on the way to and
from school decreased. In the same year, 10 percent of 6th-graders, 6 percent of 9th-graders,
and 3 percent of 12th-graders feared for their safety at school or on the way to and from school.

to include 2005
data.

School location was also related to students’ fear of attack. In 2005, students in urban schools
were more likely than students in suburban and rural schools to fear being attacked at school
or on the way to and from school. Ten percent of students in urban schools feared being attacked at school, compared with 5 percent each of their peers in suburban and rural schools.
School sector was also related to students’ fear of attack. In every survey year, students in
public schools were more likely than students in private schools to fear being attacked at
school. In 2005, about 6 percent of public school students feared being attacked at school,
compared with 4 percent of private school students. While it appears that the public school
students were generally more likely than their counterparts in private schools to fear being
attacked away from school, these differences were not found to be statistically signiﬁcant.

STUDENTS’ REPORTS OF AVOIDING SCHOOL ACTIVITIES OR SPECIFIC
PLACES IN SCHOOL
In 2005, some 6 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they avoided school
activities or one or more places in school because they thought someone might
attack or harm them.
School crime may lead students to perceive school as unsafe, and in trying to ensure their
own safety, students may begin to skip school activities or avoid certain places within school
(Schreck and Miller 2003). The percentage of students who avoid school activities and certain areas in school is a measure of their perceptions of school safety. In the School Crime
Supplement24 to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked
whether they had avoided school activities or one or more places in school because they
were fearful that someone might attack or harm them.25 In 2005, some 6 percent of students
reported that they had avoided a school activity or one or more places in school in the previous 6 months because of fear of attack or harm: 2 percent of students avoided a school
activity, and 4 percent avoided one or more places in school26 (ﬁgure 17.1 and table 17.1).
The percentage of students ages 12–18 who reported that they avoided school activities because they thought someone might attack or harm them there decreased from 3 to 2 percent
between 1999 and 2001 and remained at about 2 percent through 2005 (ﬁgure 17.1 and
table 17.1). Between 4 and 5 percent of students reported avoiding one or more places in
school during the same period.
Students’ reports of avoiding one or more places in school varied according to their race/ethnicity. In 2005, Black and Hispanic students (7 and 6 percent, respectively) were more likely
than White students or those from some Other racial/ethnic background (4 and 3 percent, respectively) to report avoiding one or more places in school because they were afraid someone might attack or harm them (table 17.2). As in all previous survey years, no measurable
difference was detected in the extent to which males and females avoided places in 2005.
Generally, grade level was inversely associated with students’ likelihood of avoiding one or
more places in school. Eight percent of 6th-graders avoided one or more places in school in
2005, compared with 1 percent of 12th-graders (ﬁgure 17.2 and table 17.2).

This indicator has
been updated
to include 2005
data.

Consistent with most previous years, students in urban areas in 2005 were the most likely
to avoid places in school: 6 percent of urban students reported that they had done so, compared with 4 percent of suburban and rural students. In addition, public school students
were more likely than private school students to avoid places in school (5 vs. 1 percent).

SERIOUS DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS TAKEN BY PUBLIC SCHOOLS
About 46 percent of public schools (approximately 36,800 schools) took a serious
disciplinary action against a student for specific offenses during the 2003–04
school year. Of those disciplinary actions, 74 percent were suspensions lasting 5
days or more, 5 percent were removals with no services (i.e., expulsions), and 21
percent were transfers to specialized schools.
Removing a student from school because of behavior problems stemming from crime and
violence has a serious impact on the instruction of students. In the School Survey on Crime
and Safety, public school ofﬁcials were asked to report the number of disciplinary actions
their schools took against students for speciﬁc offenses during the 2003–04 school year.
About 46 percent of public schools took at least one serious disciplinary action against
a student—including suspensions lasting 5 days or more, removals with no services (i.e.,
expulsions), and transfers to specialized schools—for speciﬁc offenses during the 2003–04
school year (table 18.1). The offenses included physical attacks or ﬁghts; insubordination;
distribution, possession, or use of alcohol; distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs;
use or possession of a weapon other than a ﬁrearm; and use or possession of a ﬁrearm or
explosive device. Altogether, about 655,700 serious disciplinary actions were taken against
students for these offenses in 2003–04. Of those actions, 74 percent were suspensions for 5
days or more, 5 percent were removals with no services, and 21 percent were transfers to
specialized schools (ﬁgure 18.1 and table 18.1).
Four percent of all public schools took one or more serious disciplinary actions in response
to students’ use or possession of a ﬁrearm or explosive device (ﬁgure 18.2 and table 18.1).
Students’ use or possession of weapons other than ﬁrearms resulted in at least one serious
disciplinary action in 17 percent of schools. Thirty-two percent of public schools took at
least one serious disciplinary action for a physical attack or ﬁght, and 22 percent responded
to insubordination with a serious disciplinary action. Nine percent of all public schools took
one or more serious disciplinary actions for students’ distribution, possession, or use of alcohol, and 21 percent did so for the distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs.

SAFETY AND SECURITY MEASURES TAKEN BY PUBLIC SCHOOLS
In the 2003–04 school year, 28 percent of primary schools, 42 percent of middle
schools, and 60 percent of high schools used one or more security cameras to
monitor the school.
Public schools use a variety of practices and procedures intended to promote the safety of
students and staff. This indicator provides information on what types of safety and security
measures schools use and how frequently they use them. In the School Survey on Crime
and Safety, public school ofﬁcials were asked about their school’s use of such measures and
procedures during the 2003–04 school year. Certain practices, such as locked or monitored
doors or gates, are intended to limit or control access to school campuses, while others,
such as metal detectors, security cameras, and drug sweeps, are intended to monitor or restrict students’ and visitors’ behavior on campus.
In the 2003–04 school year, some 83 percent of public schools controlled access to school
buildings by locking or monitoring doors during school hours, and 36 percent controlled
access to school grounds with locked or monitored gates (table 19.1). Nearly all public
schools required visitors to sign or check in when entering the school building (98 percent),
while few schools required either students or visitors to pass through metal detectors daily
(1 percent each).

This indicator has
been updated
with 2003–04
data.

The use of security measures varied by school level. Primary schools were generally less
likely than middle schools, and middle schools generally less likely than high schools, to
report using most of these measures. About 48 percent of public schools required faculty
and staff to wear badges or picture IDs, compared with 6 percent of schools that required
students to do so (3 percent of primary schools, 11 percent of middle schools, and 16 percent of high schools; ﬁgure 19.1 and table 19.1). Six percent of public schools required
clear book bags or banned book bags altogether, but the use of this speciﬁc practice also
varied by school level, with 3 percent of primary schools, 13 percent of middle schools, and
9 percent of high schools using it. In the 2003–04 school year, some 28 percent of primary
schools, 42 percent of middle schools, and 60 percent of secondary schools used one or
more security cameras to monitor the school. About 13 percent of high schools reported
performing one or more random metal detector checks on students, 59 percent reported using one or more random dog sniffs to check for drugs, and 28 percent reported performing
one or more random sweeps for contraband, not including dog sniffs. In comparison, between 3 and 5 percent of primary schools reported using these security measures.
The use of these practices also varied by school size, location, and other school characteristics. For example, in 2003–04, schools with enrollments of 1,000 students or more were
more likely than schools with smaller enrollments to use random dog sniffs to check for
drugs (40 vs. 16–21 percent), random sweeps for contraband (24 vs. 8–14 percent), and security cameras to monitor the school (55 vs. 26–37 percent; table 19.1).

NOTE: Either school principals or the person most knowledgeable about discipline issues at school completed the SSOCS questionnaire. Primary schools
are deﬁned as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3
and the highest grade is not higher than grade 8. Middle schools are deﬁned
as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the high-

est grade is not higher than grade 9. High schools are deﬁned as schools in
which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9. Combined schools include
all other combinations of grades, including K–12 schools. Respondents were
instructed to respond only for those times that were during normal school
hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the survey
speciﬁed otherwise. Population size is 80,500 public schools.

STUDENTS’ REPORTS OF SAFETY AND SECURITY MEASURES
OBSERVED AT SCHOOL
The percentage of students who observed the use of security cameras at their
schools increased from 39 to 58 percent between 2001 and 2005.

Schools use a variety of measures to promote the safety of students, ranging from codes of
student conduct to metal detectors. However, research suggests that aggressive use of some
security measures in schools can alienate students, increase distrust and misbehavior among
students, and disrupt the school environment by interfering with learning (Beger 2003). In
the School Crime Supplement27 to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages
12–18 were asked whether their school used certain security measures.28 Security measures
include metal detectors, locker checks, security cameras, security guards or police ofﬁcers,
adult supervision in hallways, badges or picture identiﬁcation for students, a code of student
conduct, locked entrance or exit doors during the day, and a requirement that visitors sign
in. In 2005, nearly all (99 percent) students ages 12–18 observed the use of at least one of
the selected security measures at their school (table 20.1).
In 2005, the vast majority of students ages 12–18 reported that their school had a student
code of conduct (95 percent) and a requirement that visitors sign in (93 percent; ﬁgure 20.1
and table 20.1). Ninety percent of students reported observing school staff or other adult
supervision in the hallway, and 68 percent reported the presence of security guards and/or
assigned police ofﬁcers. Between 53 and 58 percent of students reported locker checks,
locked entrance or exit doors during the day, and security cameras at their schools. Onequarter of students reported that badges or picture identiﬁcation were required. Metal detectors were the least observed of the selected safety and security measures: 11 percent of
students reported the use of metal detectors at their school.

This indicator has
been updated
to include 2005
data.
•••

The percentage of students reporting the presence of many of the selected security measures
increased between 2001 and 2005 (ﬁgure 20.1 and table 20.1). For example, the percentage
of students who observed the use of security cameras at their schools increased from 39 to
58 percent during this period, and the percentage who reported that stude ts were required
to wear badges or picture identiﬁcation increased from 21 to 25 percent. Between 1999 and
2005, there was also an increase in the percentage of students observing locked entrance or
exit doors during the day (from 38 to 54 percent), the percentage reporting a visitor sign-in
requirement (from 87 to 93 percent), and the percentage reporting the presence of security
guards and/or assigned police ofﬁcers (from 54 to 68 percent). No differences were detected
in the percentage of students reporting locker checks or a code of student conduct in their
schools across all survey years.

In 2005, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret
the data with caution. For more information, please see appendix A.
28 Readers should note that this indicator relies on student reports of security measures and provides estimates
based on students’ awareness of the measure rather than on documented practice. See Indicator 19 for a summary of the use of various security measures as reported by schools.

Serious violent crimes are also included in violent crimes.

Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, and, from 2003 onward, more than one race. For this report, non-Hispanic students who identified themselves as
more than one race were included in the Other category. Respondents who identified themselves as being of Hispanic origin are classified as Hispanic, regardless of their race. Due to
changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.
NOTE: Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and completed thefts except motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include
robbery in which threat or use of force is involved. Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and
simple assault. Total crimes include violent crimes and theft. “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from
school. In 2005, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. For more information, please see appendix A.
Population sizes for students ages 12–18 are 23,325,000 in 1995; 24,614,000 in 1999; 24,315,000 in 2001; 25,684,000 in 2003; and 25,811,000 in 2005.

The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995, and 1997, Asian students and Pacific
Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing more than one race.
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 and 2002 (NCES 2006-030 and 2003-060) for students in
grades 9–12 are 13,093,000 students in 1993; 13,697,000 in 1995; 14,272,000 in 1997; 14,623,000 in 1999; 15,061,000 in 2001; 15,723,000 in 2003; and 16,286,000 (projected) in 2005.

The questionnaire wording for possession of a knife or sharp object changed between 1999–2000 and 2003–04. In 1999–2000, the question asked about possession of a knife or sharp

object. In 2003–04, the question was changed to refer to possession of a knife or sharp object with intent to harm.
NOTE: Either school principals or the person most knowledgeable about discipline issues at school completed the SSOCS questionnaire. “At school” was defined for respondents to include
activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to respond only
for those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified otherwise. Population size of public schools is 82,000
in 1999–2000 and 80,500 in 2003–04. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Estimates of number of incidents and schools are rounded to the nearest 100.

more than one race were included in the Other category. Respondents who identified themselves as being of Hispanic origin are classified as Hispanic, regardless of their race. Due to
changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.
NOTE: All gangs, whether or not they are involved in violent or illegal activity, are included. “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and

The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995, and 1997, Asian students and Pacific
Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing more than one race.
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 and 2002 (NCES 2006-030 and 2003-060) for students in
grades 9–12 are 13,093,000 students in 1993; 13,697,000 in 1995; 14,272,000 in 1997; 14,623,000 in 1999; 15,061,000 in 2001; 15,723,000 in 2003; and 16,286,000 (projected) in 2005.

In the School Crime Supplement (SCS) questionnaire, students were asked if they had been the target of hate-related words at school. Students who indicated that they had been called a
hate-related word were asked to choose the specific characteristics that the hate-related word targeted. Students were allowed to choose more than one characteristic. If a student chose
more than one characteristic, he or she is counted once under the “total” category. Therefore, the total percentage of students who reported being called a hate-related word is less than the
sum of the students’ individual characteristics.

NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. Bullying types do not sum to total because students could have
experienced more than one type of bullying. In 2005, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. For more

The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995, and 1997, Asian students and Pacific
Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing more than one race.
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are simply asked how many times in the last 12
months they have been in a physical fight. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 and 2002 (NCES 2006-030 and 2003-060) for students in grades 9–12 are
13,093,000 students in 1993; 13,697,000 in 1995; 14,272,000 in 1997; 14,623,000 in 1999; 15,061,000 in 2001; 15,723,000 in 2003; and 16,286,000 (projected) in 2005.

On school property

— Not available.
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are simply asked how many times in the last 12
months they had been in a physical fight. The estimate for the United States is drawn from a nationally representative sample of schools and is not the aggregate of participating states. Each
state estimate is based on a sample that is representative of that state. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 (NCES 2006-030) for students in grades 9–12 are
15,723,000 in 2003 and 16,286,000 (projected) in 2005.

The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995, and 1997, Asian students and Pacific
Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing more than one race.
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are simply asked how many days they carried a
weapon during the past 30 days. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 and 2002 (NCES 2006-030 and 2003-060) for students in grades 9–12 are 13,093,000 students
in 1993; 13,697,000 in 1995; 14,272,000 in 1997; 14,623,000 in 1999; 15,061,000 in 2001; 15,723,000 in 2003; and 16,286,000 (projected) in 2005.

American Indian includes Alaska Native, Black includes African American, Pacific Islander includes Native Hawaiian, and Hispanic includes Latino. Respondents who identified
themselves as being of Hispanic origin are classified as Hispanic, regardless of their race.

The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995, and 1997, Asian students and Pacific
Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing more than one race.
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are simply asked how many days did they have
at least one drink of alcohol during the past 30 days. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 and 2002 (NCES 2006-030 and 2003-060) for students in grades 9–12 are
13,093,000 students in 1993; 13,697,000 in 1995; 14,272,000 in 1997; 14,623,000 in 1999; 15,061,000 in 2001; 15,723,000 in 2003; and 16,286,000 (projected) in 2005.

American Indian includes Alaska Native, Black includes African American, Pacific Islander includes Native Hawaiian, and Hispanic includes Latino. Respondents who identified
themselves as being of Hispanic origin are classified as Hispanic, regardless of their race.

NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are simply asked how many days did they have
at least one drink of alcohol during the past 30 days. The estimate for the United States is drawn from a nationally representative sample of schools and is not the aggregate of participating
states. Each state estimate is based on a sample that is representative of that state. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 (NCES 2006-030) for students in grades 9–12
are 15,723,000 in 2003 and 16,286,000 (projected) in 2005.

NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are simply asked how many times during the
past 30 days they used marijuana. The estimate for the United States is drawn from a nationally representative sample of schools and is not the aggregate of participating states. Each state
estimate is based on a sample that is representative of that state. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 (NCES 2006-030) for students in grades 9–12 are 15,723,000
in 2003 and 16,286,000 (projected) in 2005.

more than one race were included in the Other category. Respondents who identified themselves as being of Hispanic origin are classified as Hispanic, regardless of their race. Due to
changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. For the 2001 survey, the wording was changed
from “attack or harm” to “attack or threat of attack.” Includes students who reported that they sometimes or most of the time feared being victimized in this way. Fear of attack away from
school was not collected in 1995. In 2005, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. For more information,
please see appendix A. Population sizes for students ages 12–18 are 23,325,000 in 1995; 24,614,000 in 1999; 24,315,000 in 2001; 25,684,000 in 2003; and 25,811,000 in 2005.

A firearm or explosive device was defined for respondents as “any weapon that is designed to (or may readily be converted to) expel a projectile by the action of an explosive. This

A weapon was defined for respondents as “any instrument or object used with the intent to threaten, injure, or kill. Includes look-alikes if they are used to threaten others.”

includes guns, bombs, grenades, mines, rockets, missiles, pipe bombs, or similar devices designed to explode and capable of causing bodily harm or property damage.”
NOTE: Either school principals or the person most knowledgeable about discipline issues at school completed the SSOCS questionnaire. Serious disciplinary actions include removals with
no continuing services for at least the remainder of the school year, transfers to specialized schools for disciplinary reasons, and out-of-school suspensions lasting 5 or more days, but less
than the remainder of the school year. Respondents were instructed to respond only for those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session,
unless the survey specified otherwise. Population size is 80,500 public schools. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Estimates of number of actions and schools are rounded to
the nearest 100.

Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers and aides. The total number

These estimates exclude data from Tennessee because schools in this state did not report estimates of students by race/ethnicity.

of FTE teachers and aides is a combination of the full-time and part-time teachers and aides, including special education teachers and aides, with an adjustment for part-time status.
NOTE: Either school principals or the person most knowledgeable about discipline issues at school completed the SSOCS questionnaire. Respondents were instructed to respond only for
those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified otherwise. Population size is 80,500 public schools.

NOTE: Either school principals or the person most knowledgeable about discipline issues at school completed the SSOCS questionnaire. “At school” was defined for respondents to include
activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to respond only
for those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified otherwise. Population size is 80,500 public schools.
Standard errors of number of incidents and schools are rounded to the nearest 10.

months they have been in a physical fight. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 and 2002 (NCES 2006-030 and 2003-060) for students in grades 9–12 are

NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are simply asked how many days did they have
at least one drink of alcohol during the past 30 days. The estimate for the United States is drawn from a nationally representative sample of schools and is not the aggregate of participating
states. Each state estimate is based on a sample that is representative of that state. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 (NCES 2006-030) for students in grades 9–12

NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are simply asked how many times during the
past 30 days they used marijuana. The estimate for the United States is drawn from a nationally representative sample of schools and is not the aggregate of participating states. Each state
estimate is based on a sample that is representative of that state. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 (NCES 2006-030) for students in grades 9–12 are 15,723,000
in 2003 and 16,286,000 (projected) in 2005.

NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. For the 2001 survey, the wording was changed
from “attack or harm” to “attack or threat of attack.” Includes students who reported that they sometimes or most of the time feared being victimized in this way. Fear of attack away from
school was not collected in 1995. In 2005, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. For more information,
please see appendix A. Population sizes for students ages 12–18 are 23,325,000 in 1995; 24,614,000 in 1999; 24,315,000 in 2001; 25,684,000 in 2003; and 25,811,000 in 2005.

TECHNICAL NOTES

GENERAL INFORMATION
The indicators in this report are based on information drawn from a variety of independent data sources, including national surveys of students, teachers, and principals,
and data collections from federal departments and agencies, including the Bureau of
Justice Statistics, the National Center for Education Statistics, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each data source has
an independent sample design, data collection method, and questionnaire design or is
the result of a universe data collection. Universe data collections include a census of
all known entities in a speciﬁc universe (e.g., all deaths occurring on school property).
Readers should be cautious when comparing data from different sources. Differences
in sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and question phrasing can all affect
the comparability of results. For example, some questions from different surveys may
appear the same, but were asked of different populations of students (e.g., students
ages 12–18 or students in grades 9–12); in different years; about experiences that occurred within different periods of time (e.g., in the past 30 days or during the past 12
months); or at different locations (e.g., in school or anywhere).
The following is a description of data sources, accuracy of estimates, and statistical
procedures used in this report.

SOURCES

OF

DATA

This section brieﬂy describes each of the datasets used in this report: the School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study, the Supplementary Homicide Reports, the
Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System Fatal, the National Crime Victimization Survey, the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization
Survey, the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the Schools and Stafﬁng Survey, and the School
Survey on Crime and Safety. Directions for obtaining more information are provided at
the end of each description. Figure A.1 presents some key information for each of the
datasets used in the report, including the survey year(s), target population, response
rate, and sample size. The wording of the interview questions used to construct the indicators are presented in ﬁgure A.2. (Figures appear at the end of appendix A.)

School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study (SAVD)
The School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study (SAVD) is an epidemiological
study developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in conjunction with
the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice. SAVD seeks to
describe the epidemiology of school-associated violent deaths, identify common features of these deaths, estimate the rate of school-associated violent deaths in the United
States, and identify potential risk factors for these deaths. The surveillance system includes descriptive data on all school-associated violent deaths in the United States,

including all homicides, suicides, and unintentional ﬁrearm-related deaths where the
fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school,
while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at such a school, or while
attending or on the way to or from an ofﬁcial school-sponsored event. Victims of such
events include nonstudents as well as students and staff members. SAVD includes descriptive information about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). The SAVD Surveillance System has collected data from July 1, 1992, through the present.
SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and collect data on school-associated violent
deaths. Cases are initially identiﬁed through a search of the Lexis/Nexis newspaper and
media database. Then police ofﬁcials are contacted to conﬁrm the details of the case
and to determine if the event meets the case deﬁnition. Once a case is conﬁrmed, a
police ofﬁcial and a school ofﬁcial are interviewed regarding details about the school,
event, victim(s), and offender(s). A copy of the full police report is also sought for each
case. The information obtained on schools includes school demographics, attendance/
absentee rates, suspension/expulsions and mobility, school history of weapon-carrying
incidents, security measures, violence prevention activities, school response to the event,
and school policies about weapon carrying. Event information includes the location of
injury, the context of injury (while classes were being held, during break, etc.), motives
for injury, method of injury, and school and community events happening around the
time period. Information obtained on victim(s) and offender(s) includes demographics,
circumstances of the event (date/time, alcohol or drug use, number of persons involved),
types and origins of weapons, criminal history, psychological risk factors, school-related
problems, extracurricular activities, and family history, including structure and stressors.
One hundred ﬁve school-associated violent deaths were identiﬁed from July 1, 1992–
June 30, 1994 (Kachur et al. 1996). A more recent report from this data collection identiﬁed 253 school-associated violent deaths between July 1, 1994–June 30, 1999 (Anderson et al. 2001). Other publications from this study have described how the number
of events changes during the school year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
2001), the source of the ﬁrearms used in these events (Reza et al. 2003), and suicides
that were associated with schools (Kauffman et al. 2004). The interviews conducted on
cases between July 1, 1994 and June 30, 1999 achieved a response rate of 97 percent
for police ofﬁcials and 78 percent for school ofﬁcials. Data for subsequent study years
are preliminary and subject to change. The SAVD data are considered preliminary until
interviews with school and law enforcement ofﬁcials have been completed. The details
learned during the interviews can occasionally change the classiﬁcation of a case. For

Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR)
The Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), which are a part of the Uniform Crime
Reporting (UCR) program, provide incident-level information on criminal homicides
including situation (number of victims to number of offenders); the age, sex, and race
of victims and offenders; types of weapons used; circumstances of the incident; and the
relationship of the victim to the offender. The data are provided monthly to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) by local law enforcement agencies participating in the
FBI’s UCR program. The data include murders and non-negligent manslaughters in the
United States from January 1976–December 2004; that is, negligent manslaughters and
justiﬁable homicides have been eliminated from the data. Based on law enforcement
agency reports, the FBI estimates that 561,412 murders were committed from 1976 to
2004. Agencies provided detailed information on 574,574 victims and 640,722 offenders.
About 91 percent of homicides are included in the SHR. However, adjustments can be
made to the weights to correct for missing reports. Estimates from the SHR used in this
report were generated by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) using a weight developed
by BJS that reconciles the counts of SHR homicide victims with those in the UCR for
the 1992 through 2004 data years. The weight is the same for all cases for a given year.
The weight represents the ratio of the number of homicides reported in the UCR to the
number reported in the SHR. For additional information about SHR, contact:

Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System Fatal
(WISQARS(™)Fatal)
WISQARS Fatal provides mortality data related to injury. The mortality data reported
in WISQARS Fatal come from death certiﬁcate data reported to the National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data include
causes of death reported by attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners. It
also includes demographic information about decedents reported by funeral directors,
who obtain that information from family members and other informants. NCHS collects, compiles, veriﬁes, and prepares these data for release to the public. The data provide information about what types of injuries are leading causes of deaths, how common they are, and who they affect. These data are intended for a broad audience—the
public, the media, public health practitioners and researchers, and public health ofﬁcials—to increase their knowledge of injury.

National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), administered for the U.S. Bureau of
Justice Statistics by the U.S. Census Bureau, is the nation’s primary source of information on crime and the victims of crime. Initiated in 1972 and redesigned in 1992, the
NCVS collects detailed information annually on the frequency and nature of the crimes
of rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, theft, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft experienced by Americans and their households each
year. The survey measures crimes reported to police as well.
Readers should note that in 2003, in accordance with changes to the Ofﬁce of Management and Budget’s standards for the classiﬁcation of federal data on race and ethnicity, the NCVS item on race/ethnicity was modiﬁed. A question on Hispanic origin
is followed by a question on race. The new race question allows the respondent to
choose more than one race and delineates Asian as a separate category from Native
Hawaiian or Other Paciﬁc Islander. Analysis conducted by the Demographic Surveys
Division at the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the new race question had very little
impact on the aggregate racial distribution of the NCVS respondents, with one exception. There was a 1.6 percentage point decrease in the percent of respondents who reported themselves as White. Due to changes in race/ethnicity categories, comparisons
of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.
The indicator from NCVS related to nonfatal teacher victimization at school has been
discontinued. Because of sample cuts to the NCVS and declining victimization rates,
the survey’s capacity to provide useful estimates of teacher victimization has diminished, especially for disaggregated subcategories of teacher characteristics. The indicator has been determined to no longer be an adequate measure of teacher victimization.
The number of NCVS eligible households in 2004 was about 46,200. They were selected using a stratiﬁed, multistage cluster design. In the ﬁrst stage, the primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties or groups of counties, were selected. In the
second stage, smaller areas, called Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected from
each sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs, clusters of four households, called segments, were selected for interview. At each stage, the selection was done proportion162

ate to population size in order to create a self-weighting sample. The ﬁnal sample was
augmented to account for housing units constructed after the decennial Census. Within
each sampled household, U.S. Census Bureau personnel interviewed all household
members age 12 and older to determine whether they had been victimized by the
measured crimes during the 6 months preceding the interview.
The ﬁrst NCVS interview with a housing unit is conducted in person. Subsequent interviews are conducted by telephone, if possible. About 74,300 persons age 12 and older
are interviewed every 6 months. Households remain in the sample for 3 years and
are interviewed seven times at 6-month intervals. The initial interview at each sample
unit is used only to bound future interviews to establish a time frame to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered in these subsequent interviews. After their seventh interview,
households are replaced by new sample households. The NCVS has consistently obtained a response rate of over 90 percent at the household level. The completion rates
for persons within households were about 86 percent. Thus, ﬁnal response rates were

School Crime Supplement (SCS)
Created as a supplement to the NCVS and codesigned by the National Center for Education Statistics and Bureau of Justice Statistics, the School Crime Supplement (SCS)
survey was conducted in 1989, 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 to collect additional information about school-related victimizations on a national level. This report includes data from the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 collections. The 1989 data are
not included in this report as a result of methodological changes to the NCVS and SCS.
The survey was designed to assist policymakers as well as academic researchers and
practitioners at the federal, state, and local levels so that they can make informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The SCS asks students a number of key questions
about their experiences with and perceptions of crime and violence that occurred inside their school, on school grounds, on a school bus, or on the way to or from school.
Additional questions not included in the NCVS were also added to the SCS, such as
those concerning preventive measures used by the school, students’ participation in
after school activities, students’ perceptions of school rules, the presence of weapons
and gangs in school, the presence of hate-related words and grafﬁti in school, student
reports of bullying and reports of rejection at school, and the availability of drugs and

alcohol in school, as well as attitudinal questions relating to fear of victimization and
avoidance behavior at school.
In all SCS survey years, the SCS was conducted for a 6-month period from January–June in all households selected for the NCVS (see discussion above for information
about the NCVS sampling design and changes to the race/ethnicity item made for 2003
onward). It should be noted that the initial NCVS interview is included in the SCS data
collection. Within these households, the eligible respondents for the SCS were those
household members who had attended school at any time during the 6 months preceding the interview, were enrolled in grades 6–12, and were not home schooled. The
age range of students covered in this report is 12–18 years of age. Eligible respondents
were asked the supplemental questions in the SCS only after completing their entire
NCVS interview.
The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 was calculated
by using NCVS incident variables appended to the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005
SCS data ﬁles. The NCVS type of crime variable was used to classify victimizations
of students in the SCS as serious violent, violent, or theft. The NCVS variables asking
where the incident happened and what the victim was doing when it happened were
used to ascertain whether the incident happened at school. For prevalence of victimization, the NCVS deﬁnition of “at school” includes in the school building, on school
property, or on the way to or from school. Only incidents that occurred inside the
United States are included.
In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modiﬁed from previous collections in three
ways. First, in 1995 and 1999, “at school” was deﬁned for respondents as in the school
building, on the school grounds, or on a school bus. In 2001, the deﬁnition for “at
school” was changed to mean in the school building, on school property, on a school
bus, or going to and from school. This change was made to the 2001 questionnaire in
order to be consistent with the deﬁnition of “at school” as it is constructed in the NCVS
and was also used as the deﬁnition in 2003 and 2005. Cognitive interviews conducted
by the U.S. Census Bureau on the 1999 SCS suggested that modiﬁcations to the deﬁnition of “at school” would not have a substantial impact on the estimates.
Second, the SCS questions pertaining to fear and avoidance were changed for the 2001
SCS survey. In 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2005, students were asked if they were fearful
or avoidant because they thought someone would “attack or harm” them. In 2001, students were asked if they were fearful or avoidant because they thought someone would
“attack or threaten to attack” them. In the 1999 and 2001 SCS, students were asked
to exclude times they were at school or going to or from school in the question about
fear away from school. In 2003 and 2005, when asked about fear away from school,
students were asked to exclude times they were at school; however, in these years the
deﬁnition of “at school” included going to and from school. These changes should be
considered when making comparisons across survey years.

Third, the SCS question pertaining to gangs changed beginning with the 2001 SCS.
The introduction and deﬁnition of gangs as well as the placement of the item in the
questionnaire changed in the 2001 SCS. Because of these changes, the reader should
be cautioned not to compare results from 2001 onwards (presented in this report) with
estimates of gang presence in 1995 and 1999 (presented in previous editions of this
report).
In 2005, the SCS instrument was modiﬁed again. In this year, the SCS question(s) pertaining to bullying changed. In 1999, 2001, and 2003, students were asked a single
bullying question. The 2005 SCS included a series of questions about bullying. Because
of substantive changes in questionnaire wording, comparisons between the 2005 SCS
bullying indicator and all other survey years should be made with caution.
Total victimization is a combination of violent victimization and theft. If the student reported an incident of either violent or theft victimization or both, he or she is counted
as having experienced “total” victimization. Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual
assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes include serious violent crimes
and simple assault. Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and completed thefts except motor vehicle
thefts.
A total of 9,728 students participated in the 1995 SCS, 8,398 in 1999, 8,374 in 2001,
7,152 in 2003, and 6,297 in 2005. In the 2005 SCS, the household completion rate
was 91 percent. In the 1995, 1999, 2001 and 2003 SCS, the household completion
rates were 95 percent, 94 percent, 93 percent, and 92 percent, respectively; and the
student completion rates were 78 percent, 78 percent, 77 percent, and 70 percent, respectively. For the 2005 SCS, the student completion rate was 62 percent.
Thus, the overall unweighted SCS response rate (calculated by multiplying the household completion rate by the student completion rate) was 74 percent in 1995, 73
percent in 1999, 72 percent in 2001, 64 percent in 2003, and 56 percent in 2005. Response rates for most survey items were high—typically over 95 percent of all eligible
respondents. The weights were developed to compensate for differential probabilities of
selection and nonresponse. The weighted data permit inferences about the eligible student population who were enrolled in schools in 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005.
Due to the low unit response rate in 2005, a unit nonresponse bias analysis was commissioned. There are two types of nonresponse: unit and item nonresponse. Unit response rates indicate how many sampled units have completed interviews. Because
interviews with students could only be completed after households had responded to
NCVS, the unit completion rate for SCS reﬂects both the household interview completion rate and the student interview completion rate.
Nonresponse can greatly affect the strength and application of survey data by leading
to an increase in variance as a result of a reduction in the actual size of the sample and

can produce bias if the nonrespondents have characteristics of interest that are different
from the respondents. Furthermore, imputation, a common recourse to nonresponse,
can lead to the risk of underestimating the sampling error if imputed data are treated as
though they were observed data.
In order for response bias to occur, respondents must have different response rates and
responses to particular survey variables. The magnitude of unit nonresponse bias is
determined by the response rate and the differences between respondents and nonrespondents on key survey variables. Although the bias analysis cannot measure response
bias since SCS is a sample survey and we do not know how the population would have
responded, the SCS sampling frame has four key student or school characteristic variables for which data is known for respondents and nonrespondents: sex, race/ethnicity,
household income, and urbanicity, all of which are associated with student victimization. To the extent that there are differential responses by respondents in these groups,
nonresponse bias is a concern.
The analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias for the race, household
income, and urbanicity variables. White, non-Hispanic and Other, non-Hispanic respondents had higher response rates than Black, non-Hispanic, and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households with an income of $35,000–49,999 and $50,000
or more had higher response rates than those from households with incomes of less
than $7,500, $7,500–14,999, $15,000–24,999, and $25,000–34,999. Respondents
who live in urban areas had lower response rates than those who live in rural or suburban areas. Although we cannot assess the extent of nonresponse bias, weighting
adjustments, which corrected for differential response rates, should have reduced the
problem. For more information about SCS, contact:

Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)
The National School-Based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) is one component of
the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), an epidemiological surveillance
system developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to monitor
the prevalence of youth behaviors that most inﬂuence health.1 The YRBS focuses on
priority health-risk behaviors established during youth that result in the most signiﬁcant
mortality, morbidity, disability, and social problems during both youth and adulthood.
This report uses 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 YRBS data.

The YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling design to produce a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9–12 in the United States. The target population
consisted of all public and private school students in grades 9–12 in the 50 states and
the District of Columbia. The ﬁrst-stage sampling frame included selecting primary
sampling units (PSUs) from strata formed on the basis of urbanization and the relative
percentage of Black and Hispanic students in the PSU. These PSUs are either large
counties or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. At the second stage, schools were selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size.
Schools with substantial numbers of Black and Hispanic students were sampled at
relatively higher rates than all other schools. The ﬁnal stage of sampling consisted of
randomly selecting within each chosen school at each grade 9–12 one or two intact
classes of a required subject, such as English or social studies. All students in selected
classes were eligible to participate. Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300,
13,600, 15,200, and 13,900 students participated in the 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999,
2001, 2003, and 2005 surveys, respectively.
The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993 survey, 60 percent for the 1995
survey, 69 percent for the 1997 survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey, 63 percent for
the 2001 survey, 67 percent for the 2003 survey, and 67 percent for the 2005 survey.
NCES standards call for response rates of 85 percent or better for cross-sectional surveys, and bias analyses are required by NCES when that percentage is not achieved.
For YRBS data, a full nonresponse bias analysis has not been done because the data
necessary to do the analysis are not available. The weights were developed to adjust
for nonresponse and the oversampling of Black and Hispanic students in the sample.
The ﬁnal weights were constructed so that only weighted proportions of students (not
weighted counts of students) in each grade matched national population projections.
Where YRBS data are presented, accurate national population projections are provided
from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2002 and 2005 (U.S. Department of Education
2003, 2006).
State level data were downloaded from the Youth Online: Comprehensive Results web
page (http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/yrbss/). Each state and local school-based YRBS employs
a two-stage, cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in
grades 9–12 in their jurisdiction. All except a few state and local samples include only
public schools, and each local sample includes only schools in the funded school district (e.g., San Diego Uniﬁed School District) rather than in the entire city (e.g., greater
San Diego area).
In the ﬁrst sampling stage in all except a few states and districts, schools are selected
with probability proportional to school enrollment size. In the second sampling stage,
intact classes of a required subject or intact classes during a required period (e.g.,
second period) are selected randomly. All students in sampled classes are eligible to
participate. Certain states and districts modify these procedures to meet their individual
needs. For example, in a given state or district, all schools, rather than a sample of
schools, might be selected to participate. State and local surveys that have a scientiﬁ-

cally selected sample, appropriate documentation, and an overall response rate greater
than or equal to 60 percent are weighted. The overall response rate reﬂects the school
response rate multiplied by the student response rate. These three criteria are used to
ensure that the data from those surveys can be considered representative of students
in grades 9–12 in that jurisdiction. A weight is applied to each record to adjust for
student nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade, sex, and race/ethnicity
in each jurisdiction. Therefore, weighted estimates are representative of all students in
grades 9–12 attending schools in each jurisdiction. Surveys that do not have an overall
response rate of greater than or equal to 60 percent and do not have appropriate documentation are not weighted and are not included in this report.
In 2005, a total of 40 states and 21 districts had weighted data. In sites with weighted
data, the student sample sizes for the state and local YRBS ranged from 942 to 9,708.
School response rates ranged from 72 to 100 percent, student response rates ranged
from 61 to 93 percent, and overall response rates ranged from 60 to 85 percent.
Readers should note that reports of these data published by the CDC do not include
percentages where the denominator includes less than 100 unweighted cases. However, NCES publications do not include percentages where the denominator includes less
than 30 unweighted cases. Therefore, estimates presented here may not appear in CDC
publications of YRBS estimates and are considered unstable by CDC standards.
In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Ofﬁce of Management and Budget’s standards for the classiﬁcation of federal data on race and ethnicity, the YRBS item on race/
ethnicity was modiﬁed. The version of the race and ethnicity question used in 1993,
1995, and 1997 was:
How do you describe yourself?
A. White - not Hispanic
B. Black - not Hispanic
C. Hispanic or Latino
D. Asian or Paciﬁc Islander
E. American Indian or Alaskan Native
F. Other
The version used in 1999, 2001, 2003, and in the 2005 state and local surveys was:
How do you describe yourself? (Select one or more responses.)
A. American Indian or Alaska Native
B. Asian
C. Black or African American
D. Hispanic or Latino
E. Native Hawaiian or Other Paciﬁc Islander
F. White
In the 2005 national survey, race/ethnicity was computed from two questions: 1) “Are
you Hispanic or Latino?” (response options were “yes” and “no”), and 2) “What is your

race?” (response options were “American Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian,” “Black or
African American,” “Native Hawaiian or Other Paciﬁc Islander,” or “White”). For the
second question, students could select more than one response option. For this report,
students were classiﬁed as “Hispanic” if they answered “yes” to the ﬁrst question, regardless of how they answered the second question. Students who answered “no” to
the ﬁrst question and selected more than one race/ethnicity in the second category
were classiﬁed as “More than one race.” Students who answered “no” to the ﬁrst question and selected only one race/ethnicity were classiﬁed as that race/ethnicity. Race/
ethnicity was set to missing for students who did not answer the ﬁrst question (176
cases) or for students who answered “no” to the ﬁrst question but did not answer the
second question (48 cases).
The questions used in 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 result in the possibility of respondents marking more than one category. While more accurately reﬂecting respondents’
racial and ethnic identity, the new item cannot be directly compared to responses to
the old item. Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found that allowing students to select
more than one response to the race/ethnicity question on the YRBS had only a minimal
effect on reported race/ethnicity among high school students. CDC is examining the effect of using a two-question format to assess race/ethnicity in the 2005 national YRBS.

Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS)
This report draws upon data on teacher victimization from the Schools and Stafﬁng
Survey (SASS), which provides national- and state-level data on public schools and
national- and afﬁliation-level data on private schools. The 1993–94, 1999–2000, and
2003–04 SASS were collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). SASS consists of four sets of linked surveys, including surveys of schools, the principals of each selected school, a subsample
of teachers within each school, and public school districts. In 1993–94, there were two
sets of teacher surveys, public and private school teachers. In 1999–2000, there were
four sets of teacher surveys, public, private, public charter, and Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA) school teachers. In 2003–04, there were three sets of teacher surveys, public (including public charter), private, and BIA. For this report, BIA and public charter schools
are included with public schools.

The public school sampling frames for the 1993–94, 1999–2000, and 2003–04 SASS
were created using the 1991–92, 1997–98, and 2001–02 NCES Common Core of Data
(CCD) Public School Universe Files, respectively. In SASS, a school was deﬁned as an
institution or part of an institution that provides classroom instruction to students; has
one or more teachers to provide instruction; serves students in one or more of grades
1–12 or the ungraded equivalent and is located in one or more buildings. It was possible for two or more schools to share the same building; in this case they were treated
as different schools if they had different administrations (i.e., principals). Since CCD
and SASS differ in scope and their deﬁnitions of a school, some records were deleted,
added, or modiﬁed in order to provide better coverage and a more efﬁcient sample
design for SASS. Data were collected by multistage sampling, which began with the
selection of schools.
This report uses 1993–94, 1999–2000, and 2003–04 SASS data. Approximately 10,000
public schools and 3,300 private schools were selected to participate in the 1993–94
SASS, 11,100 public schools (9,900 public schools, 100 BIA-funded schools, and
1,100 charter schools) and 3,600 private schools were selected to participate in the
1999–2000 SASS, and 10,400 public schools (10,200 public schools and 200 BIAfunded schools) and 3,600 private schools were selected to participate in the 2003–04
SASS. Within each school, teachers selected were further stratiﬁed into one of ﬁve
teacher types in the following hierarchy: (1) Asian or Paciﬁc Islander; (2) American Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; (3) teachers who teach classes designed for students with limited
English proﬁciency; (4) teachers in their ﬁrst, second, or third year of teaching; and (5)
teachers not classiﬁed in any of the other groups. Within each teacher stratum, teachers
were selected systematically with equal probability. In 1993–94, approximately 57,000
public school teachers and 11,500 private school teachers were sampled. In 1999–
2000, 56,300 public school teachers, 500 BIA teachers, 4,400 public charter school
teachers, and 10,800 private school teachers were sampled. In 2003–04, 52,500 public
school teachers, 700 BIA teachers, and 10,000 private school teachers were sampled.
This report focuses on responses from teachers. The overall weighted response rate for
public school teachers in 1993–94 was 88 percent. In 1999–2000, the overall weighted response rates were 77 percent for public school teachers, and 86 and 72 percent
for BIA and public charter school teachers, respectively (which are included with
public school teachers for this report). In 2003–2004, the overall weighted response
rates were 76 percent for public school teachers and 86 percent for BIA-funded school
teachers (who are included with public school teachers). For private school teachers,
the overall weighted response rates were 80 percent, 67 percent, and 70 percent in
1993–94, 1999–2000, and 2003–04, respectively. Values were imputed for questionnaire items that should have been answered but were not. For additional information

School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)
The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) was conducted by NCES in the winter
and spring of the 2003–04 school year. SSOCS focuses on incidents of speciﬁc crimes
and offenses and a variety of speciﬁc discipline issues in public schools. It also covers
characteristics of school policies, school violence prevention programs and policies,
and school characteristics that have been associated with school crime. The survey was
conducted with a nationally representative sample of regular public primary, middle,
high, and combined schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Special education, alternative and vocational schools, schools in the territories, and schools that
taught only prekindergarten, kindergarten, or adult education were not included in the
sample.
The sampling frame for the 2004 SSOCS was constructed from the public school universe ﬁle created for the 2003–04 Schools and Stafﬁng Survey (SASS) from the 2001–02
NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) Public School Universe File. The CCD is an annual national database of all public K–12 schools and school districts. Certain types
of schools were excluded from the CCD Public School Universe File in order to meet
the sampling needs of SASS, including those in the outlying U.S. territories,2 overseas
Department of Defense schools, newly closed schools, home schools, and schools with
high grades of kindergarten or lower. Additional schools were then excluded from the
SASS frame to meet the sampling needs of SSOCS, including; local education agencies
that appear to be schools, special education, vocational, or alternative schools, department of defense schools, Bureau of Indian Affairs schools, ungraded schools, and “intermediate units”3 in California and Pennsylvania. The sample was stratiﬁed by instructional level, type of locale (e.g., city, urban fringe, etc.), and enrollment size. Within
the primary strata, schools were also sorted by geographic region and by percentage of
minority enrollment. The sample was then allocated to the primary strata in rough proportion to the square root of the total sum of individual enrollments of schools within
the stratum. A total of 3,743 schools were selected for the study. In March 2004, questionnaires were mailed to school principals, who were asked to complete the survey or
to have it completed by the person most knowledgeable about discipline issues at the
school. A total of 2,772 schools completed the survey. The weighted overall response
rate was 77.2 percent, and weighted item nonresponse rates ranged from 0–33.3 percent. A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted on the nine items with weighted item

“U.S. outlying areas” include the following: America Samoa, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

ACCURACY

OF

ESTIMATES

The accuracy of any statistic is determined by the joint effects of nonsampling and
sampling errors. Both types of error affect the estimates presented in this report. Several
sources can contribute to nonsampling errors. For example, members of the population of interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling frame; sampled members
refuse to answer some of the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of the survey
questions (questionnaire nonresponse); mistakes are made during data editing, coding,
or entry; the responses that respondents provide differ from the “true” responses; or
measurement instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail to measure the characteristics they are intended to measure. Although nonsampling errors due to questionnaire
and item nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights
and imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors or gauging the effects of
these errors is usually difﬁcult.
Sampling errors occur because observations are made on samples rather than on entire populations. Surveys of population universes are not subject to sampling errors.
Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat from those that would have been
obtained by a complete census of the relevant population using the same survey instruments, instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a measure
of the variation due to sampling; it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in a
particular sample. In addition, the standard errors for two sample statistics can be used
to estimate the precision of the difference between the two statistics and to help determine whether the difference based on the sample is large enough so that it represents
the population difference.
Most of the data used in this report were obtained from complex sampling designs
rather than a simple random design. The features of complex sampling require different
techniques to calculate standard errors than are used for data collected using a simple
random sampling. Therefore, calculation of standard errors requires procedures that
are markedly different from the ones used when the data are from a simple random
sample. The Taylor series approximation technique or the balanced repeated replica172

tion (BRR) method was used to estimate most of the statistics and their standard errors
in this report. Figure A.3 lists the various methods used to compute standard errors for
different datasets.
Standard error calculation for data from the National Crime Victimization Survey and
the School Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series approximation method
using PSU and strata variables available from each dataset. For statistics based on all
years of NCVS data, standard errors were derived from a formula developed by the
U.S. Census Bureau, which consists of three generalized variance function (gvf) constant parameters that represent the curve ﬁtted to the individual standard errors calculated using the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique. The formulas used to compute the adjusted standard errors associated with percentages or population counts can
be found in ﬁgure A.3.
The coefﬁcient of variation (Cv) represents the ratio of the standard error to the mean.
As an attribute of a distribution, the Cv is an important measure of the reliability and
accuracy of an estimate. In this report, the Cv was calculated for all estimates, and in
cases where the Cv was at least 30 percent the estimates were noted with a ! symbol
(interpret data with caution). In cases where the Cv was greater than 50 percent, the estimate was determined not to meet reporting standards and was suppressed.

STATISTICAL PROCEDURES
The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical signiﬁcance to ensure that
the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Unless
otherwise noted, all statements cited in the report are statistically signiﬁcant at the .05
level. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the statement being tested. The primary test procedure used in
this report was the student’s t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample
estimates, for example, between males and females. The formula used to compute the t
statistic is as follows:

t =

E1 –E2

(1)

se1 2 +se22
where E1 and E2 are the estimates to be compared and se1 and se2 are their corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates are not independent (for example, when comparing a total
percentage with that for a subgroup included in the total), a covariance term (i.e.,
2*se1*se2) must be added to the denominator of the formula:
t =

E1 –E2

(2)

se1 2 +se22 +2*se1 *se2

Once the t value was computed, it was compared with the published tables of values
at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. For this report, an alpha value of .05 was
used, which has a t value of 1.96. If the t value was larger than 1.96, then the difference between the two estimates is statistically signiﬁcant at the 95 percent level.
A linear trend test was used when differences among percentages were examined relative to ordered categories of a variable, rather than the differences between two discrete categories. This test allows one to examine whether, for example, the percentage
of students using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage
of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased (or decreased)
with their age. Based on a regression with, for example, student’s age as the independent variable and whether a student was physically attacked as the dependent variable, the test involves computing the regression coefﬁcient (b) and its corresponding
standard error (se). The ratio of these two (b/se) is the test statistic t. If t is greater than
1.96, the critical value for one comparison at the .05 alpha level, the hypothesis that
there is a linear relationship between student’s age and being physically attacked is not
rejected.
Some comparisons among categories of an ordered variable with three or more levels involved a test for a linear trend across all categories, rather than a series of tests
between pairs of categories. In this report, when differences among percentages were
examined relative to a variable with ordered categories, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. To do this, ANOVA
models included orthogonal linear contrasts corresponding to successive levels of the
independent variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors (that is, standard errors that were calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance between the means,
and the unweighted sample sizes were used to partition the total sum of squares into
within- and between-group sums of squares. These were used to create mean squares
for the within- and between-group variance components and their corresponding F statistics, which were then compared with published values of F for a signiﬁcance level of
.05. Signiﬁcant values of both the overall F and the F associated with the linear contrast
term were required as evidence of a linear relationship between the two variables.

Standard errors of crime level data and aggregated crime rates
per 1,000 persons were calculated using three generalized
variance function (gvf) constant parameters (denoted as a, b,
and c ) and formulas published in the Methodology Section
of Criminal Victimization in the United States—Statistical
Tables (NCJ184938) on the Bureau of Justice Statistics website:
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cvusst.htm .
The formula used to calculate standard errors ( q ) of crime level data
(x ) is:
ax 2 + bx + cx 3/2

where x is the estimated number of crimes of interest, and a, b, and
c are gvf constant parameters.
The formula used to calculate standard errors of aggregated crime
rates per 1,000 persons ( r ) is:
br (1000 - r) /y + cr ( 1000r - r) /

(y)

where r is the aggregate crime rate (i.e., 1000*total crimes/
total population), y is the aggregated base population, and b
and c are gvf constant parameters. The three gvf constant
parameters associated with the specific years are:

GLOSSARY OF TERMS

GENERAL TERMS
Cluster sampling Cluster sampling is a technique in which the sampling of respondents or
subjects occurs within clusters or groups. For example, selecting students by sampling
schools and the students that attend that school.
Crime Any violation of a statute or regulation or any act that the government has determined is injurious to the public, including felonies and misdemeanors. Such violation
may or may not involve violence, and it may affect individuals or property.
Incident A speciﬁc criminal act or offense involving one or more victims and one or more
offenders.
Multistage sampling A survey sampling technique in which there is more than one wave
of sampling. That is, one sample of units is drawn, and then another sample is drawn
within that sample. For example, at the ﬁrst stage, a number of Census blocks may be
sampled out of all the Census blocks in the United States. At the second stage, households are sampled within the previously sampled Census blocks.
Prevalence The percentage of the population directly affected by crime in a given period.
This rate is based upon speciﬁc information elicited directly from the respondent regarding crimes committed against his or her person, against his or her property, or
against an individual bearing a unique relationship to him or her. It is not based upon
perceptions and beliefs about, or reactions to, criminal acts.
School An education institution consisting of one or more of grades K through 12.
School crime Any criminal activity that is committed on school property.
School year The 12-month period of time denoting the beginning and ending dates for
school accounting purposes, usually from July 1 through June 30.
Stratiﬁcation A survey sampling technique in which the target population is divided into
mutually exclusive groups or strata based on some variable or variables (e.g., metropolitan area) and sampling of units occurs separately within each stratum.
Unequal probabilities A survey sampling technique in which sampled units do not have
the same probability of selection into the sample. For example, the investigator may
oversample minority students in order to increase the sample sizes of minority students.
Minority students would then be more likely than other students to be sampled.

SPECIFIC TERMS USED

IN VARIOUS

SURVEYS

School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study
Homicide An act involving a killing of one person by another resulting from interpersonal
violence.

School-associated violent death A homicide or suicide in which the fatal injury occurred on
the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States, while
the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at such a school, or while the
victim was attending or traveling to or from an ofﬁcial school-sponsored event. Victims
included nonstudents as well as students and staff members.
Suicide An act of taking one’s own life voluntarily and intentionally.

National Crime Victimization Survey
Aggravated assault Attack or attempted attack with a weapon, regardless of whether or not
an injury occurs, and attack without a weapon when serious injury results.
At school (students) Inside the school building, on school property (school parking area,
play area, school bus, etc.), or on the way to or from school.
Rape Forced sexual intercourse including both psychological coercion as well as physical force. Forced sexual intercourse means vaginal, anal, or oral penetration by the
offender(s). Includes attempts and verbal threats of rape. This category also includes
incidents where the penetration is from a foreign object, such as a bottle.
Robbery Completed or attempted theft, directly from a person, of property or cash by force
or threat of force, with or without a weapon, and with or without injury.
Rural A place not located inside the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). This category includes a variety of localities, ranging from sparsely populated rural areas to cities with
populations of less than 50,000.
Serious violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated assault.
Sexual assault A wide range of victimizations, separate from rape or attempted rape. These
crimes include attacks or attempted attacks generally involving unwanted sexual contact between the victim and offender. Sexual assault may or may not involve force and
includes such things as grabbing or fondling. Sexual assault also includes verbal threats.
Simple assault Attack without a weapon resulting either in no injury, minor injury, or an undetermined injury requiring less than 2 days of hospitalization. Also includes attempted
assault without a weapon.
Suburban A county or counties containing a central city, plus any contiguous counties that
are linked socially and economically to the central city. On the data tables, suburban
areas are categorized as those portions of metropolitan areas situated “outside central
cities.”
Theft Completed or attempted theft of property or cash without personal contact.
Urban The largest city (or grouping of cities) in an MSA.
Victimization A crime as it affects one individual person or household. For personal crimes,
the number of victimizations is equal to the number of victims involved. The number
of victimizations may be greater than the number of incidents because more than one
person may be victimized during an incident.
