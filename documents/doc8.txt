verbal bullying, fighting, drug useweapons use, making threats***We all want to prevent violence in our schools. And thankfully, in the year since theSandy Hook Shooting, the second worst school shooting in the history of the United States, more school districts shied away from Columbine-era solutions. Schools districts across the country are recognizing that they cannot arrest their way to safer schools. Not only that, but schools are beginning to recognize that reforming overly-punitive and police centric school discipline policies will help improve academic achievement and reform the racial disparities that still exist in our public schools.In response to allegations that African-American schoolchildren were unfairly targeted for harsh punishment, the Memphis Police and the Memphis City Schools entered into anagreementthat ensures children are not arrested for minor offenses that occur on school grounds, but are instead subject to sanctions that will not interrupt their education, like community services or restitution. During the first year of this agreement, 1,000 fewer children have been imprisoned in Memphis and the city'scrime rates have significantly decreased.Broward County Floridarecently adopted a similar model in an effort to reduce the number of children arrested at school, improve its dropout rate and eliminate the achievement gap that leaves many black male children behind.[See a collection of editorial cartoons on the Newtown shooting.]For years, families in Meridian Mississippi decried the discipline system in the public schools there for discriminating against African-American children by pushing them out of school for behavior that was overlooked when committed by white students. Finally, this year, the U.S. Department of Justice found that Meridian Public Schools, subjected black students to "harsher consequences, including longer suspensions, than white students for comparable misbehavior, even where the students were at the same school, were of similar ages, and had similar disciplinary histories."The school district agreed to a remedy that remedy practically eliminates the role of law enforcement in school discipline.Despite the positive trend of reducing the traditional "lock 'em up" police presence in schools, the federal government recently made $45 million availablefor new school resource officer positions around the country. If past is prologue, this influx of officers policing our public schoolchildren will result in another wave of abuse and countless children put out of school and arrested for minor misbehavior. This is not the fault of the officers. They are placed into our schools with the tools to police  not to resolve conflict or to interact with children.***disrupts classroom activitiesdoes poorly in schoolfrequently gets into fights with other children at school (uncontrollable anger,impulsive and chronic hitting, intimidating and bullying behavior)reacts to disappointments, criticism, or teasing with extreme and intense anger,blame, or revengewatches many violent television shows and movies or plays a lot of violent gameshas few friends and is often rejected by other children because of his or her behaviormakes friends with other children known to be unruly or aggressive
