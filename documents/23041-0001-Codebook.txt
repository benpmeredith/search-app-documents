In order to study the relationship between victimization at school Series Information: and the school environment, and to monitor changes in student experiences with victimization, accurate information regarding its incidence must be collected. The Census Bureau conducts an ongoing survey called the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) for the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). This survey is a major source of statistical information about the nature and extent of crime throughout the United States. Periodically, along with the regular NCVS information, additional information is obtained about specific issues related to crime using a supplemental survey instrument. The school crime supplement is one such survey. Version Statement Version Responsibility: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research Study Scope Subject Information crime, crime in schools, crime rates, crime reporting, crime statistics, drugs, educational environment, fear of crime, juvenile crime, offenses, property crimes, reactions to crime, robbery, school attendance, school security, school violence, student attitudes, student behavior, vandalism, victimization, victims Keyword(s): Topic Classification(s): Social Institutions and Behavior, Crime and the Criminal Justice System Abstract The primary purpose of the School Crime Supplement is to obtain additional information about school-related victimizations so that policymakers, academic researchers, practitioners at the Federal, - 4 - - Study 23041 -state and local levels, and special interest groups who are concerned with crime in schools can make informed decisions concerning policies and programs. The SCS asks questions related to students' experiences with, and perceptions of crime and safety at school, including preventive measures employed by schools, students' participation in after school activities, students' perception of school rules and enforcement of these rules, the presence of weapons, drugs, alcohol, and gangs in school, student bullying, hate-related incidents, and attitudinal questions relating to the fear of victimization at school. These responses are linked to the NCVS survey instrument responses for a more complete understanding of the individual student's circumstances. The 2007 School Crime Supplement (SCS) was the seventh implementation of an occasional supplement to the annual NCVS to obtain specific information about school-related victimization and disorder on a national level. The SCS was fielded first in 1989, and then again in 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2007. The initial fielding in 1989 was conducted by the BJS in conjunction with the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). The 1995 supplement was jointly sponsored by the BJS and the National Center for Education Statistics. The 1999 SCS was sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which plans to conduct the SCS as a supplement to the NCVS every two years. Since the SCS is a supplement to the NCVS, it is conducted under the authority of title 42, United States Code, sections 3732. Only Census employees sworn to preserve confidentiality may see the completed questionnaires. Summary Data Description Date(s) of Collection: January, 2007 - June, 2007 Country: United States Geographic Coverage: United States Geographic Unit: Region Unit of Analysis: Individual NCVS interviews are conducted with each household member age 12 years old or older. In 2007 only household members ages 12 to 18 were given an SCS interview, following a completed NCVS Universe: interview. Persons ages 12 to 18 who were in primary or secondary education programs leading to a high school diploma (elementary through high school), and who had been enrolled sometime during the six months prior to the interview, were administered the 2007 SCS questionnaire. Persons who had dropped out of school; been expelled or suspended from school; or who were temporarily absent from school for any other reason, such as illness or vacation, were eligible as long as they were attending school at any time during the six months prior to the month of the interview. Students who were home schooled were not included past the screening questions since it was determined that many of the questions in the SCS were not relevant to their situation. In 1989 and 1995, NCVS sample household members age 12-19 were considered eligible to receive the SCS. However, it was determined that most 19 year olds did not meet the eligibility criteria of being currently enrolled in a post-secondary school so the upper range was lowered to 18 years old for the 1999 SCS. School, for SCS purposes, was defined as any institution designed to advance a person toward a high school diploma. This included graded public or private elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, home schools, Church schools, and vocational or trade schools that led to a high school diploma. Not included were persons attending colleges or universities, except in cases where a high school student was taking an upper level course before the high school diploma was obtained; persons seeking their GED; persons attending night school; and persons attending vocational trade, business, correspondence, or other specialized schools that are not associated with academics such as beauty schools and mechanic schools. - 5 - - Study 23041 -Kind of Data: Survey data Methodology and Processing Data Collection Methodology Time Method: Cross-section Data Collector: United States Department of Commerce. Bureau of the Census The SCS was administered at the end of the NCVS interview for each eligible respondent. The 2007 SCS was conducted from January through June 2007. Sampling Procedure: Each month the U.S. Census Bureau selects respondents for the NCVS using a "rotating panel" design. Households are randomly selected and all age-eligible individuals become part of the panel. The sample of households is divided into groups or rotations. Once in the sample, respondents are interviewed every six months for a total of seven interviews over a three-year period. The first interview is considered the incoming rotation. The second through the seventh interview are in the continuing rotations. The first interview is face-to-face; the rest are by telephone unless the circumstances call for an in-person interview. After the seventh interview the household leaves the panel and a new household is rotated into the sample. The rotation scheme is used to reduce respondent burden that may result if they were to remain permanently in the sample. The SCS was administered at all NCVS households interviewed from January through June 2007. For both the NCVS and the SCS, data collection was done using computer-assisted telephone interviewing and computer-assisted personal interviewing. Mode of Data Collection: Each SCS interview took an average of about 10 minutes to complete. Type of Research Instrument: Structured Because the National Crime Victimization Survey and School Crime Supplement Survey sample represent the U.S. population 12 years and older, population estimates can be generated from the Weighting: sample cases. That is, the data collected can be used to make inferences about the 12- to 18-year-old student population in 2007. Before such inferences can be made, it is important to adjust the sample to assure that the sample is similar to the entire population of such students. Each person interviewed in the survey represents a probable percentage of all cases if the total population were to be interviewed. Multiplying each case by a factor (i.e., weight) adjusts the unweighted counts to the population size. The final weight adjusts for unequal probabilities of selection. The SCS public use file provides two weights which are used depending whether NCVS or SCS estimates are being generated. The weights created for the SCS are a combination of household-level and person-level adjustment factors. In the NCVS, adjustments were made to account for both household and person non-interviews. Additional factors were then applied to reduce the variance of the estimate by correcting for the differences between sample distribution of age, race, and sex, and known population distributions of these characteristics. This also reduced the bias due to undercoverage of various portions of the population. The resulting weights were assigned to all interviewed households and persons on the file. Modifications to the regular NCVS weighting program were necessary for the weighting of the SCS file. Modified weighting procedures were necessary because of the following differences between SCS and NCVS: е The eligible population for SCS differs from the eligible population for NCVS. е A person can respond to the NCVS and not the SCS. - 6 - - Study 23041 -A special weighting adjustment was performed on the SCS data. Noninterview adjustment factors were computed to adjust the weighting for SCS noninterviews. Two SCS person weights were computed as a result of applying special adjustment factors to the NCVS final person weight. е The first SCS weight computed was derived using the final NCVS person weight that was calculated for all interviewed persons in interviewed continuing households and applying a within-SCS noninterview adjustment factor. This weight, which should be used if producing NCVS estimates using only the continuing rotations, is located in the NCVS section of the NCVS/SCS person record. е The second SCS weight was derived using the final NCVS person weight that was calculated for all interviewed persons in interviewed continuing and incoming households with a within-SCS noninterview adjustment factor applied. This weight, which should be used if producing SCS estimates using all rotations, is located in the SCS section of the NCVS/SCS person record. е A third weight, the incident weight, is most frequently used to compute estimates of the characteristics of crime incidents (e.g., time of occurrence). Comparisons of student victimization rates among the seven supplements should be made with caution. For the 1989 and the 1995 SCS, 19-year old household members also were considered eligible for the SCS interview. This upper age range was lowered to 18 for eligibility in the 1999 SCS because it was determined that most 19-year-olds did not meet the other eligibility requirement of being currently enrolled in a secondary school. In addition, due to the redesign of the NCVS in 1992, NCVS item-based cross-year changes in reported victimization rates, or lack thereof, may only be the result of changes in how the questions were asked and not of actual changes in the incidence of victimization. Because NCVS questionnaires were completed before students were given the SCS, it is likely that these changes to the NCVS victimization screening procedures differentially affected responses to the 1989 and 1995 SCS victimization items. Other items, such as fear at school, avoidance of places at school, and reports of gangs at school, followed the victimization items on the SCS survey. Notes SURVEY METHODOLOGY Due to changes in survey methodology in 2006 that mainly affected rural areas, estimates for 2006 and subsequent years for rural areas are not comparable to previous years. As a result, this variable may not accurately reflect the extent of victimization in urban, suburban and rural areas. Therefore, care should be taken in interpreting the results of this variable. See Criminal Victimization, 2006 Technical Notes for an explanation of the changes to the survey and their impacts on estimates of crime. Notes QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPMENT The Bureau of Justice Statistics, the National Center for Education Statistics, and the Census Bureau jointly designed the survey questionnaire. Since many of the questions used in the 1995 survey were incorporated in the 1999 instrument, only minimal testing of the questionnaire was conducted for 1999 and subsequent years. All of the SCS instruments differ in some respects. Due to the significant changes that occurred to the NCVS data collection procedure and instrument during the 1992 redesign, caution should be used when comparing results from the 1989 SCS to later years for the SCS. The final questionnaire consisted of eight sections. They included: - 7 - - Study 23041 -е Screen Questions - The first section contained the screen questions which were asked to determine if the respondent was eligible for the SCS. е Environmental Questions - This section obtained selected information on the type of school the student attended, including whether the school was private or public, the grade levels taught, measures taken by the school to ensure student safety, and the availability of drugs and alcohol in school. е Fighting, Bullying, and Hate Behaviors - The third section contained questions related to students' experiences with physical fights, bullying, and hate-related words and hate-related grafitti at school. е Avoidance - The fourth section contained avoidance questions which identified the effect of fear of crime on behavior. The avoidance questions were designed to determine if students stayed away from school or particular places at school, or avoided participating in extra-curricular activities at their school for fear of being attacked or harmed. е Fear - The fifth section asked questions pertaining to how often student feared an attack or being harmed. е Weapons - The sixth section asked questions pertaining to weapons. The purpose of these questions was to determine if students brought weapons to school for protection. е Gangs - The seventh section contained questions relating to the presence of organized gangs at school and whether students came into contact with gangs or gang members at school. е Student Characteristics - The eighth section contained questions on the respondent's attendance, grades, and plans regarding college. Notes GENERAL INTERVIEWING SEQUENCE The general interview sequence for the SCS was to ask all appropriate NCVS questions of one household member and if eligible for the SCS, ask all appropriate SCS questions before proceeding on to the next household member. This is done to avoid any increase in NCVS nonresponse due to the supplemental questions. The NCVS-1, the screen questionnaire, describes criminal incidents using everyday language in order to ascertain whether the respondent has been victimized during the six months prior to interview. The screening section relies on a series of cues and questions to describe various behaviors and characteristics of a criminal event. Any positive responses are followed by the incident report (NCVS-2), detailing the specific characteristics of each incident. Once the NCVS data collection process is complete, each eligible respondent is administered the SCS. For more detail on the NCVS consult the codebook for the National Crime Victimization Survey, 2006 [Record-Type Files] [ICPSR 22560]. Notes PROXY INTERVIEWS The same proxy respondent rules apply to the SCS that apply to the NCVS. Proxy interviews are interviews conducted in which one household member answers the questions for another in the household. For the SCS, household members ages 12 to 18 were interviewed directly except in limited situations in which proxy interviews were accepted. If the interview was a proxy for the NCVS, a proxy interview was acceptable for the SCS. Proxy interviews were allowed only under the following circumstances: е If a child was 12 or 13 years old, a self-response interview was attempted. If parents refused to let the interviewer speak to the 12 or 13 year old, a proxy interview could be conducted with the parent. е If a household member between ages 12 to 18 years old was temporarily absent and not expected to return to the sample household at all during the interview period, a proxy interview was acceptable. - 8 - - Study 23041 -е A proxy interview was accepted if a household member was considered physically or mentally unable to answer the questions. Specifically, the person must have been unable to be interviewed due to health problems or mental incompetence. Further, this condition must have been continuous during the entire interview period and did not include colds or flu, temporary incapacitation, or problems that might have been aggravated because the respondent found the questions upsetting. е If an interview could not be obtained, and one of the above situations did not exist, a proxy interview was not allowable and the respondent was considered a noninterview. Proxy interviews accounted for 195 of the 6,503 interviews in 2007. Noninterviews A person was considered a noninterview for the SCS if: е the person was an NCVS noninterview, е the person was an NCVS interview but refused or was unavailable for the SCS interview, е the person was physically or mentally unable to answer the questions and no proxy was available, or е an acceptable proxy respondent refused to give a proxy SCS interview. Interviewers were instructed to complete selected items on the SCS questionnaire to identify each type of noninterview. Of the 11,161 eligible respondents, there were 4,658 noninterview persons, or 41.7 percent of the eligible SCS sample. Responses to both the NCVS and SCS are confidential by law by the BJS under title 42, United States Code, sections 3735 and 3789g, and by the Census Bureau under title 13, United States Code, section 9. Interviewers are instructed to conduct interviews in privacy unless respondents specifically agree to permit others to be present. Most interviews for the NCVS and SCS were conducted by telephone, and most questions required "yes" or "no" answers, thereby affording respondents a further measure of privacy. By law, identifiable information about respondents may not be disclosed or released to others for any purpose. Data Appraisal Information Of the 11,161 NCVS respondents eligible for the SCS supplement, 6,503 (58.3%) completed the SCS interview. The remaining 41.7% were noninterviews. Response Rate: Unit response rates indicate how many sampled units completed interviews. Because interviews with students could only be completed in households that responded to the NCVS, the unit completion rate for the SCS reflects both the NCVS household interview completion rate and the student interview completion rate. See Appendix I - Response Rates. (The response rate for households with students between the ages of 12 and 19 (for the 1989 and 1995 SCS) and between the ages of 12 and 18 (for the 1999 SCS) was not calculated, but is assumed to be the same as that of all households. The reported unit response rates are unweighted.) In 1992, the National Crime Survey (NCS) was redesigned and renamed the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). Because of the redesign, victimization estimates from the 1995 and later SCS cannot be readily compared to the 1989 estimates. One of the many changes made during the redesign was the implementation of a different screening procedure meant to elicit a more complete tally of victimization incidents than did the one used in the 1989 NCS. For instance, the screener used in 1995 and later specifically asked whether respondents had been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted, whereas the 1989 screener did not. Therefore, cross-year changes between preand post-redesign stages in reported victimization rates, or lack thereof, may only be the result of changes in how the questions were asked (For more details about this issue, see Kinderman, Lynch, Cantor (1997)). - 9 - - Study 23041 -For most types of crime, the redesigned methods elicit more reports of victimizations. However, the effect is not uniform across all types of crime and sub-populations. For example, some crime categories, such as assault, are affected more by the NCVS redesign than others, such as robbery. Other effects of the NCVS redesign include improved estimates of certain hard to enumerate crimes such as domestic violence, rape and sexual attack (Rand, Lynch and Cantor, 1997). Because NCVS questionnaires are completed before students are given the SCS questionnaire, it is likely that changes to NCVS victimization screening procedures completed in 1992 differentially affected responses in 1995 and subsequent SCS victimization items. While the assumption is not possible to test, it is nonetheless reasonable to expect that by providing a more detailed victimization screening instrument in the 1995 and later NCVS, respondents in these years had improved victimization recall than did 1989 SCS respondents. The sample of students selected for each SCS is just one of many possible samples that could have been selected. It is possible that estimates from a given SCS student sample may differ from estimates Estimates of Sampling Error: that would have been produced from other student samples. This type of variability is called sampling error, or the standard error, because it arises from using a sample of students rather than all students. The standard error is a measure of the variability of a parameter estimate. It indicates how much variation there is in the population of possible estimates of a parameter for a given sample size. The probability that a complete census count would differ from the sample estimate by less than 1 standard error is about 68 percent. The chance that the difference would be less than 1.65 standard errors is about 90 percent, and that the difference would be less than 1.96 standard errors, about 95 percent. Standard errors are typically developed assuming that the sample is drawn purely at random. The sample for the SCS was not a simple random sample, however. The NCVS and SCS rely on a stratified, multi-stage cluster sample design. Standard errors should be calculated by taking this "design effect" into consideration. Failure to take it into account will compromise statistical tests. Calculating standard errors by assuming a simple random sample (which is the default in most statistical software packages) when in fact a cluster sample was used results in standard errors that are smaller than when taking cluster sampling into consideration. Further, estimates are generally computed on weighted rather than raw data, which are sums of the weights of the cases selected. Computing standard errors on these sums as if they were independent observations would produce artificially small results and thus compromise the statistical tests involved. Calculation of the standard errors requires procedures that are markedly different from the ones used when the data are from a simple random sample. One can use direct variance calculation methods designed for complex survey designs, or compute statistics and standard errors by using generalized variance function (gvf) constant parameters. For additional discussion of the gvf and calculating standard errors, see Appendix II - Standard Errors. Data Access Dataset Availability Location: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research Data Use Statement: Publications based on ICPSR data collections should acknowledge those sources by means of bibliographic citations.

That is, if a household contained one non SCS-eligible person and one SCS-eligible person, only the SCS-eligible person information was included as a record on the file. NCVS data are organized in a hierarchical format. There are four unique record types: е Record Type 001, the address record, contains limited information about the household. е Record Type 002, contains the entire NCVS household record. е Record Type 003, contains the entire NCVS person record which was expanded to include the 2003 SCS information. е Record Type 004, contains the entire incident record. For the SCS, these records were restructured into a single record for each SCS person, containing an expanded incident record to include information on all incidents reported by that respondent in the same record. A maximum number of nine incidents was needed to capture all the incidents reported by a single respondent. That is, no SCS person reported more than nine incidents in 2007. The SCS data file is rectangular where each case on the public use file represents an SCS individual with between zero and nine incidents. Prior to its release, the file was reviewed by the Census Bureau's Disclosure Review Board (DRB) to ensure that the contents of the file did not violate any disclosure avoidance measures. In addition, data that may have provided geographic information by inference were blanked because of data confidentiality reasons. Although the school attended was uniquely coded, the DRB mandated that this code be suppressed in the public use file to avoid disclosure of information about any one individual. File Dimensions: е No. of Cases: 11,161 е No. of Variables: 5,413 е Record Length: 7,097 е Records per Case: 1 е Overall No. of Records: 11,161 Type of File: ASCII data file Data Format: Logical record length Place of File Production: Ann Arbor, MI: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research - 13 - - Study 23041 -The data collection was processed according to the standard ICPSR processing procedures.

Variables for a maximum of nine incidents have been appended to the person records. The incident variables are named with a prefix of V4 and a sufix of _1 to _9. The codebook describes only the first iteration of the incident variables. Descriptions for iterations two through nine are excluded because they are identical to iteration one. Notes The records in the School Crime Supplement (SCS) 2007 represent persons interviewed in the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) during the first six months of 2007 who are 12-18 years old. In principle one can compare the count of SCS 2007 records with a subset of records from the NCVS 2007 and obtain the same age distribution. However, upon doing so one will find that the SCS 2007 has 161 more records. The SCS 2007 has 11,161 records; each of these represents a person 12-18 years old. The NCVS for the first six months of 2007 has 11,000 person records with ages 12-18 years. The difference of 161 records is due to separate and distinct age allocation routines being used to create the SCS 2007 file and the NCVS 2007 file. The allocation routine used for the SCS 2007 allocated more records to the age range of 12-18 than the NCVS 2007 routine did. Notes While it is not necessary to match the SCS 2007 file to the NCVS 2007 files - virtually all the variables from the NCVS are included with the SCS - it can be done. To match the SCS 2007 file to the NCVS 2007 person record-type file, create an NCVS ID FOR PERSONS (IDPER) by concatenating: е SAMPLE NUMBER е SCRAMBLED CONTROL NUMBER е HOUSEHOLD NUMBER е PANEL AND ROTATION GROUP е PERSON LINE NUMBER The resulting variable is the "key" for matching to the NCVS 2007 person record-type file. Notes VARIABLE CHANGES, NEW VARIABLES AND DELETED VARIABLES CHANGES TO VARIABLES -------------------- Several variables in the 2007 SCS data differ from the 2005 SCS. Most of the changes involve the time period that a respondent is asked to - 14 - - Study 23041 -refer to. In the 2005 data the time period is generally the last six months. In the 2007 data the time period that is referred to is this school year. SCS variables with changes from 2005 to 2007 are summarized below using this pattern: Item number - corresponds to the 2007 instrument 2005 Variable_Name Variable_Label Question_Text 2007 Variable_Name Variable_Label Question_Text ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Item 1a 2005 VS010 ATTEND SCHOOL LAST 6 MONTHS Did you attend school at any time during the last 6 months, that is, any time since _____ 1st, 2004? 2007 VS010 ATTEND SCHOOL THIS SCHOOL YEAR Did you attend school at any time this school year? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Item 2a 2005 VS013 HOME-SCHOOL GRADE EQUIVALENT During the time you were home-schooled in the last 6 months, what grade would you have been in if you were in a public or private school? 2007 VS013 No change to variable label During the time you were home-schooled this school year, what grade would you have been in if you were in a public or private school? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Item 2b 2005 VS014 SCHOOL GRADE LAST 6 MONTHS During the last 6 months, that is, any time since _____ 1st 2004, what grade were you in school? 2007 VS014 WHAT GRADE CURRENTLY What grade are you in? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Item 7b - 15 - - Study 23041 -2005 VS019 ASSIGNED SCHOOL OR FAMILY CHOOSE Is this your regularly assigned school or a school that you or your family chose? 2007 VS019 No change to variable label Is this the regular school that most of the students in your neighborhood attend? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Item 12b 2005 VS027 MOST STUDENTS ALLOWED TO LEAVE AT LUNCH Are MOST students at your school allowed to leave the school grounds to eat lunch? 2007 VS027 STUDENTS ALLOWED TO LEAVE AT LUNCH Are students in your grade level allowed to leave school grounds to eat lunch? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Item 13f 2005 VS033 EXTRA-CURR: SERVICE CLUBS During the last 6 months, have you participated in any of the following extra-curricular activities sponsored by your school such as: f.

This adjustment was a one-time event implemented to counteract the effects of including the bounding interview on the NCVS PUF. Traditionally, the bounding interview is excluded from the PUF. Past research has shown that unbounded interviews produce higher victimization rates than bounded interviews. Therefore a decision was made to adjust downward the estimated number of crimes reported in the new areas to reduce the bias caused by using unbounded interviews. There is also evidence that victimization rates may vary by the number of times the household has been interviewed. To reflect this, the adjustment was performed by time in sample (TIS). - 420 - - Study 23041 -The adjustments made to the final weights were based on collection-year 2003 data due to the unavailability of the collection-year 2005 data and anomalies encountered in the 2004 data. One set of adjustment factors was calculated for personal crimes by TIS and another for property crimes by TIS. These adjustment factors were applied to the final weight of persons and households. The victimization weight contains these adjusted weights. For any other time period, the victimization weight will be the same as the person weight or household weight for personal and property crimes, respectively. Value Label -1 (M) Invalid until 2005 Q1 Notes: This variable was added in quarter 1, 2005. - 421 - - Study 23041 -Appendix I ╨ Response Rates 1989 1995 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 Household Completion Rate 96.5 95.1 93.8 93.1 91.9 90.6 90.4 Student Completion Rate 86.5 77.5 77.6 77.0 69.6 61.7* 58.3 Overall SCS Response Rate 83.5 73.7 72.8 71.7 64.0 56.0 52.7 * In 2005, the person level nonresponse rate for the 12-18 population was 29.6 percent compared to 24.2 percent in 2003 on the NCVS. This negatively affected the student completion rate because SCS eligible respondents that do not complete their NCVS interview are not eligible for the SCS. Appendix II ╨ Standard Errors The gvf represents the curve fitted to the individual standard errors calculated using the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique. The three constant parameters (a, b, and c) derived from the curve fitting process are provided below for those who prefer to use this alternative method of calculating standard errors: Year a b c 1989 0.00001559 3,108 0.000 1995 -0.00006269 2,278 1.804 1999 -0.00026646 2,579 2.826 2001 0.00011330 2,803 2.905 2003 -0.00029301 3,059 2.872 2005 -0.00032187 4,074 3.137 2007 -0.00035872 3,084 3.685 To calculate the standard errors associated with percentages, the following formula is used: standard error of p = where p is the percentage of interest expressed as a proportion and y is the size of the population to which the percentage applies. Once the standard error of the proportion is estimated, it needs to be multiplied by 100 to make it applicable to the percentage. To calculate the adjusted standard errors associated with population counts, the following applies: standard error of x = where x is the estimated number of students who experienced a given event (e.g., violent victimization). The U.S. Bureau of the Census has developed a set of programs to calculate NCVS generalized variance formulae, known as SIGMA programs. To facilitate use of these formulae, spreadsheet versions of these SIGMA programs are available on the BJS web site (www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/), which will allow users to enter gvf constants and values in appropriate cells. Spreadsheet macros will them calculate the appropriate variances and standard errors and perform tests for any differences requested. DTICE -We are conducf8ng fh8s survey under the aufhmty of T8de 13.
