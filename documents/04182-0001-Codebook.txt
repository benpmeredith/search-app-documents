In order to study the relationshipbetween victimization at school and the school environment, and to monitor changes instudent experiences with victimization, accurate information regarding its incidencemust be collected.The Census Bureau conducts an ongoing survey called the National Crime VictimizationSurvey (NCVS) for the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). This survey is a major sourceof statistical information about the nature and extent of crime throughout the UnitedStates. Periodically, along with the regular NCVS information, additional information isobtained about specific issues related to crime using a supplemental survey instrument.The 2003 School Crime Supplement (SCS) was the fifth implementation of an occasionalsupplement to the annual NCVS to obtain specific information about school relatedvictimization and disorder on a national level. The SCS was fielded first in 1989, andthen again in 1995, 1999, and 2001. The initial fielding in 1989 was conducted by theBJS in conjunction with the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). The 1995 supplement wasjointly sponsored by the BJS and the NCES. The 1999 SCS was sponsored by theNational Center for Education Statistics, which plans to conduct the SCS as a supplementto the NCVS every two years. The 2005 supplement began in January and will continue1for six months through June 2005. Since the SCS is a supplement to the NCVS, it isconducted under the authority of title 42, United States Code, sections 3732. Only Censusemployees sworn to preserve confidentiality may see the completed questionnaires.The primary purpose of the School Crime Supplement is to obtain additional informationabout school-related victimizations so that policymakers, academic researchers,practitioners at the Federal, state and local levels, and special interest groups who areconcerned with crime in schools can make informed decisions concerning policies andprograms. The SCS asks questions related to students� experiences with, and perceptionsof crime and safety at school, including preventive measures employed by schools,students� participation in after school activities, students� perception of school rules andenforcement of these rules, the presence of weapons, drugs, alcohol, and gangs in school,student bullying, hate-related incidents, and attitudinal questions relating to the fear ofvictimization at school. These responses are linked to the NCVS survey instrumentresponses for a more complete understanding of the individual student�s circumstances.Eligibility for the 2003 SCS included persons ages 12 to 18 in all NCVS households(including first time in sample households) who had attended school at any time duringthe 6 months preceding the interview and were enrolled in a school which wouldadvance them towards the eventual receipt of a high school diploma. Persons who haddropped out of school, who had been expelled or suspended from school or who weretemporarily absent from school for any other reason, such as an illness or vacation,2were eligible for the survey as long as they were attending school at any time duringthe six months prior to the month of interview. Persons attending home school werealso eligible, but were only asked questions to determine if they were in a home schoolsituation because the supplement questions were not relevant. The SCS wasadministered at the end of the NCVS interview for each eligible respondent.The 2003 SCS was conducted from January through June 2003. Of the 12,176NCVS respondents eligible for the SCS supplement, 69.6% completed the SCSinterview. The remaining 30.4 % were noninterviews.For both the NCVS and the SCS, two modes of data collection were used: paper-andpencilinterviewing (PAPI) and computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). InPAPI, households are interviewed in person or by telephone and the responses are enteredon a paper instrument. In CATI, the interview is conducted by an interviewer who iscalling from a centralized telephone facility using an automated version of the paperinstrument to administer the supplement questions and record the respondent�s answers.PAPI is used in approximately 70% of the households and CATI the remaining 30%.Approximately 90% of all interviews are conducted by phone with the other 10%conducted by personal visit.Each month the U.S. Census Bureau selects respondents for the NCVS using a �rotatingpanel� design. Households are randomly selected and all age-eligible individuals become3part of the panel. The sample of households is divided into groups or rotations. Once inthe sample, respondents are interviewed every six months for a total of seven interviewsover a three-year period. The first interview is considered the incoming rotation. Thesecond through the seventh interview are in the continuing rotations. The first interviewis face-to-face; the rest are by telephone unless the circumstances call for an in-personinterview. After the seventh interview the household leaves the panel and a newhousehold is rotated into the sample. The rotation scheme is used to reduce respondentburden that may result if they were to remain permanently in the sample. The SCS wasadministered at all NCVS households interviewed from January through June 2003.SURVEY DESIGNSample SizeThe target population for the 2003 SCS was defined to be all persons in the NCVSsample who were ages 12 to18, had attended school at any time during the six monthsprior to the month of the interview, and who were enrolled in a school which wouldadvance them towards the eventual receipt of a high school diploma. In 1989 and 1995,NCVS sample household members age 12-19 were considered eligible to receive theSCS. However, it was determined that most 19 year olds did not meet the eligibilitycriteria of being currently enrolled in a post-secondary school so the upper range waslowered to 18 years old for the 1999 SCS. From January 2003 through June 2003,412,176 NCVS respondents were eligible for the SCS. Of these respondents, 8,479, or69.6%, completed the SCS interview.Questionnaire DevelopmentThe Bureau of Justice Statistics, the National Center for Education Statistics, and theCensus Bureau jointly designed the survey questionnaire. Since many of the questionsused in the 1995 survey were incorporated in the 1999 instrument, only minimal testingof the questionnaire was conducted for 1999 and 2001. Based upon the results of thetesting, some minor modifications, mostly wording changes, were made to the instrumentfor 2003.The final questionnaire consisted of six sections. They included:* Screen Questions - The first section contained the screen questions which wereasked to determine if the respondent was eligible for the SCS.* Environmental Questions - This section obtained selected information on thetype of school the student attended, including whether the school was private orpublic, the grade levels taught, measures taken by the school to ensure studentsafety, and the availability of drugs and alcohol in school.* Fighting, Bullying, and Hate Behaviors - The third section contained thevictimization questions which identified or distinguished the nature and extent ofthe crimes. These questions were designed to elicit crimes that occurred only atschool, that is, in the school building, on school grounds, or on a school bus.5* Avoidance - The fourth section contained avoidance questions which identifiedthe effect of fear of crime on behavior. The avoidance questions were designed todetermine if students stayed away from school or particular places at school, oravoided participating in extra-curricular activities at their school for fear of beingattacked or harmed.* Fear - The fifth section asked questions pertaining to how often studentfeared an attack or being harmed.* Weapons - The sixth section asked questions pertaining to weapons. Thepurpose of these questions was to determine if students brought weapons toschool for protection.* Gangs - The seventh section contained questions relating to the presence oforganized gangs at school and whether students came into contact with gangsor gang members at school.* Student Characteristics � The eighth section contained questions on therespondent�s attendance, grades, and plans regarding college.The 1989, 1995, 1999, 2001, and 2003 instruments differ in some respects. Due to the6significant changes that occurred to the NCVS data collection procedure and instrumentduring the 1992 redesign, caution should be used when comparing results from the 1989SCS to later years for the SCS. Compared to the 2001 supplement, the 2003 instrumentadded new questions and changed wording of some existing questions as follows:* Screen Questions - The 2003 SCS changed the wording on question 2a toaccount for situations where the student is currently in private or public school butprior to this and in the last six months was home-schooled.* School Environment - The 2003 SCS changed the order of questions and addedemphasis (capitalized MOST in 12b) to better capture whether students leaveschool at lunch. The wording for question 14 was altered regarding schoolmeasures to ensure students are safe. An interviewer instruction was added to 17aif respondents answered �Don�t know� to questions regarding availability ofdrugs at school.*Avoidance - The 2003 SCS changed language in this section and added a newsection called fear. Per recommendations from the National Center forEducation Statistics, the term �threaten to attack� was replaced with harm inquestions where this phrase was used.Responses from the completed SCS are linked to the individual�s responses from theNCVS instruments: NCVS-1 and NCVS-2 (if applicable). The NCVS-1 is the basic7screener questionnaire used to record characteristics of all household members 12 yearsof age and older in a sample unit, as well as to screen for incidents of crime which werecommitted against the household and/or household members. When a person reports acrime in the screen questions, a crime incident report, the NCVS-2, is used to gather thedetailed information about each incident. One crime incident report is completed for eachincident to obtain information about the characteristics of the event, including offenderinformation, location, victim behaviors, weapon use and police response. For more detailon the NCVS data collection process consult the National Crime Victimization Codebook,1992-2003 [ICPSR 3995], 2005.Response RatesUnit response rates indicate how many sampled units completed interviews. Becauseinterviews with students could only be completed in households that responded to theNCVS, the unit completion rate for the SCS reflects both the NCVS household interviewcompletion rate and the student interview completion rate. 11985 1995 1999 2001 2003Household Completion Rate 96.5 95.1 93.8 93.1 91.9Student Completion Rate 86.5 77.5 77.6 77.0 69.6Overall SCS Response Rate 83.5 73.7 72.8 71.7 64.01 The response rate for households with students between the ages of 12 and 19 (for the 1989 and 1995SCS) and between the ages of 12 and 18 (for the 1999 SCS) was not calculated, but is assumed to be thesame as that of all households. The reported unit response rates are unweighted.8The rate at which the respondents provide a valid response to a given item is referred toas its item response rate. Item response rates for items on the NCVS and SCS aregenerally high. Most items were answered by over 95 percent of all eligiblerespondents. The only exception was the household income question, which wasanswered by approximately 86 percent of all households in 1999, approximately 90percent of all households in 1995 and 1989, 80 percent of all households in 2001, and78 percent of all households in 2003. Income and income-related questions typicallyhave relatively lower response rates due to their sensitive nature.In 1992, the National Crime Survey (NCS) was redesigned and renamed the NationalCrime Victimization Survey (NCVS). Because of the redesign, victimization estimatesfrom the 1995, 1999, 2001, and 2003 SCS cannot be readily compared to the 1989estimates. One of the many changes made during the redesign was the implementation ofa different screening procedure meant to elicit a more complete tally of victimizationincidents than did the one used in the 1989 NCS. For instance, the 1995, 1999, 2001 and2003 screener specifically asked whether respondents had been raped or otherwisesexually assaulted, whereas the 1989 screener did not. Therefore, cross-year changesbetween pre- and post-redesign stages in reported victimization rates, or lack thereof,may only be the result of changes in how the questions were asked.2 There were no2 For more details about this issue, see Kinderman, Lynch and Cantor (1997).9modifications to the NCVS screener questions between the 1995, 1999, 2001, and 2003SCS.For most types of crime, the redesigned methods elicit more reports of victimizations.However, the effect is not uniform across all types of crime and sub-populations. Forexample, some crime categories, such as assault, are affected more by the NCVS redesignthan others, such as robbery. Other effects of the NCVS redesign include improvedestimates of certain hard to enumerate crimes such as domestic violence, rape and sexualattack (Rand, Lynch and Cantor, 1997).Because NCVS questionnaires are completed before students are given the SCSquestionnaire, it is likely that changes to NCVS victimization screening procedurescompleted in 1992 differentially affected responses in 1995, 1999, 2001, and 2003 SCSvictimization items. While the assumption is not possible to test, it is nonethelessreasonable to expect that by providing a more detailed victimization screening instrumentin the 1995 and 1999 NCVS, respondents in these years had improved victimizationrecall than did 1989 SCS respondents.Length of InterviewEach SCS interview took an average of about 10 minutes to complete.10INTERVIEWING PROCEDURESEligibilityNCVS interviews are conducted with each household member age 12 years old or older.In 2003 only household members ages 12 to 18 were given an SCS interview, following acompleted NCVS interview. Persons ages 12 to 18 who were in primary or secondaryeducation programs leading to a high school diploma (elementary through high school),and who had been enrolled sometime during the 6 months prior to the interview, wereadministered the 2003 SCS questionnaire. Persons who had dropped out of school; beenexpelled or suspended from school; or who were temporarily absent from school for anyother reason, such as illness or vacation, were eligible as long as they were attendingschool at any time during the six months prior to the month of the interview. Studentswho were home schooled were not included past the screening questions since it wasdetermined that many of the questions in the SCS were not relevant to their situation.School, for SCS purposes, was defined as any institution designed to advance a persontowards a high school diploma. This included graded public or private elementaryschools, middle schools, high schools, home schools, Church schools, and vocational ortrade schools that led to a high school diploma. Not included were persons attendingcolleges or universities, except in cases where a high school student was taking an upperlevel course before the high school diploma was obtained; persons seeking their GED;11persons attending night school; and persons attending vocational trade, business,correspondence, or other specialized schools that are not associated with academics suchas beauty schools and mechanic schools.For both the NCVS and the SCS, two modes of data collection were used: paper-andpencilinterviewing (PAPI) and computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). InPAPI, households are interviewed in person or by telephone and the responses are enteredon a paper instrument. In CATI, the interview is conducted by an interviewer callingfrom a centralized telephone facility using an automated version of the paper instrumentto administer the supplement questions and record the respondent�s answers. The CensusBureau has two centralized telephone facilities for the NCVS located in Hagerstown, MDand Tucson, AZ. PAPI is used in approximately 70% of the households and CATI theremaining 30%. For the 2003 SCS, PAPI was used in approximately 80% of thehouseholds and CATI in the remaining 20% (n=2,440). Approximately 69% of allinterviews were conducted by phone (both CATI and non-CATI) with the other 31%conducted by personal visit. Telephone interviews accounted for 5,874 of the 8,479 SCSinterviews in 2003.Proxy InterviewThe same proxy respondent rules apply to the SCS that apply to the NCVS. Proxyinterviews are interviews conducted in which one household member answers thequestions for another in the household. For the SCS, household members ages 12 to 1812were interviewed directly except in limited situations in which proxy interviews wereaccepted. If the interview was a proxy for the NCVS, a proxy interview was acceptablefor the SCS. Proxy interviews were allowed only under the following circumstances:* If a child was 12 or 13 years old, a self-response interview was attempted. Ifparents refused to let the interviewer speak to the 12 or 13 year old, a proxyinterview could be conducted with the parent.* If a household member between ages 12 to 18 years old was temporarily absentand not expected to return to the sample household at all during the interviewperiod, a proxy interview was acceptable.* A proxy interview was accepted if a household member was consideredphysically or mentally unable to answer the questions. Specifically, the personmust have been unable to be interviewed due to health problems or mentalincompetence. Further, this condition must have been continuous during theentire interview period and did not include colds or flu, temporary incapacitation,or problems that might have been aggravated because the respondent found thequestions upsetting.If If an interview could not be obtained, and one of the above situations did notexist, a proxy interview was not allowable and the respondent was considered anoninterview. Proxy interviews accounted for 442 of the 8,479 interviews in 2003.13NoninterviewsA person was considered a noninterview for the SCS if:* the person was an NCVS noninterview,* the person was an NCVS interview but refused or was unavailable for the SCSinterview,* the person was physically or mentally unable to answer the questions and noproxy was available, or* an acceptable proxy respondent refused to give a proxy SCS interview.Interviewers were instructed to compete selected items on the SCS questionnaire toidentify each type of noninterview. Of the 12,176 eligible respondents, there were 3,697noninterview persons, or 30.4 percent of the eligible SCS sample.Responses to both the NCVS and SCS are confidential by law by the BJS under title 42,United States Code, sections 3735 and 3789g, and by the Census Bureau under title 13,United States Code, section 9. Interviewers are instructed to conduct interviews inprivacy unless respondents specifically agree to permit others to be present. Mostinterviews for the NCVS and SCS were conducted by telephone, and most questionsrequired �yes� or �no� answers, thereby affording respondents a further measure ofprivacy. By law, identifiable information about respondents may not be disclosed orreleased to others for any purpose.14General Interviewing SequenceThe general interview sequence for the SCS was to ask all appropriate NCVS questionsof one household member and if eligible for the SCS, ask all appropriate SCS questionsbefore proceeding on to the next household member. This is done to avoid any increasein NCVS nonresponse due to the supplemental questions. The NCVS-1, the screenquestionnaire, describes criminal incidents using everyday language in order to ascertainwhether the respondent has been victimized during the six months prior to interview.The screening section relies on a series of cues and questions to describe variousbehaviors and characteristics of a criminal event.Any positive responses are followed by the incident report (NCVS-2), detailing thespecific characteristics of each incident. Once the NCVS data collection process iscomplete, each eligible respondent is administered the SCS. For more detail on theNCVS consult the National Crime Victimization Codebook, 1992-2003 [ICPSR 3995],2005.TrainingInterviewers received special training for the 2003 SCS in addition to their NCVStraining and experience. For PAPI and CATI interviewers, the Census Bureau developedseparate manuals and self-studies. The manuals provided detailed information about thecontent and administration of the 2003 SCS, covering each item in the questionnaire andaddressing concepts related to the SCS. The CATI and PAPI self-studies provided basicfacts, general procedures, and instructions for conducting the SCS. The training15materials for interviewers differed in one respect between the 1995 and the 1999 SCS.The 1995 SCS included a practice interview in the self-study which took the traineethrough a SCS interview. In 1999 practice exercises were included in the self-studieswhich provided scenarios for interviewers to resolve. This approach was adopted since itwas felt to be a better way to address issues that interviewers might encounter duringSCS interviewing.CLERICAL AND COMPUTER PROCESSINGOnce the data were collected, the SCS went through clerical review and computer editingto ensure high data quality. Clerical processing prepares the data for computerprocessing through a two step operation: clerical editing and the keying of the data tomagnetic tape. Both are also performed on the NCVS data.For PAPI, interviewers edit the SCS questionnaires for completeness and accuracy beforetransmitting them to their respective Census Bureau regional office (RO). In the ROs, theforms are edited for completeness and accuracy and then sent to the National ProcessingCenter (NPC) in Jeffersonville, Indiana for check-in, clerical editing, and keying. Thekeyed files are then sent to Census headquarters for post data collection processing. ForCATI, completed cases are transmitted daily from the Telephone Centers (TCs) toheadquarters for post data-collection processing.16Clerical EditsThe main purpose of the SCS clerical edit was to locate and correct any interviewererrors made during PAPI data collection and, when possible, correct areas of respondentmisunderstanding. Such errors could only be identified by clerical review of the data.Errors were corrected in an effort to improve the accuracy and quality of the data. Alongwith any accompanying NCVS form, SCS forms containing errors that could not beresolved by NPC staff were sent to headquarters staff for resolution during a �referral�process. All resolved SCS referrals and their accompanying NCVS forms were thenreturned to the NPC.Upon completion of the clerical edit, coding, and verification, the questionnaires weretransmitted to the Electronic Data Processing unit in Jeffersonville, Indiana for datakeying. A quality control measure was employed to ensure an acceptable level of qualityof keying. All keying was verified on a 100 percent basis. Upon completion of keyingand verification, the data for each work unit were read to tape and transmitted to CensusBureau Headquarters in Washington, D.C. for computer processing.Computer ProcessingFollowing the clerical processing and keying of the data, computer processing wasinitiated. Computer processing involves merging, matching and editing the NCVS and17SCS files. Only NCVS households with household members ages 12 to 18 were matchedto the SCS file. SCS records which did not match to an NCVS record and were not ableto be matched through a review and editing process were eventually dropped from thefile. For the entire six month period, there were 148 NCVS persons age 12 to 18 who didnot match to an SCS person record. There were also 183 persons who did not match to anNCVS person, so these SCS records were deleted. Overall, there was a 98% SCS initialmatch to the total eligible NCVS persons age 12 to 18.For the 2003 SCS computer editing was performed using a generalized edit systemdesigned to identify (not correct) response errors and compilation errors. Thefollowing computer editing tasks were used for the 2003 SCS data: required data itemtest, range test, skip pattern validation test, list directed edits, survey rules validationand blanking edit.a. Required Data Item Test - The purpose of this test is to validate the dataitems that must be present are in fact present, evidenced by the fact that the dataitem does not contain missing value code (.) as the data value. Required dataitems are items which must be completed by all respondents. If a required dataitem contains a missing value, there is an error.b. Range Test - The purpose of this edit test is to validate that the data valuespresent are within tolerance for the given data item. If the data value is eithertoo large or too small the data item is identified as an error. Range tests are18typically only performed against continuous data items not against discrete dataitems.c. Skip Pattern Validation Tests - The purpose of the Skip Pattern ValidationTests is to determine if the data values of skip items are consistent with the skipinstructions as given on the questionnaire. These edits are often referred to as�consistency tests.� A skip instruction qualifies a respondent to provideinformation on a topic covered within a survey. The skip instruction ascertainsif the respondent exhibited a behavior encompassed by the specific surveysubsection. If the respondent positively indicates that the behavior covered inthe survey subsection is germane then additional questions are asked of therespondent. If the skip instruction determines that the subsection is not germanethen the subsection is skipped.d. List Directed Edits - The purpose of a list directed edit is to validate that thedata value for a specified data item exactly matches one of the data values on aspecified list. The list contains all the valid data values that the specified dataitem can assume and be considered valid. If the specified data item�s data valueis not contained on the list then that data item is invalid.e. Survey Rules Validation - The purpose of these tests are to validate complexinter-item relationships within an observation. These tests determine if the19specified relationships between data items are true. If the statement is false thenthere is an error situation.f. Blanking Edit - After the generalized edit modules are complete, the datawere passed through a blanking edit. This edit checked to make sure that thecase followed the appropriate skip pattern by stepping sequentially through theitems. It deleted entries that should not have been filled. An �out-of-universe�code was assigned to all items that failed the edit.File StructureA six-month NCVS/SCS person-level public use file was created. The NCVS/SCS filecontains data for 1) all households containing SCS-eligible persons (interviewed andnoninterviewed, incoming (unbounded) and continuing rotations), 2) all SCS-eligiblepersons (interviewed and noninterviewed) within these households, and 3) all incidentsreported by the SCS-eligible persons. The file does not contain information for anyhouseholds that did not have SCS-eligible persons in them, nor does it containinformation for any persons within a household other than those who were SCS-eligible.That is, if a household contained one non SCS-eligible person and one SCS-eligibleperson, only the SCS-eligible person information was included as a record on the file.The NCVS data are contained in a hierarchically structured file. There are fourunique record types:20* Record Type 001, the address record, contains limited information about thehousehold.* Record Type 002, contains the entire NCVS household record.* Record Type 003, contains the entire NCVS person record which wasexpanded to include the 2003 SCS information.* Record Type 004, contains the entire incident record.For the SCS, these records were restructured into a single record for each SCS person,containing an expanded incident record to include information on all incidents reportedby that respondent in the same record. A maximum number of nine incidents was neededto capture all the incidents reported by a single respondent. That is, no SCS personreported more than nine incidents in 2003. The SCS data file is rectangular where eachcase on the public use tapes represents an SCS individual with between zero and nineincidents.Prior to its release, the file was reviewed by the Census Bureau�s Disclosure ReviewBoard (DRB) to ensure that the contents of the file did not violate any disclosureavoidance measures. For confidentiality protection of the public use file, recodingprocedures and a control number scrambling routine were performed before the filewas released for public use. For the 2003 NCVS/SCS file a control number scramblingroutine was used that differed from the NCVS control number scrambling routine toprevent matching the two files. In addition, data that may have provided geographicinformation by inference were blanked because of data confidentiality reasons.21Although the school attended was uniquely coded, the DRB mandated that this code besuppressed in the public use file to avoid disclosure of information about any oneindividual.GENERATING ESTIMATESBecause the National Crime Victimization Survey and School Crime Supplement Surveysample represents the U.S. population 12 years and older, population estimates can begenerated from the sample cases. That is, the data collected can be used to makeinferences about the 12- to 18-year-old student population in 2003. Before suchinferences can be made, it is important to adjust the sample to assure that the sample issimilar to the entire population of such students. Each person interviewed in the surveyrepresents a probable percentage of all cases if the total population were to beinterviewed. Multiplying each case by a factor (i.e., weight) adjusts the unweightedcounts to the population size. The final weight adjusts for unequal probabilities ofselection. The SCS public use file provides two weights which are used dependingwhether NCVS or SCS estimates are being generated.WeightingThe weights created for the SCS are a combination of household level and person leveladjustment factors. In the NCVS, adjustments were made to account for both householdand person non-interviews. Additional factors were then applied to reduce the variance of22the estimate by correcting for the differences between sample distribution of age, race,and sex, and known population distributions of these characteristics. This also reducedthe bias due to undercoverage of various portions of the population. The resultingweights were assigned to all interviewed households and persons on the file.Modifications to the regular NCVS weighting program were necessary for theweighting of the SCS file. For the SCS the NCVS data had to be weighted twice: onceincluding continuing rotations only and once including all rotations (both incoming andcontinuing). Incoming rotations are those households interviewed for the first time forthe NCVS. Modified weighting procedures were necessary because of the followingdifferences between SCS and NCVS:* The eligible population for SCS differs from the eligible population for NCVS.* A person can respond to the NCVS and not the SCS.* For select SCS items, the incoming rotation contributes to the estimates as wellas continuing rotations. For the NCVS, only continuing rotations contribute toestimates. Households in the incoming rotations are not included in the NCVSestimates (i.e., have a weight of zero) since the data for these cases are�unbounded.� The purpose of the initial NCVS interview is for purposes ofbounding, that is, to learn about all crimes occurring previously in order to keepthe respondent from reporting them in subsequent interviews.A special weighting adjustment was performed on the SCS data. Noninterviewadjustment factors were computed to adjust the weighting for SCS noninterviews.Two SCS person weights were computed as a result of applying special adjustment23factors to the NCVS final person weight.* The first SCS weight computed was derived using the final NCVS personweight that was calculated for all interviewed persons in interviewed continuinghouseholds and applying a within-SCS noninterview adjustment factor. Thisweight, which should be used if producing NCVS estimates using only thecontinuing rotations, is located in the NCVS section of the NCVS/SCS personrecord.* The second SCS weight was derived using the final NCVS person weight thatwas calculated for all interviewed persons in interviewed continuing andincoming households with a within-SCS noninterview adjustment factor applied.This weight, which should be used if producing SCS estimates using all rotations,is located in the SCS section of the NCVS/SCS person record.A third weight, the incident weight, is not available on the public use file, but can begenerated using the person weight and the number of victims involved (variable sourcecode 683) for each incident. To calculate the incident weight, multiply the personweight by the multiple-victim adjustment factor. The multiple-victim adjustment factoris simply 1 divided by the number of victims present during the incident (SC 680). Thisweight is most frequently used to compute estimates of the characteristics of crimeincidents (e.g., time of occurrence).Comparing student victimization rates between the three supplements (1989, 1995, 1999,2001, and 2003) should be made with caution. For the 1989 and the 1995 SCS, 19-year24old household members also were considered eligible for the SCS interview. This upperage range was lowered to 18 for eligibility in the 1999 SCS because it was determinedthat most 19-year-olds did not meet the other eligibility requirement of being currentlyenrolled in a secondary school. In addition, due to the redesign of the NCVS in 1992,NCVS item-based cross-year changes in reported victimization rates, or lack thereof, mayonly be the result of changes in how the questions were asked and not of actual changesin the incidence of victimization. Because NCVS questionnaires were completed beforestudents were given the SCS, it is likely that these changes to the NCVS victimizationscreening procedures differentially affected responses to the 1989 and 1995 SCSvictimization items. Other items, such as fear at school, avoidance of places at school,and reports of gangs at school, followed the victimization items on the SCS survey.Standard ErrorsThe sample of students selected for each SCS is just one of many possible samples thatcould have been selected. It is possible that estimates from a given SCS student samplemay differ from estimates that would have been produced from other student samples.This type of variability is called sampling error, or the standard error, because it arisesfrom using a sample of students rather than all students.The standard error is a measure of the variability of a parameter estimate. It indicateshow much variation there is in the population of possible estimates of a parameter for agiven sample size. The probability that a complete census count would differ from the25sample estimate by less than 1 standard error is about 68 percent. The chance that thedifference would be less than 1.65 standard errors is about 90 percent, and that thedifference would be less than 1.96 standard errors, about 95 percent.Standard errors are typically developed assuming that the sample is drawn purely atrandom. The sample for the SCS was not a simple random sample, however. The NCVSand SCS rely on a stratified, multi-stage cluster sample design. Standard errors should becalculated by taking this �design effect� into consideration. Failure to take it into accountwill compromise statistical tests. Calculating standard errors by assuming a simplerandom sample (which is the default in most statistical software packages) when in fact acluster sample was used results in standard errors that are smaller than when takingcluster sampling into consideration. Further, estimates are generally computed onweighted rather than raw data, which are sums of the weights of the cases selected.Computing standard errors on these sums as if they were independent observations wouldproduce artificially small results and thus compromise the statistical tests involved.Calculation of the standard errors requires procedures that are markedly different fromthe ones used when the data are from a simple random sample. One can use directvariance calculation methods designed for complex survey designs (See NationalCrime Victimization Codebook, 1992-2003 [ICPSR 3995], 2005), or compute statisticsand standard errors by using generalized variance function (gvf) constant parameters.The gvf represents the curve fitted to the individual standard errors calculated using the26Jackknife Repeated Replication technique.3 The three constant parameters (a, b, and c)derived from the curve fitting process are provided below for those who prefer to use thisalternative method of calculating standard errors:Year a b c1989 0.00001559 3,108 0.0001995 -0.00006269 2,278 1.8041999 -0.00026646 2,579 2.8262001 0.00011330 2803 2.9052003 -0.00029301 3059 2.872To calculate the standard errors associated with percentages, the following formula isused:standard error of p =where p is the percentage of interest expressed as a proportion and y is the size of thepopulation to which the percentage applies. Once the standard error of the proportion isestimated, it needs to be multiplied by 100 to make it applicable to the percentage.To calculate the adjusted standard errors associated with population counts, the3 A more detailed description of the generalized variance function constant parameters developed for theNCVS and SCS can be found in National Crime Victimization Codebook, 1992-2003 [ICPSR 3995], 2005.27following applies:standard error of x =where x is the estimated number of students who experienced a given event (e.g.,violent victimization).The U.S. Bureau of the Census has developed a set of programs to calculate NCVSgeneralized variance formulae, known as SIGMA programs. To facilitate use of theseformulae, spreadsheet versions of these SIGMA programs are available on the BJS website (www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/), which will allow users to enter gvf constants and values inappropriate cells. Spreadsheet macros will them calculate the appropriate variances andstandard errors and perform tests for any differences requested.28Reference List of Articles Related to the School Crime Supplements,1989, 1995, 1999, 2001 and 2003Bastian, Lisa D. and Bruce M.

Thefollowing is a summary of the changes to the 2003 NCVS/SCS record layout, since thequarters 1-2, 2001 NCVS/SCS record layout :NCVS changes beginning quarter 3, 2001$We added a file creation date stamp field to record the date the public use file (PUF)was created. This will enable users to easily identify files when revisions are issued.The file creation date field is located in positions 23-30 and is formatted as mmddyyyy.$For item 10 (source code (SC) 616) on the NCVS-2, Crime Incident Report, we removedanswer category 13 (Inside other commercial building such as a store, bank, gasstation) and replaced it with new individual answer categories 24 (Inside bank), 25(Inside gas station), and 26 (Inside other commercial building such as a store). We alsorenamed answer category 14 from AInside office, factory, or warehouse@ to AInsideoffice@ and added the new answer category 27 (Inside factory or warehouse).$For item 70 (SC 707) and item 84 (SCs 723-725) on the NCVS-2, we renamed answercategory 12 (Someone at work, customer) to ACustomer/client@. We also added newanswer categories 14 (Patient), 15 (Supervisor(current or former)), 16(Employee(current or former)) and 17 (Co-worker(current or former)).$For item 158 (SCs 891-892) on the NCVS-2, we added new answer categories11 (Customer/client), 12 (Patient), 13 (Supervisor(current or former)), 14(Employee(current or former)), and 15 (Co-worker(current or former)).NCVS changes beginning quarter 1, 2003$All race data items were changed from single-entry response items to multiple-entryresponse items in an effort to comply with the Office of Management and Budget=s 1997directive on race and ethnicity. The answer categories for the race item were alsoexpanded from 5 categories to 6 as follows:Race categories prior to quarter 1,2003Race categories beginning quarter 1, 2003WhiteBlackAmerican Indian, Aleut, EskimoAsian or Pacific IslanderOtherWhiteBlack or African AmericanAmerican Indian or Alaskan NativeAsianNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific IslanderOther$All race data released on the 2003 NCVS/SCS PUF are recoded into a two-digit race32recode. Please refer to the public use file documentation for specific recode values.Beginning in quarter 1, 2003 and thereafter, we no longer release originally reportedrace data (SC412O).$We combined item 25a (SC409), Education-highest grade or year attended, and item25b (SC410), Education-complete that grade (year), into a single item 25 (SC409),Educational attainment, on the NCVS-1. Also, the answer categories for item 25 wereexpanded for the 12th grade and higher educational degrees. Item 25b (SC410) nolonger exists.$In late 2002, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the sponsor of the NCVS, requested theinclusion of recoded hate crime data and select hate crime data items 46h (SCs564569) and 46i (SC587 and SC589) from the NCVS-1 as well as data items 162 (SCs896901)and 163 (SC911 and SC913) from the NCVS-2 on the NCVS PUF beginningquarter 1, 2003.Changes to the 2003 SCS$We added item 19b (SC120). This question asks how often a respondent has beenbullied at school during the last 6 months.$The maximum number of incidents reported by a single SCS respondent in 2003increased to 9 incidents. This is two incidents more than the maximum number of 7incidents reported in 2001. Incident data begins in position 497. Each incident record is633 characters in length.General Notes on the NCVS/SCS PUF:True blanks are identified by 9's within the documentation. A true blank indicates that an itemwas out of universe, that is, the item should not have been asked of a respondent. This ismost frequently the result of circumventing specific questions based on the skip pattern.Noninterview persons contain true blanks throughout the data file for most items since noquestions were asked of them. Please note, true blanks are listed as valid values in thedocumentation when a true blank is the only value that should exist for that item. For example,SC217, which identifies the race of the household head for a noninterview record will always bea true blank because only NCVS records for interview households are contained on the SCSpublic use file. 33VARIABLE DESCRIPTION LISTFor Household and Person VariablesVar Description LocationV1 SAMPLE NUMBER 1 - 2V2 SCRAMBLED CONTROL NUMBER 3 - 16V3 HOUSEHOLD NUMBER 17 - 17V4 ROTATION GROUP 18 - 19V5 YEAR AND QUARTER 20 - 22V6 FILE CREATION DATE (MMDDYYYY) 23 - 30V7 UNIT STATUS 31 - 31V8 HOUSEHOLD STATUS 32 - 32V9 LINE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLD RESPONDENT 33 - 34V10 SPECIAL PLACE/GROUP QUARTERS TYPE CODE 35 - 36V11 TENURE (ORIGINAL) 37 - 37V12 TENURE (ALLOCATED) 38 - 38V13 LAND USE (ORIGINAL) 39 - 39V14 LAND USE (ALLOCATED) 40 - 40V15 FARM SALES (ORIGINAL) 41 - 41V16 FARM SALES (ALLOCATED) 42 - 42V17 TYPE OF LIVING QUARTERS (ORIGINAL) 43 - 44V18 TYPE OF LIVING QUARTERS (ALLOCATED) 45 - 46V19 LOCATION OF PHONE 47 - 47V20 IS PHONE INTERVIEW ACCEPTABLE 48 - 48V21 NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS IN STRUCTURE 49 - 50V22 DIRECT OUTSIDE ACCESS 51 - 51V23 HOUSEHOLD INCOME 52 - 53V24 MONTH NONINTERVIEW COMPLETED 54 - 55V25 DAY NONINTERVIEW COMPLETED 56 - 57V26 YEAR NONINTERVIEW COMPLETED 58 - 59V27 REASON FOR HOUSEHOLD NONINTERVIEW 60 - 61V28 RACE RECODE FOR THE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD (TYPE A) 62 - 63V29 COLLEGE/UNIVERSITY 64 - 64V30 PUBLIC HOUSING 65 - 65V31 MANAGER VERIFICATION OF PUBLIC HOUSING 66 - 66V32 AMERICAN INDIAN RESERVATION/LANDS 67 - 67V33 LINE NO.
