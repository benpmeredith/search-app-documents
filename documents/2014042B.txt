Executive Summary
Introduction
Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for
teaching and learning, free of crime and violence. Any
instance of crime or violence at school not only affects
the individuals involved, but also may disrupt the
educational process and affect bystanders, the school
itself, and the surrounding community (Brookmeyer,
Fanti, and Henrich 2006; Goldstein, Young, and
Boyd 2008).
Establishing reliable indicators of the current state
of school crime and safety across the nation and
regularly updating and monitoring these indicators
are important in ensuring the safety of our nation’s
students. This is the aim of Indicators of School Crime
and Safety.
This report is the sixteenth in a series of annual publications produced jointly by the National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES), Institute of Education
Sciences (IES), in the U.S. Department of Education,
and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) in the U.S.
Department of Justice. This report presents the most
recent data available on school crime and student
safety. The indicators in this report are based on
information drawn from a variety of data sources,
including national surveys of students, teachers,
principals, and postsecondary institutions. Sources
include results from the School-Associated Violent
Deaths Study, sponsored by the U.S. Department
of Education, the Department of Justice, and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the
National Crime Victimization Survey and School
Crime Supplement to that survey, sponsored by BJS
and NCES, respectively; the Youth Risk Behavior
Survey, sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention; the Schools and Staffing Survey
and School Survey on Crime and Safety, both
sponsored by NCES; and the Campus Safety and
Security Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department
of Education. The most recent data collection for
each indicator varied by survey, from 2009 to 2012.
Each data source has an independent sample design,
data collection method, and questionnaire design,
or is the result of a universe data collection. All
comparisons described in this report are statistically
significant at the .05 level. Additional information
about methodology and the datasets analyzed in this
report may be found in appendix A.
This report covers topics such as victimization,
teacher injury, bullying and cyber-bullying, school
conditions, fights, weapons, availability and student

use of drugs and alcohol, student perceptions of
personal safety at school, and criminal incidents
at postsecondary institutions. Indicators of crime
and safety are compared across different population
subgroups and over time. Data on crimes that occur
away from school are offered as a point of comparison
where available.

Key Findings
Preliminary data show that there were 31 schoolassociated violent deaths1 from July 1, 2010, through
June 30, 2011 (Indicator 1). In 2012, among students
ages 12–18, there were about 1,364,900 nonfatal
victimizations at school, 2 which include 615,600
victims of theft3 and 749,200 victims of violence4
(simple assault and serious violence5) (Indicator
2). During the 2011–12 school year, 88 percent of
public schools reported that they controlled access
to school buildings by locking or monitoring doors
during school hours, and 64 percent reported that
they used security cameras to monitor the school. In
the 2009–10 school year, 43 percent of public schools
reported the presence of one or more security staff at
their school at least once a week during the school
year (Indicator 20).
The following key findings are drawn from each
section of the report.
Violent Deaths

»

Of the 31 student, staff, and nonstudent
school-associated violent deaths occurring
between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2011,

1

 A “school-associated violent death” is defined as “a
homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law
enforcement officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on
the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school
in the United States, while the victim was on the way to
or from regular sessions at school or while the victim was
attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored
event.” Victims of school-associated violent deaths included
students, staff members, and others who are not students.
2
  “At school” includes inside the school building, on school
property, or on the way to or from school.
3
 “Theft” includes attempted and completed pursesnatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and
completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts.
Theft does not include robbery, which involves the threat or
use of force and is classified as a violent crime.
4
  “Violent victimization” includes serious violent crimes and
simple assault.
5
  “Serious violent victimization” includes the crimes of rape,
sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2013

there were 25 homicides and 6 suicides.
During the same time period, there were
11 homicides and 3 suicides of school-age youth
(ages 5–18) at school (Indicator 1).

»

»

During the 2010–11 school year, 11 of the 1,336
homicides among school-age youth ages 5–18
occurred at school.6 During the 2010 calendar
year, 3 of the 1,456 suicides of youth ages 5–18
occurred at school (Indicator 1).

Between 1995 and 2011, the total percentage of
students ages 12–18 who reported being victimized
at school, as well as the percentages of students who
reported theft, violent victimization, and serious
violent victimization, decreased (Indicator 3).

Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization

»

Four percent of students ages 12–18 reported
being v ict imi z ed at school du ring t he
previous 6 months in 2011. Three percent of
students reported theft, 1 percent reported
violent victimization, and one-tenth of
1 percent reported serious violent victimization
(Indicator 3).

Between 1992 and 2012, the total victimization
rates for students ages 12–18 generally declined
both at school (from 181 to 52 per 1,000) and
away from school (from 173 to 38 per 1,000). This
pattern also held for thefts, violent victimizations,
and serious violent victimizations (Indicator 2).

In 2011, a higher percentage of students ages
12–18 attending public schools reported being
victimized than students attending private
schools (4 vs. 2 percent; Indicator 3).

In 2012, students ages 12–18 were victims of
about 1,364,900 nonfatal victimizations at
school,7 including 615,600 thefts8 and 749,200
violent victimizations,9 89,000 of which were
serious violent victimizations10 (Indicator 2).

Seven percent of students in grades 9–12 reported
being threatened or injured with a weapon, such
as a gun, knife, or club, on school property11 in
2011. Specifically, 3 percent of students were
threatened or injured with a weapon 1 time, 2
percent were threatened or injured with a weapon
2 or 3 times, 1 percent were threatened or injured
with a weapon 4 to 11 times, and 1 percent were
threatened or injured with a weapon 12 or more
times (Indicator 4).

In 2012, a greater number of students ages
12–18 experienced victimizations (theft and
violent crime) at school than away from school.
That year, 52 victimizations per 1,000 students
occurred at school, and 38 victimizations per
1,000 students occurred away from school
(Indicator 2).
The rates of total victimization at and away from
school were greater for males than for females
ages 12–18 in 2012 (Indicator 2).

In each survey year, a higher percentage of males
than females in grades 9–12 reported being
threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property. For example, in 2011, approximately 10
percent of males and 5 percent of females were
threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property. These percentages were not measurably
different from the percentages of males and
females who were threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property in 2009 (Indicator 4).

Executive Summary

In 2012, students ages 12–18 residing in urban
or suburban areas had higher rates of violent
victimization at school than those residing in
rural areas (Indicator 2).

During the 2011–12 school year, a higher
percentage of public than private school
teachers reported being threatened with injury
(10 vs. 3 percent) or being physically attacked
(6 vs. 3 percent) by a student from their school
(Indicator 5).
11

 “On school property” was not defined for survey
respondents.

»

Ten percent of elementary teachers and 9 percent
of secondary teachers reported being threatened
by a student from their school in 2011–12. The
percentage of elementary teachers who reported
being physically attacked by a student was higher
than the percentage of secondary teachers (8 vs.
3 percent; Indicator 5).

School Environment

»

During the 2009–10 school year, 85 percent of
public schools recorded that one or more crime
incidents had taken place at school,12 amounting
to an estimated 1.9 million crimes. This translates
to a rate of 40 crimes per 1,000 public school
students enrolled in 2009–10. During the same
year, 60 percent of public schools reported a crime
incident that occurred at school to the police,
amounting to 689,000 crimes—or 15 crimes per
1,000 public school students enrolled (Indicator 6).
In 2009–10, about 74 percent of public schools
recorded one or more violent incidents of crime,
16 percent recorded one or more serious violent
incidents, 44 percent recorded one or more
thefts, and 68 percent recorded one or more
other incidents.13 Forty percent of public schools
reported at least one violent incident to police,
10 percent reported at least one serious violent
incident to police, 25 percent reported at least
one theft to police, and 46 percent reported one
or more other incidents to police (Indicator 6).
During the 2009–10 school year, 23 percent of
public schools reported that bullying occurred
among students on a daily or weekly basis,
and 3 percent reported widespread disorder in
classrooms on a daily or weekly basis (Indicator 7).
Sixteen percent of public schools reported that
gang activities had occurred during the 2009–10
school year, and 2 percent reported that cult or
extremist activities had occurred during this
period. The percentages of public schools that
reported gang activity at all at their schools during

 “At school” was defined for respondents to include
activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds,
on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored
events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include
incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school
hours or when school activities or events were in session.
13
 “Other incidents” include possession of a firearm or
explosive device; possession of a knife or sharp object;
distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol;
vandalism; and inappropriate distribution, possession, or use
of prescription drugs.

the school year decreased from 20 percent in
2007–08 to 16 percent in 2009–10 (Indicator 7).

»

Nine percent of public schools reported that student
acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal
abuse occurred at least once a week in 2009–10,
lower than the 11 percent in 2007–08 (Indicator 7).
The percentage of students ages 12–18 who
reported that gangs were present at their school
decreased from 20 percent in 2009 to 18 percent
in 2011. A higher percentage of students from
urban areas (23 percent) reported a gang presence
than students from suburban (16 percent) and
rural areas (12 percent) in 2011. The percentage
of students from urban areas who reported a gang
presence decreased from 31 percent in 2009 to
23 percent in 2011 (Indicator 8).
In 2011, approximately 19 percent of students
ages 12–18 attending public schools reported that
gangs were present at their school, compared with
2 percent of students attending private schools. The
percentage of private school students who reported
a gang presence at their school was not measurably
different between the two most recent survey
years, 2009 and 2011 (2 percent in each year). In
contrast, the percentage of public school students
who reported a gang presence decreased from 22
percent in 2009 to 19 percent in 2011 (Indicator 8).
The percentage of students in grades 9–12 who
reported that illegal drugs were offered, sold, or
given to them decreased from 32 percent in 1995
to 26 percent in 2011. The percentage of students
who reported that drugs were made available to
them on school property in 2011 (26 percent) was
higher than in 2009 (23 percent; Indicator 9).
In 2011, a higher percentage of 10th-graders
reported that illegal drugs were made available
to them on school property than 9th-graders or
12th-graders. In addition, higher percentages
of American Indian/Alaska Native students
(40 percent), Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian
students (39 percent), and Hispanic students and
students of two or more races (33 percent each),
than White, Black, or Asian students (23 percent
each) reported that drugs were offered, sold, or
given to them on school property (Indicator 9).
The percentage of students ages 12–18 who
reported being the target of hate-related words
decreased from 12 percent in 2001 to 9 percent
in 2011, and the percentage of students who
reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school

12–18 reporting bullying at school; however, a
higher percentage of students reported being
bullied in 2007 (32 percent) than in 2005, 2009,
and 2011 (28 percent in each year; Indicator 11).

In 2011, there were no measurable differences
in the percentages of students ages 12–18 who
reported being called hate-related words or who
reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school by
race/ethnicity. Eight percent of White students, 9
percent of Asian students, 10 percent of Hispanic
students, and 11 percent of Black students
reported being called a hate-related word. Twentyeight percent each of Black and White students,
29 percent of Hispanic students, and 30 percent
of Asian students reported seeing hate-related
graffiti at school in 2011 (Indicator 10).

The percentage of teachers who reported that
student misbehavior interfered with their teaching
f luctuated between 1993–94 and 2011–12;
however, the percentage of teachers reporting that
student tardiness and class cutting interfered with
their teaching increased over this time period (from
25 to 35 percent). Between 1993–94 and 2011–12,
the percentage of teachers who reported that school
rules were enforced by other teachers fluctuated
between 64 and 73 percent, and the percentage who
reported that rules were enforced by the principal
fluctuated between 82 and 89 percent (Indicator 12)

In 2011, about 28 percent of 12- to 18-year-old
students reported being bullied at school during the
school year. A higher percentage of females than of
males ages 12–18 reported that they were made fun
of, called names, or insulted (19 vs. 16 percent), were
the subject of rumors (24 vs. 13 percent), and were
excluded from activities on purpose (6 vs. 5 percent).
The percentage of males (9 percent) who reported
being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on was higher
than the percentage of females who reported the
same bullying problem (7 percent; Indicator 11).
In 2011, a higher percentage of students in 6th
grade than of students in grades 7 through 12
reported being bullied at school during the
school year. About 37 percent of 6th-graders
reported being bullied at school, compared
with 30 percent of 7th-graders, 31 percent of
8th-graders, 26 percent of 9th-graders, 28 percent
of 10th-graders, 24 percent of 11th-graders, and
22 percent of 12th-graders (Indicator 11).
In 2011, approximately 9 percent of students ages
12–18 reported being cyber-bullied anywhere during
the school year. Of those students, about 4 percent
each reported that another student had posted
hurtful information on the Internet and reported
being the subject of harassing text messages. Female
students reported being the victims of these types of
cyber-bullying problems at higher percentages than
males in 2011. For example, 6 percent of females
versus 2 percent of males reported that another
student posted hurtful information about them on
the Internet, and the same percentages of females
and males, respectively, reported being the subject
of harassing text messages (Indicator 11).
Overall and for most student and school
characteristics, no pattern was observed between
2005 and 2011 in the percentages of students ages
vi

Executive Summary

In 2011–12, about 38 percent of teachers agreed
or strongly agreed that student misbehavior
interfered with their teaching, and 35 percent
reported that student tardiness and class cutting
interfered with their teaching. Sixty-nine percent
of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that other
teachers at their school enforced the school
rules, and 84 percent reported that the principal
enforced the school rules (Indicator 12).

A higher percentage of public school teachers (41
percent) than of private school teachers (22 percent)
reported that student misbehavior interfered with
their teaching in 2011–12. In addition, 38 percent
of public school teachers reported that student
tardiness and class cutting interfered with their
teaching, compared with 19 percent of private school
teachers. During the same year, lower percentages of
public school teachers than of private school teachers
agreed that school rules were enforced by teachers
(68 vs. 77 percent) and by the principal in their
school (84 vs. 89 percent; Indicator 12).

Fights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances

»

In 2011, about 33 percent of students in grades
9–12 reported they had been in a physical fight
at least one time during the previous 12 months
anywhere, and 12 percent said they had been in
a fight on school property during the previous 12
months. Generally, a higher percentage of students
in 9th grade reported having been in fights than
students in any other grade, both anywhere and
on school property. A smaller percentage of Asian
students reported being in fights anywhere and
on school property than students of other racial/
ethnic groups. In addition, 4 percent of males said

they had been in a fight anywhere twelve or more
times, compared to 1 percent of females, and 1
percent of males said they had been in a fight on
school property twelve or more times, compared
to less than half a percent of females (Indicator 13).

»

Between 1993 and 2011, the percentage of students
in grades 9–12 who reported carrying a weapon
anywhere on at least 1 day during the past 30 days
declined from 22 percent to 17 percent, and the
percentage who reported carrying a weapon on
school property on at least 1 day also declined,
from 12 percent to 5 percent (Indicator 14).

reported using marijuana on school property at
least one time over the same time period. The
2011 percentages of students who reported using
marijuana anywhere and on school property
were higher than in 2009. In addition, in ever
survey year, higher percentages of males than
females reported using marijuana anywhere and
on school property (Indicator 16).

»

In 2011, among students in grades 9–12, 26
percent of males reported carrying a weapon
anywhere, compared to 7 percent of females, and
8 percent of males reported carrying a weapon
on school property, compared to 2 percent of
females (Indicator 14).
The percentage of students in grades 9–12 reporting
that they had access to a gun without adult permission
was lower in 2009 and 2011 (6 percent and 5
percent, respectively) than it was in 2007 (7 percent).
In all three survey years, a higher percentage of
male students than female students reported having
access to a gun without adult permission. For
example, in 2011, about 6 percent of males reported
having access to a gun without adult permission,
compared to 4 percent of females (Indicator 14).
From 2009 to 2011, there were no measurable
changes in the percentages of male students who
reported alcohol consumption anywhere or on school
property. Among females, however, the percentage
of students in grades 9–12 who reported consuming
alcohol anywhere decreased from 43 percent in
2009 to 38 percent in 2011, and the percentage of
female students who reported consuming alcohol on
school property increased from 4 percent in 2009
to 5 percent in 2011 (Indicator 15).
In 2011, about 39 percent of students in grades
9–12 reported having at least one drink of alcohol
anywhere during the previous 30 days, and 5
percent had at least one drink on school property
(Indicator 15).
In 2011, some 23 percent of students in grades
9–12 reported using marijuana anywhere at least
one time in the previous 30 days and 6 percent

The percentage of Asian students in grades 9–12
who reported using marijuana anywhere at least
one time during the previous 30 days was lower
than that of other racial/ethnic groups in 2011.
Fourteen percent of Asian students reported
using marijuana anywhere, compared with
22 percent of White students; 24 percent of
Hispanic students; 25 percent of Black students;
27 percent of students of two or more races; 31
percent of Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian
students; and 47 percent of American Indian/
Alaska Native students (Indicator 16).

Fear and Avoidance

»

Between 1995 and 2011, the percentage of
students ages 12–18 who reported being afraid
of attack or harm at school decreased from 12 to
4 percent (Indicator 17).
In 2011, a higher percentage of students ages
12–18 reported that they were afraid of attack or
harm at school (4 percent) than away from school
(2 percent) during the school year (Indicator 17).
Student reports on their fears about their
safety varied by race/ethnicity in 2011. A lower
percentage of White students ages 12–18 (3
percent) than of Hispanic students (5 percent)
reported being afraid of attack or harm at school,
and a lower percentage of White students (2
percent) than of Black and Hispanic students (3
percent each) reported being afraid of attack or
harm away from school (Indicator 17).
The percentage of students ages 12–18 who
reported that they had avoided at least one school
activity or one or more places in school during
the previous school year because of fear of attack
or harm was not measurably different between
2009 (5 percent) and 2011 (6 percent). In 2011,
about 2 percent of students avoided at least one
school activity, and 5 percent avoided one or more

In 2011, nearly all students ages 12–18 reported
that they had observed security measures at their
schools.15 Most students ages 12–18 reported
that their schools had a code of student conduct
(96 percent) and a requirement that visitors sign
in (95 percent). Approximately 89 percent of
students reported the presence of other school
staff or other adult supervision in the hallway,
77 percent reported the presence of one or more
security cameras to monitor the school, and 70
percent reported the presence of security guards
and/or assigned police officers. Metal detectors
were the least observed of the selected safety
and security measures: 11 percent of students
reported the use of metal detectors at their schools
(Indicator 21).

Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures

»

During the 2009–10 school year, 39 percent of
public schools (about 32,300 schools) took at least
one serious disciplinary action against a student for
specific offenses. Of the 433,800 serious disciplinary
actions taken during the 2009–10 school year, 74
percent were suspensions for 5 days or more, 20
percent were transfers to specialized schools, and
6 percent were removals with no services for the
remainder of the school year (Indicator 19).
Between the 2003–04 and 2011–12 school
yea rs, t he percenta ge of public schools
reporting that they required that students wear
uniforms increased from 13 to 19 percent. Also,
the percentages of public schools reporting
the following security measures were higher
in 2011–12 than in 2003–04: using security
cameras to monitor the school; controlling
access to buildings during school hours;
and controlling access to grounds during school
hours (Indicator 20).

Seventy-seven percent of students ages 12–18
reported observing the use of one or more
security cameras at their schools in 2011, which
represented an increase from 70 percent in 2009
as well as an overall increase from 39 percent in
2001 (Indicator 21).
Postsecondary Campus Safety and Security

»

During the 2011–12 school year, 88 percent of
public schools reported that they controlled access
to school buildings by locking or monitoring
doors during school hours, and 64 percent
reported that they used security cameras to
monitor the school (Indicator 20).

The number of disciplinary referrals for drug
law violations reported by public and private
2-year and 4-year postsecondary institutions
increased from 20.5 per 10,000 students in
2001 to 33.8 per 10,000 students in 2011. Also,
the number of referrals for liquor law violations
per 10,000 students was higher in 2011 (128.1)
than in 2001 (111.3). In contrast, the number of
referrals per 10,000 students for illegal weapons
possession was lower in 2011 (0.9) than in 2001
(1.1; Indicator 22).

During the 2009–10 school year, 43 percent of
public schools reported the presence of one or
more security staff at their school at least once
a week during the school year. Twenty-nine
percent of schools reported having at least one
full-time employed security staff member who
was present at least once a week, and 14 percent
of schools reported having only part-time staff.
Twenty-eight percent of all schools reported the
presence of security staff routinely carrying a
firearm at school (Indicator 20).

The number of arrests for drug law violations
reported by public and private 2-year and 4-year
postsecondary institutions increased from 10.2

14

 “Avoided school activities” includes avoiding any
(extracurricular) activities, skipping class, or staying home
from school. In 2007, 2009, and 2011, the survey wording
was changed from “any extracurricular activities” to “any
activities.” Please use caution when comparing changes in
this item over time. “Avoiding one or more places in school”
includes avoiding the entrance, any hallways or stairs, parts
of the cafeteria, restrooms, and other places inside the school
building.

Executive Summary

In 2011, there were 30,400 criminal incidents
at public and private 2-year and 4-year
postsecondary institutions that were reported
to police and security agencies, representing a
5 percent decrease from 2010 (31,900). There
was also a decrease in the number of crimes per
10,000 full-time-equivalent students, from 20.8
in 2010 to 19.7 in 2011 (Indicator 22).

Readers should note that this indicator relies on student
reports of security measures and provides estimates based
on students’ awareness of the measure rather than on
documented practice. See Indicator 20 for a summary of the
use of various security measures as reported by schools.

per 10,000 students in 2001 to 13.5 per 10,000
students in 2011. However, the number of arrests
per 10,000 students was lower in 2011 than in

2001 for liquor law violations (21.3 vs. 23.5) as
well as for illegal weapons possession (0.7 vs. 0.9;
Indicator 22).

Foreword
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2013 provides
the most recent national indicators on school crime
and safety. The information presented in this report
is intended to serve as a reference for policymakers
and practitioners so that they can develop effective programs and policies aimed at violence and
school crime prevention. Accurate information
about the nature, extent, and scope of the problem
being addressed is essential for developing effective
programs and policies.
This is the sixteenth edition of Indicators of School
Crime and Safety, a joint publication of the Bureau
of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES). This report provides
detailed statistics to inform the nation about current
aspects of crime and safety in schools.
The 2013 edition of Indicators of School Crime
and Safety includes the most recent available data,
compiled from a number of statistical data sources
supported by the federal government. Such sources
include results from the School-Associated Violent
Deaths Study, sponsored by the U.S. Department
of Education, the Department of Justice, and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

(CDC); the National Crime Victimization Survey
and School Crime Supplement to the survey,
sponsored by the BJS and NCES, respectively; the
Youth Risk Behavior Survey, sponsored by the CDC;
the Schools and Staffing Survey and School Survey
on Crime and Safety, both sponsored by NCES, and
the Campus Safety and Security Survey, sponsored
by the U.S. Department of Education.
The entire report is available on the Internet
(http://nces.ed.gov/programs/crimeindicators/
crimeindicators2013/). The Bureau of Justice
Statistics and the National Center for Education
Statistics continue to work together in order to
provide timely and complete data on the issues of
school-related violence and safety.

Introduction

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2013

1

Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for
teaching and learning free of crime and violence.
Any instance of crime or violence at school not only
affects the individuals involved but also may disrupt
the educational process and affect bystanders, the
school itself, and the surrounding community
(Brookmeyer, Fanti, and Henrich 2006; Goldstein,
Young, and Boyd 2008). For both students and
teachers, victimization at school can have lasting
effects. In addition to experiencing loneliness, depression, and adjustment difficulties (Crick and Bigbee
1998; Crick and Grotpeter 1996; Nansel et al. 2001;
Prinstein, Boergers, and Vernberg 2001; Storch et
al. 2003), victimized children are more prone to
truancy (Ringwalt, Ennett, and Johnson 2003),
poor academic performance (MacMillan and Hagan
2004; Wei and Williams 2004), dropping out of
school (Beauvais et al. 1996; MacMillan and Hagan
2004), and violent behaviors (Nansel et al. 2003).
For teachers, incidents of victimization may lead to
professional disenchantment and even departure from
the profession altogether (Karcher 2002; Smith and
Smith 2006).
For parents, school staff, and policymakers to effectively address school crime, they need an accurate
understanding of the extent, nature, and context
of the problem. However, it is difficult to gauge the
scope of crime and violence in schools given the large
amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of
extreme school violence. Measuring progress toward
safer schools requires establishing good indicators of
the current state of school crime and safety across
the nation and regularly updating and monitoring
these indicators; this is the aim of Indicators of School
Crime and Safety.

Purpose and Organization of This Report
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2013 is the
sixteenth in a series of reports produced since 1998
by the National Center for Education Statistics
(NCES) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)
that present the most recent data available on school
crime and student safety. Although the data presented
in this report are the most recent data available at the
time of publication, the data do not cover the most
recent two or more school years. The report is not
intended to be an exhaustive compilation of school
crime and safety information, nor does it attempt
to explore reasons for crime and violence in schools.
Rather, it is designed to provide a brief summary
of information from an array of data sources and
to make data on national school crime and safety
accessible to policymakers, educators, parents, and
the general public.
2

Introduction

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2013 is
organized into sections that delineate specific
concerns to readers, starting with a description of the
most serious violent crimes. The sections cover violent
deaths; nonfatal student and teacher victimization;
school environment; fights, weapons, and illegal
substances; fear and avoidance; discipline, safety, and
security measures, and campus safety and security.
Each section contains a set of indicators that, taken
together, aim to describe a distinct aspect of school
crime and safety. Where available, data on crimes
that occur outside of school grounds are offered as
a point of comparison.1 Supplemental tables for
each indicator provide more detailed breakouts and
standard errors for estimates. A glossary of terms and
a reference section appear at the end of the report.
This edition of the report contains updated data for
five indicators: violent deaths at school and away from
school (Indicator 1), incidence of victimization at
school and away from school (Indicator 2), teachers’
reports of being threatened with injury or being
physically attacked by students (Indicator 5), teachers’
reports on school conditions (Indicator 12), and safety
and security measures taken by public and private
schools (Indicator 20).
In addition, this year’s report introduces a new
indicator on criminal incidents at postsecondary
institutions (Indicator 22).
Also included in this year’s report are references to
publications relevant to each indicator that the reader
may want to consult for additional information or
analyses. These references can be found in the “For
more information” sidebars at the bottom of each
indicator.

Data
The indicators in this report are based on information drawn from a variety of independent data
sources, including national surveys of students,
teachers, principals, and postsecondary institutions
and universe data collections from federal departments and agencies, including BJS, NCES, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, and the Office of
Postsecondary Education. Each data source has an
independent sample design, data collection method,
and questionnaire design, or is the result of a universe
data collection.

  Data in this report are not adjusted to reflect the number
of hours that youths spend on school property versus the
number of hours they spend elsewhere.

The combination of multiple, independent sources
of data provides a broad perspective on school crime
and safety that could not be achieved through any
single source of information. However, readers should
be cautious when comparing data from different
sources. While every effort has been made to keep key
definitions consistent across indicators, differences in
sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and
question phrasing can all affect the comparability
of results. For example, both Indicators 20 and 21
report data on selected security and safety measures
used in schools. Indicator 20 uses data collected
from a schools and staffing survey administered to
public and private school principals about safety
and security practices used in their schools for the
2011–12 school year, as well as from a survey of public
school principals about safety and security practices
used in their schools during the 2009–10 school
year. The schools range from primary through high
schools. Indicator 21, however, uses data collected
from 12- through 18-year-old students residing in
a sample of households. These students were asked
whether they observed selected safety and security
measures in their school in 2011, but they may not
have known whether, in fact, the security measure
was present. In addition, different indicators contain
various approaches to the analysis of school crime
data and, therefore, will show different perspectives
on school crime. For example, both Indicators 2 and 3
report data on theft and violent crime at school based
on the National Crime Victimization Survey and the
School Crime Supplement to that survey, respectively.
While Indicator 2 examines the number of incidents
of crime, Indicator 3 examines the percentage or
prevalence of students who reported victimization.
Table A provides a summary of some of the variations
in the design and coverage of sample surveys used in
this report.
Several indicators in this report are based on selfreported survey data. Readers should note that
limitations inherent to self-reported data may affect
estimates (Addington 2005; Cantor and Lynch 2000).
First, unless an interview is “bounded” or a reference
period is established, estimates may include events
that exceed the scope of the specified reference period.
This factor may artificially increase reported incidents
because respondents may recall events outside of the
given reference period. Second, many of the surveys
rely on the respondent to “self-determine” a condition.
This factor allows the respondent to define a situation
based upon his or her own interpretation of whether
the incident was a crime or not. On the other hand,
the same situation may not necessarily be interpreted
in the same way by a bystander or the perceived

offender. Third, victim surveys tend to emphasize
crime events as incidents that take place at one point in
time. However, victims can often experience a state of
victimization in which they are threatened or victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally, respondents may
recall an event inaccurately. For instance, people may
forget the event entirely or recall the specifics of the
episode incorrectly. These and other factors may affect
the precision of the estimates based on these surveys.
Data trends are discussed in this report when possible.
Where trends are not discussed, either the data
are not available in earlier surveys or the wording
of the survey question changed from year to year,
eliminating the ability to discuss any trend.
Where data from samples are reported, as is the
case with most of the indicators in this report, the
standard error is calculated for each estimate provided
in order to determine the “margin of error” for these
estimates. The standard errors of the estimates for
different subpopulations in an indicator can vary
considerably and should be taken into account when
making comparisons. With the exception of Indicator
2, in this report, in cases where the standard error
was between 30 and 50 percent of the associated
estimate, the estimates were noted with a “!” symbol
(Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of
variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and
50 percent). In Indicator 2, the “!” symbol cautions
the reader that estimates marked indicate that the
reported statistic was based on fewer than 10 cases.
With the exception of Indicator 2, in cases where
the standard error was 50 percent or greater of the
associated estimate, the estimate was suppressed
(Reporting standards not met. Either there are too
few cases for a reliable estimate or the coefficient
of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater). See
appendix A for more information.
The appearance of a “!” symbol (Interpret data with
caution) in a table or figure indicates a data cell with
a high ratio of standard error to estimate so the reader
should use caution when interpreting such data.
These estimates are still discussed, however, when
statistically significant differences are found despite
large standard errors.
The comparisons in the text have been tested for
statistical significance to ensure that the differences
are larger than might be expected due to sampling
variation. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons
cited in the report are statistically significant at the .05
level. Several test procedures were used, depending
upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2013

of the comparison being tested. The primary test
procedure used in this report was Student’s t statistic,
which tests the difference between two sample
estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for
multiple comparisons. Linear trend tests were used
to examine changes in percentages over a range of
values such as time or age. Linear trends tests allow
one to examine whether, for example, the percentage
of students who reported using drugs increased (or
decreased) over time or whether the percentage of
students who reported being physically attacked
in school increased (or decreased) with age. When
differences among percentages were examined relative
to a variable with ordinal categories (such as grade),
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a
linear relationship between the two variables.
Table A.	

Percentages reported in the tables and figures
are generally rounded to one decimal place (e.g.,
76.5 percent), while percentages reported in the text
are generally rounded from the original number to
whole numbers (with any value of 0.50 or above
rounded to the next highest whole number). While
the data labels on the figures have been rounded to
one decimal place, the graphical presentation of these
data is based on the unrounded estimates.
Appendix A of this report contains descriptions of all
the datasets used in this report and a discussion of
how standard errors were calculated for each estimate.

Indicator 1
Violent Deaths at School and Away From School
Over all available survey years, the percentage of youth homicides occurring at school remained at less than
2 percent of the total number of youth homicides, and the percentage of youth suicides occurring at school
remained at less than 1 percent of the total number of youth suicides.
Violent deaths at schools are rare but tragic events
with far-reaching effects on the school population
and surrounding community. Indicator 1 presents
data on school-associated violent deaths that were
collected using the School-Associated Violent Deaths
Study (SAVD). The most recent data released for the
SAVD survey cover the period from July 1, 2010,
through June 30, 2011.
More recent information gathered from media
reports can provide preliminary estimates on the
prevalence of school-associated violent deaths since
June 2011. For example, the Sandy Hook Elementary
School shooting incident on December 14, 2012,
in Newtown, Connecticut resulted in 20 child and
6 adult deaths.2 Since the Sandy Hook incident,
preliminary counts from media reports indicate
that there were 17 school-associated violent deaths
between December 15, 2012, and November 14,
2013; of these deaths, 11 were homicides and 6 were
suicides. Six of the victims were identified as being
between the ages of 5 and 18.
SAVD defines a school-associated violent death as
“a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving
a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal injury
occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary
or secondary school in the United States.” Schoolassociated violent deaths include those that occurred
while the victim was on the way to or returning from
regular sessions at school or while the victim was
attending or traveling to or from an official schoolsponsored event. Victims of school-associated violent
deaths include not only students and staff members,
but also others who are not students or staff members,
such as parents. Between July 1, 2010 and June 30,
2011, there were 31 school-associated violent deaths
in elementary and secondary schools in the United
States (figure 1.1 and table 1.1).
Of the 31 student, staff, and nonstudent schoolassociated violent deaths occurring between July 1,
2010, and June 30, 2011, there were 25 homicides

and 6 suicides. Data for school-associated violent
deaths for the 2010–11 school year are preliminary
until interviews with law enforcement personnel have
been completed.
Data on homicides and suicides occurring at school
and away from school were drawn from a number of
sources. Data on violent deaths occurring away from
school were included in order to compare them to data
on violent deaths occurring at school. The most recent
data available for total suicides of school-age youth
(ages 5–18) are for the 2010 calendar year; the most
recent data available for total homicides of youth are
for the 2010–11 school year.3 During the 2010–11
school year, there were 1,336 homicides of youth
(figure 1.2 and table 1.1). During the 2010 calendar
year, there were 1,456 suicides of youth. During the
2010–11 school year, there were 11 homicides and
3 suicides of school-age youth at school (figure 1.1
and table 1.1), and, when instances of homicide and
suicide of school-age youth at school were combined,
there was approximately 1 homicide or suicide for
each 3.5 million students enrolled.4
The percentage of youth homicides occurring at
school remained at less than 2 percent of the total
number of youth homicides over all available survey
years, even though the absolute number of homicides
of school-age youth at school varied to some degree
across the years (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). Between
the 1992–93 and 2010–11 school years, from 1 to 10
school-age youth committed suicide at school each
year, with no consistent pattern of increase or decrease
in the number of suicides. The percentage of youth
suicides occurring at school remained at less than 1
percent of the total number of youth suicides over all
available survey years.

Data on total suicides are available only by calendar year,
whereas data on suicides and homicides at school and data
on total homicides are available by school year. Due to these
differences in reference periods, please use caution when
comparing violent deaths at school to total violent deaths.

The total number of students enrolled in prekindergarten
through 12th grade during the 2010–11 school year was
49,484,181 (Snyder and Dillow 2012).

This indicator has been updated to include 2010–11 data for total homicides. For more information: Tables 1.1 and 1.2, and
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2008), (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5702a1.htm).

A school-associated violent death is defined as “a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal
injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States,” while the victim was on the way to or from
regular sessions at school, or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims include students, staff
members, and others who are not students, from July 1, 1992 through June 30, 2011.
NOTE: “At school” includes on school property, on the way to or from regular sessions at school, and while attending or traveling to or from a schoolsponsored event. Estimates were revised and may differ from previously published data.

Indicator 2
Incidence of Victimization at School and Away From School
Following nearly two decades of steady decline, the total nonfatal victimization rate at school was higher in
2012 than in 2010 for students ages 12–18 (52 vs. 35 victimizations per 1,000 students). The victimization
rate away from school was also higher in 2012 than in 2010 (38 vs. 27 victimizations per 1,000 students).
Theft and violence both at school and while going
to and from school can affect the overall health and
well-being of adolescents, interfere with educational
goals, and stall normal healthy development
(Fredland 2008). This type of victimization can also
lead to higher-than-average rates of teacher turnover,
increases in student dropout rates, students changing
schools, principals and teachers retiring early,
increases in student fear of violence at school, and a
decline in learning (Crews, Crews, and Turner 2008).
In 2012, data from the National Crime Victimization
Survey 5 showed that more victimizations were
committed against students ages 12–18 at school than
away from school.6 Students ages 12–18 experienced
about 1,364,900 nonfatal victimizations (theft7 and
violent crime8) at school,9 compared to about 991,200
nonfatal victimizations away from school (table 2.1).
These figures represent total crime victimization rates
of 52 victimizations per 1,000 students at school and
38 per 1,000 students away from school.
For most years between 1992 and 2008, the rates
of theft at school among students ages 12–18 were
higher than the rates of theft away from school, but
there were no measurable differences between these
rates in 2009, 2010, or 2011. In 2012, the rate of theft

“Students” refers to youth ages 12–18 whose educational
attainment did not exceed grade 12 at the time of the
survey. An uncertain percentage of these persons may not
have attended school during the survey reference period.
These data do not take into account the number of hours
that students spend at school or away from school.
7 
“Theft” includes attempted and completed pursesnatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted
and completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle
thefts. Theft does not include robbery, which involves the
threat or use of force and is classified as a violent crime.
8 
“Violent victimization” includes serious violent crimes
and simple assault.
9 
“At school” includes inside the school building, on
school property, or on the way to or from school.

at school (24 victimizations per 1,000 students) was
greater than the rate of theft away from school (18
per 1,000 students). Between 1992 and 2000, the
rates of violent victimization per 1,000 students at
school were either lower than the rates away from
school or not measurably different than the rates
away from school. Since 2001, the rates of violent
victimization per 1,000 students at school have
generally been higher than the rates away from school
or not measurably different than the rates away from
school. In 2012, the rate of violent victimization at
school (29 per 1,000 students) was greater than the
rate of violent victimization away from school (20 per
1,000 students). This difference was driven primarily
by a higher rate of simple assault at school that year.10
Rates of serious violent victimization11 against students
ages 12–18 at school were generally lower than those
occurring away from school in most survey years
between 1992 and 2008; between 2009 and 2012
there were no measurable differences in these rates.
Between 1992 and 2012, the total victimization rates
for students ages 12–18 generally declined both at
and away from school. The total victimization rate
against students ages 12–18 at school decreased from
181 victimizations per 1,000 students in 1992 to 52
victimizations per 1,000 students in 2012. Away
from school, the rate of total victimization declined
from 173 victimizations per 1,000 students to 38
victimizations per 1,000 (figure 2.1).
This pattern also held for thefts, violent victimizations,
and serious violent victimizations between 1992 and
2012. Thefts at school declined from a rate of 114
per 1,000 students to 24 per 1,000, and the rate of
Indicator 2 continued on page 11.

“Simple assault” is the difference between total violence
and serious violence. It includes threats and attacks without
a weapon or serious injury.

“Serious violent victimization” includes the crimes of
rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.

Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization

theft away from school decreased from 79 thefts
per 1,000 students to 18 per 1,000. The rate of
violent victimization at school declined from
68 victimizations per 1,000 students in 1992
to 29 per 1,000 in 2012. Away from school, the
rate of violent victimization declined from 94
victimizations per 1,000 students to 20 per 1,000.
Serious violent victimizations at school declined
from 8 per 1,000 students in 1992 to 3 per 1,000
in 2012. Serious violent victimization rates away
from school declined from 43 victimizations per
1,000 students in 1992 to 7 per 1,000 in 2012.

In the most recent period between 2011 and 2012,
there were no measurable differences in the rates of
total, theft, violent, or serious violent victimizations
at or away from school. However, the total, theft,
and violent victimization rates at school increased
from 2010 to 2012. The rates of total and violent
victimization away from school increased from 2010
to 2012. Between 2010 and 2012, there were no
measurable differences between the rates of theft
away from school and serious violent victimization
at school or away from school.

NOTE: Due to methodological changes, use caution when comparing 2006 estimates to other years. “Serious violent victimization” includes the crimes
of rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. “All violent victimization” includes serious violent crimes as well as simple assault. “Theft” includes attempted and completed purse-snatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle
thefts. Theft does not include robbery, which involves the threat or use of force and is classified as a violent crime. “Total victimization” includes theft and

The victimization rates for students in 2012 varied
according to student characteristics. The total
victimization rate at school was greater for students
ages 12–14 (65 per 1,000 students) than for students
ages 15–18 (41 per 1,000 students; table 2.2). This
age difference was due primarily to the higher rate of
violent victimization at school for younger students
(42 per 1,000 students ages 12–14) compared to
older students (16 per 1,000 students ages 15–18).
No measurable differences were found by age group
in the rates of theft victimization at school. There
were no measurable differences between age groups
in the rates of total victimization, theft, and violent
victimization away from school in 2012 (figure 2.2).
The rates of total victimization at and away from
school were greater for males than for females in
2012. Males experienced 60 nonfatal victimizations

per 1,000 students at school, compared to 45
victimizations per 1,000 females. Away from school,
males experienced 45 nonfatal victimizations
per 1,000 students, and females experienced 31
victimizations per 1,000 students (figure 2.3). The
apparent differences between male and female rates of
victimization for theft and violent crime at and away
from school in 2012 were not statistically different.
Students residing in urban or suburban areas had
higher rates of violent victimization at school
than those residing in rural areas in 2012. Violent
victimization rates at school were 38 per 1,000
students in urban areas and 28 per 1,000 students in
suburban areas, compared to 14 per 1,000 students
in rural areas. There were no measurable differences
in the violent victimization rates away from school
for students living in urban, suburban, or rural areas.

Prevalence of Victimization at School
In 2011, approximately 4 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being victimized at school during the
previous 6 months. Three percent of students reported theft, 1 percent reported violent victimization, and
one-tenth of 1 percent reported serious violent victimization in 2011. Between 1995 and 2011, the total
percentage of students ages 12–18 who reported being victimized at school, as well as the percentages of
students who reported theft, violent victimization, and serious violent victimization, decreased.
The School Crime Supplement12 collects data on
the percentage of students ages 12–18 who reported
criminal victimization at school13 during the previous
6 months. In addition to the total percentages reported
by students, victimization is also reported by type,
namely theft,14 violent victimization,15 and serious
violent victimization.16 Results from the most recent
data collection show that in 2011, approximately
4 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being
victimized at school during the previous 6 months.
Three percent of students reported theft, 1 percent
reported violent victimization, and one-tenth of 1
percent reported serious violent victimization (figure
3.1 and table 3.1).
In 2011, reports on the prevalence of victimization
varied by some school and student characteristics.
Differences were observed by school type in the
reporting of victimization in 2011. A higher
percentage of students attending public schools
reported being victimized at school compared with
students attending private schools (4 percent vs. 2
percent). The percentage of students reporting theft
was also higher at public schools (3 percent) than at
private schools (1 percent) in 2011.
There were some measurable differences in student
reports of victimization by grade in 2011. For example,

a higher percentage of 9th-graders than of 7th-, 10th-,
and12th-graders reported being victimized at school
during the previous 6 months (5 vs. 3 percent each).
Four percent each of 6th- and 8th-graders and 3
percent of 11th-graders also reported victimization.
A higher percentage of 9th-graders (4 percent) than
of 7th-, 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-graders (2 percent each)
reported theft. In addition, 3 percent each of 6th- and
11th-graders reported theft in 2011.
There were no measurable differences between
the percentages of White, Black, Hispanic, and
Asian students ages 12–18 who reported criminal
victimization, theft, and violent victimization at
school in 2011. About 5 percent of Black students,
4 percent of White students, and 3 percent each
of Hispanic and Asian students reported criminal
victimization at school. Four percent of Black
students, 3 percent of Asian students, and 2 percent
each of White and Hispanic students reported
theft. One percent each of White, Black, and
Hispanic students reported violent victimization
(the percentage of Asian students reporting violent
victimization rounded to zero).
Among students ages 12–18 in 2011, there were no
measurable differences detected by sex in reports of
victimization. Four percent of male students and 3
percent of female students reported being victimized
at school during the previous 6 months. Three percent
each of male and female students reported theft, and
1 percent each of male and female students reported
violent victimization in 2011 (figure 3.2 and table 3.1).
No measurable differences were observed by
urbanicity in the prevalence of victimization in 2011.
About 4 percent of students ages 12–18 from urban
areas and 3 percent each of students from suburban
and rural areas reported criminal victimization at
school.

decreased by more than half, from 10 percent in 1995
to 4 percent in 2011. Among female students, the
percentage who reported being victimized at school
also decreased by more than half, from 9 percent in
1995 to 3 percent in 2011. For students attending
both public and private schools, the percentages of
students who reported victimization decreased. Ten

Indicator 4
Threats and Injuries With Weapons on School Property
In 2011, about 7 percent of students in grades 9–12 were threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property. This percentage was not measurably different from the percentage who were threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property in 2009 (8 percent).
Every year, some students are threatened or injured
with a weapon while they are on school property.
The percentage of students victimized in this way
provides a measure of how safe our schools are, and of
whether levels of safety in schools have changed over
time. In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in
grades 9–12 were asked whether and how often they
had been threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property during the 12 months preceding the
survey. In 2011, about 7 percent of students reported
they were threatened or injured with a weapon, such
as a gun, knife, or club, on school property17 (table
4.1). This percentage was not measurably different
from the percentages of students who reported
being threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property in 2009 (8 percent), or in 1993 (7 percent),
the first year of data collection.
In each survey year, a higher percentage of males
than females reported being threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property (figure 4.1 and
table 4.1). In 2011, approximately 10 percent of males
and 5 percent of females reported being threatened
or injured with a weapon on school property. These
percentages were not measurably different from
the percentages of males and females who reported
being threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property in 2009 (10 percent of males and 5 percent
of females), or in 1993 (9 percent of males and 5
percent of females).
There were also differences in the percentages of
students who reported being threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property by race/ethnicity
and grade level. Specifically, the percentage of students
who reported being threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property in 2011 was smaller for

White students (6 percent) than for students of two
or more races (10 percent) and Hispanic and Black
students (9 percent each; figure 4.2 and table 4.1).
Generally, the percentage of students who reported
being threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property was higher for lower grade levels (table 4.1).
For example, in 2011, a smaller percentage of 12thgraders (6 percent) than of 9th- and 10th-graders (8
percent each) reported that they were threatened or
injured with a weapon on school property.
Students were asked how many times they had
been threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property during the previous 12 months. A greater
percentage of students experienced being threatened
or injured 1 time in the previous 12 months compared
with those who reported being threatened or injured 2
or 3 times, 4 to 11 times, and 12 or more times (figure
4.3 and table 4.1). In 2011, about 3 percent of students
were threatened or injured with a weapon 1 time, 2
percent were threatened or injured with a weapon 2
or 3 times, 1 percent were threatened or injured with
a weapon 4 to 11 times, and 1 percent were threatened
or injured with a weapon 12 or more times.
In 2011, the percentage of public school students who
reported being threatened or injured with a weapon
on school property varied among the 38 states and the
District of Columbia for which data were available.
Among these states, the percentage of students
who reported being threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property ranged from 5 percent
in Wisconsin to 12 percent in Georgia (table 4.2).

Indicator 5
Teachers Threatened With Injury or Physically Attacked by Students
During the 2011–12 school year, a higher percentage of public than private school teachers reported being
threatened with injury (10 vs. 3 percent) or being physically attacked (6 vs. 3 percent) by a student from
their school.
Students are not the only victims of intimidation or
violence in schools. Teachers are also subject to threats
and physical attacks, and students from their schools
sometimes commit these offenses. The Schools and
Staffing Survey (SASS) asks school teachers whether
they were threatened with injury or physically
attacked by a student from their school in the previous
12 months. During the 2011–12 school year, 9
percent of school teachers reported being threatened
with injury by a student from their school (table 5.1).
This percentage was lower than the 12 percent of
teachers who reported being threatened with injury
in 1993–94, but higher than the percentages of
teachers who reported being threatened with injury
in 2003–04 and 2007–08 (7 percent each) (figure
5.1). The percentage of teachers reporting that they
had been physically attacked by a student from their
school in 2011–12 (5 percent) was higher than in any
previous survey year (ranging from 3 to 4 percent).
During the 2011–12 school year, there were no
measurable differences in the percentages of male
and female teachers who reported being threatened
with injury during the school year (9 percent each);
however, there were gender differences in the reports
of being physically attacked (figure 5.2). Six percent
of female school teachers reported being physically
attacked by a student from their school, compared
with 4 percent of male teachers.
There were some differences in the percentages of
teachers who reported being threatened by a student
and being physically attacked by the race/ethnicity

of the teacher. In the 2011–12 school year, a higher
percentage of Black teachers (14 percent) than White
teachers and teachers of other racial/ethnic groups
(9 percent each) reported being threatened by a
student from their school during the school year.
A higher percentage of Black teachers (8 percent)
than Hispanic teachers (4 percent) reported being
physically attacked by a student.
The percentages of teachers who reported being
threatened with injury or being physically attacked
during the school year by a student from their school
varied by school characteristics during the 2011–12
school year (figure 5.3). The percentage of elementary
teachers who reported being physically attacked by a
student was higher than the percentage of secondary
teachers reporting it (8 vs. 3 percent). In addition,
a higher percentage of public than private school
teachers reported being threatened with injury (10
vs. 3 percent) or being physically attacked (6 vs. 3
percent) by a student during 2011–12.
Public school teachers’ reports of being threatened
with injury or physically attacked varied among
the states and the District of Columbia. During the
2011–12 school year, the percentage of public school
teachers who reported being threatened with injury
during the previous 12 months ranged from 5 percent
in Oregon to 18 percent in Louisiana (table 5.2). The
percentage who reported being physically attacked
ranged from 3 percent in Alabama, Mississippi,
North Dakota, Oregon, and Tennessee to 11 percent
in Wisconsin.

This indicator has been updated to include 2011–12 data. For more information: Tables 5.1 and 5.2, and appendix B for
definitions of instructional levels.

Indicator 6
Violent and Other Crime Incidents at Public Schools, and Those
Reported to the Police
In 2009–10, about 74 percent of public schools recorded one or more violent incidents, 16 percent
recorded one or more serious violent incidents, and 44 percent recorded one or more thefts.
In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public
school principals were asked to provide the number
of violent incidents,18 serious violent incidents,19 thefts
of items valued at $10 or greater without personal
confrontation, and other incidents20 that occurred at
their school.21 Public school principals were also asked
to provide the number of incidents they reported to
the police. This indicator presents the percentage of
public schools that recorded one or more of these
specified crimes, the total number of these crimes
recorded, and the rate of crimes per 1,000 students.
These data are also presented for crimes that were
reported to the police.
In all survey years the percentage of public schools
that recorded incidents of crime was between 85
and 86 percent, with the exception of school year
2003–04. In 2003–04, the percentage of public
schools that recorded incidents of crime was 89
percent. Similarly, the percentage of public schools
that reported incidents of crime to the police was
between 60 and 62 percent in all survey years with
the exception of 2003–04, when 65 percent of public
schools reported one or more incidents to the police.
For the majority of types of crime, the percentages
of public schools recording incidents of crime or
18

 “Violent incidents” include rape, sexual battery other
than rape, physical attack or fight with or without a weapon,
threat of physical attack with or without a weapon, and
robbery with or without a weapon.
19
 “Serious violent incidents” include rape, sexual battery
other than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon,
threat of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or
without a weapon.
20
 “Other incidents” include possession of a firearm or
explosive device; possession of a knife or sharp object;
distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol;
vandalism; and inappropriate distribution, possession, or use
of prescription drugs.
21
 “At school” was defined for respondents to include
activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds,
on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored
events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include
incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school
hours, or when school activities or events were in session.

reporting incidents of crime to the police in 2009–10
were not measurably different from the percentages of
schools doing so in 2007–08. However, the percentage
of schools that recorded vandalism decreased from 49
percent in 2007–08 to 46 percent in 2009–10.
During the 2009–10 school year, 85 percent of public
schools recorded that one or more of these incidents
of violence, theft, or other crimes had taken place,
amounting to an estimated 1.9 million crimes (figure
6.1 and table 6.1). This figure translates to a rate of
approximately 40 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled
in 2009–10. During the same year, 60 percent of
schools reported one of the specified crimes to the
police, amounting to about 689,000 crimes—or 15
crimes per 1,000 students enrolled.
In 2009–10, a greater percentage of schools recorded
an incident of crime than reported an incident of
crime to the police. This pattern held true for violent
crimes, serious violent crimes, thefts, and other
crimes. Seventy-four percent of schools recorded one
or more violent incidents of crime (a rate of 25 crimes
per 1,000 students enrolled), 16 percent recorded one
or more serious violent incidents (a rate of 1 crime
per 1,000 students enrolled), 44 percent recorded one
or more thefts (a rate of 5 crimes per 1,000 students
enrolled), and 68 percent recorded one or more
other incidents (a rate of 9 crimes per 1,000 students
enrolled). In comparison, 40 percent of public schools
reported at least one violent incident to police (a rate
of 6 reported crimes per 1,000 students), 10 percent
reported at least one serious violent incident to
police (a rate of less than 1 percent reported crimes

“Other incidents” include possession of a firearm or explosive device; possession of a knife or sharp object; distribution, possession, or use of
illegal drugs or alcohol; vandalism; and inappropriate distribution, possession, or use of prescription drugs.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At school” was
defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold schoolsponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school hours or when
school activities or events were in session.

The percentage of schools that recorded incidents
of violent crime, serious violent crime, theft, and
other incidents varied by school characteristics. For
example, by school level, primary schools recorded
lower percentages of these types of crimes than
middle schools and high schools: 64 percent of
primary schools recorded violent incidents of crime
compared with 91 percent each of middle schools
and high schools (figure 6.2 and table 6.2). A lower
percentage of primary schools recorded serious violent
incidents of crime (13 percent) than middle or high
schools (19 and 28 percent, respectively), a lower
percentage of primary schools recorded incidents of
theft (26 percent) than middle or high schools (65 and
83 percent, respectively), and a lower percentage of
primary schools recorded other incidents (57 percent)
than middle or high schools (82 and 92 percent,
respectively).
A similar pattern was observed for public schools
that reported such incidents of violent crime, serious
violent crime, theft, and other incidents to the police.
The percentages of primary schools that reported
incidents of these types of crime to the police were
lower than for middle schools and high schools (figure
6.2 and table 6.3).

School Environment

Data on the number of crimes recorded and reported
by schools in 2009–10 were categorized by frequency
range as well. For example, 26 percent of schools
recorded zero violent crimes, and 19 percent of schools
recorded 20 or more violent crimes (figure 6.3 and
table 6.4). Sixty percent of schools did not report a
violent crime to the police, while 5 percent of schools
reported 20 or more violent crimes to the police. With
regard to serious violent crimes, 84 percent of schools
did not record a serious violent crime, and 2 percent
of schools recorded 10 or more such crimes. Ninety
percent of schools did not report a serious violent
crime to the police, and 1 percent of schools reported
10 or more serious violent crimes to the police (table
6.5). The number of crimes recorded by schools by
frequency range varied by school characteristics. A
larger percentage of city schools recorded 20 or more
violent incidents in 2009–10 than suburban schools
or rural schools (table 6.4). In 2009–10, this amounts
to about 25 percent of city schools recording 20 or
more violent incidents, compared with 19 percent
of suburban schools and 14 percent of rural schools.

Indicator 7
Discipline Problems Reported by Public Schools
During the 2009–10 school year, 23 percent of public schools reported that bullying occurred among
students on a daily or weekly basis, 9 percent reported student acts of disrespect for teachers other than
verbal abuse on a daily or weekly basis, and 5 percent reported that student verbal abuse of teachers
occurred on a daily or weekly basis. Sixteen percent reported gang activities during the school year.
In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school
principals were asked how often certain disciplinary
problems happened in their schools.22 This indicator
examines the daily or weekly occurrence of student
racial/ethnic tensions, bullying, sexual harassment of
other students, sexual harassment of other students
based on sexual orientation or gender identity, verbal
abuse of teachers, acts of disrespect for teachers other
than verbal abuse, and widespread disorder in the
classroom. It also looks at occurrences of gang and
cult or extremist group activities during the school
year. In the 2009–10 survey administration, schools
were also asked to report selected types of cyberbullying problems at school or away from school that
occurred daily or weekly.
During the 2009–10 school year, 23 percent of
public schools reported that bullying occurred
among students on a daily or weekly basis, and 9
percent reported student acts of disrespect for teachers
other than verbal abuse on a daily or weekly basis
(table 7.1). With regard to other discipline problems
reported as occurring at least once a week, 5 percent
of schools reported student verbal abuse of teachers,

and 3 percent each of reported student racial/ethnic
tensions, student sexual harassment of other students,
sexual harassment of other students based on sexual
orientation or gender identity, and widespread
disorder in classrooms. Sixteen percent of public
schools reported that gang activities had happened
at all during the 2009–10 school year and 2 percent
reported that cult or extremist activities had happened
at all during this period.
Discipline problems reported by public schools
varied by school characteristics. In 2009–10, a higher
percentage of city schools than rural schools and
suburban schools reported various types of discipline
problems (figure 7.1 and table 7.1). For example, 27
percent of city schools, compared with 21 percent of
rural schools and 20 percent of suburban schools,
reported that student bullying occurred at least once a
week. A greater percentage of city schools (28 percent)
than suburban schools and rural schools (15 and 9
percent, respectively) reported any occurrence of gang
activities during the school year.
Indicator 7 continued on page 36.

“At school” was defined for respondents to include
activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds,
on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored
events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include
incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school
hours or when school activities or events were in session.

In 2009–10, the percentage of middle schools
reporting student racial and ethnic tension (5 percent)
was higher than the percentage of high schools (3
percent) and primary schools (2 percent) that reported
student racial and ethnic tension (table 7.1). Schools
with an enrollment size of 1,000 or more reported
higher percentages of student racial and ethnic
tension (6 percent) than schools with an enrollment
size of 500–999 or 300–499 (3 percent each).
In addition, 10 percent of schools where 76 percent or
more of the students were eligible for free or reducedprice lunch reported the daily or weekly occurrence
of student verbal abuse of teachers, compared to 1
percent of schools where 25 percent or less of the
students were eligible.23
The percentages of public schools that reported the
occurrence of student bullying, student verbal abuse
of teachers, and student acts of disrespect for teachers
other than verbal abuse were greater in 1999–2000
than in 2009–10. For example, in 1999–2000,
approximately 29 percent of public schools reported
student bullying, compared with 23 percent of public
schools that reported student bullying in 2009–10.
Eleven percent of schools reported that student acts
of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse
occurred at least once a week in 2007–08, higher than
the 9 percent in 2009–10 (table 7.1). The percentage
of public schools that reported widespread disorder
in the classrooms decreased from 4 percent in

2007–08 to 3 percent in 2009–10. The percentages
of public schools that reported gang activity at all at
their schools during the school year decreased from
20 percent in 2007–08 to 16 percent in 2009–10
(table 7.1).
In 2009–10 the School Survey on Crime and Safety
included a questionnaire item on cyber-bullying
in which public schools were asked to report the
occurrence of cyber-bullying among students at
school and away from school.24 Eight percent of
public schools reported that cyber-bullying had
occurred among students daily or at least once a
week at school or away from school. Four percent
each of public schools also reported that the school
environment was affected by cyber-bullying and that
staff resources were used to deal with cyber-bullying
(table 7.2).
Public schools’ reports on the occurrence of cyberbullying at school and away from school in 2009–10
varied by school characteristics (table 7.2). Primary
schools reported lower percentages of cyber-bullying
among students (2 percent) than middle schools (19
percent), high schools (18 percent), and combined
schools (13 percent). Thirteen percent of schools with
less than 5 percent combined enrollment of Black,
Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/
Alaska Native students reported cyber-bullying
among students, compared with 5 percent of schools
with 50 percent or more combined enrollment.

Indicator 8
Students’ Reports of Gangs at School
The percentage of students who reported that gangs were present at their school decreased from 20 percent
in 2009 to 18 percent in 2011. A higher percentage of students from urban schools (23 percent) reported
a gang presence than students from suburban (16 percent) and rural schools (12 percent) in 2011. The
percentage of students from urban schools who reported a gang presence decreased from 31 percent in 2009
to 23 percent in 2011.
Gang activity in the vicinity of schools poses a risk
to staff and student safety and to school security.
Intimidation of staff and students by gang members
has a large impact on the educational environment
and perception of school safety (Smith et al. 2011).
The School Crime Supplement to the National Crime
Victimization Survey asked students ages 12–18 if
gangs were present at their school during the school
year.25
In 2011, about 18 percent of students ages 12–18
reported that gangs were present at their school
during the school year. This was a decrease from the
20 percent of students who reported a gang presence
in 2009. In 2011, a higher percentage of students from
urban areas (23 percent) reported a gang presence at
their school than students from suburban and rural
areas (16 percent and 12 percent, respectively; figure
8.1 and table 8.1). While the percentages of students
from suburban areas and rural areas who reported
a gang presence at their school did not measurably
change between 2009 and 2011, the percentage
of students from urban areas who reported a gang
presence at their school decreased from 31 percent
in 2009 to 23 percent in 2011.
There were no measurable differences in the
percentages of male and female students who reported
a gang presence at their school (18 and 17 percent,
respectively) in 2011. The percentage of female
students who reported a gang presence did not
measurably change between 2009 and 2011; however,
the percentage of male students who reported a gang
presence decreased from 21 percent in 2009 to 18
percent in 2011 (table 8.1).

Approximately 19 percent of students attending
public schools reported that gangs were present at
their school, compared with 2 percent of students
attending private schools in 2011. The percentage of
private school students who reported a gang presence
at their school was not measurably different between
the two most recent survey years 2009 and 2011 (2
percent in each year). In contrast, the percentage of
public school students who reported a gang presence
decreased from 22 percent in 2009 to 19 percent in
2011.
In 2011, a higher percentage of Black students (33
percent) than of Hispanic students (26 percent)
reported the presence of gangs at their school. Also,
higher percentages of Black students and Hispanic
students than of White students (11 percent) and
Asian students (10 percent) reported the presence
of gangs at their schools. The percentage of White
students who reported a gang presence decreased from
14 percent in 2009 to 11 percent in 2011. Similarly,
the percentage of Hispanic students who reported a
gang presence decreased from 33 percent in 2009 to
26 percent in 2011. However, the percentages of Black
and Asian students who reported a gang presence were
not measurably different between 2009 and 2011
(figure 8.2 and table 8.1).
The percentages of students in 6th through 8th
grade who reported a gang presence at their school
were lower than the percentages for students in 9th
through 12th grade in 2011. Between 8 and 11
percent of 6th-, 7th-, and 8th-graders reported the
presence of gangs, compared with 21 percent of 12thgraders, 22 percent of 9th-graders, and 23 percent
each of 10th- and 11th-graders (table 8.1).

Indicator 9
Students’ Reports of Illegal Drug Availability on School Property
In 2011, about 26 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported that illegal drugs were offered, sold, or given
to them on school property. This percentage represents a decrease from 1995, when 32 percent of students
reported that illegal drugs were offered, sold, or given to them.
In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades
9–12 were asked whether someone had offered, sold,
or given them an illegal drug on school property in the
12 months preceding the survey.26 The percentage of
students in grades 9–12 who reported that drugs were
made available to them on school property increased
from 1993 to 1995 (from 24 to 32 percent), but then
decreased to 26 percent in 2011 (table 9.1). There was
no measurable difference in the percentages reported
in 1993 and 2011. However, the percentage of
students who reported that drugs were made available
to them on school property in 2011 (26 percent) was
higher than the percentage of students who reported
that drugs were made available to them on school
property in 2009 (23 percent; figure 9.1 and table 9.1).
Student reports regarding the availability of
illegal drugs on school property varied by student
characteristics. For example, in each survey year
from 1993 to 2011, a higher percentage of males than
females reported that drugs were made available to
them on school property (figure 9.1 and table 9.1).
Specifically, in 2011, some 29 percent of males and 22
percent of females reported that drugs were offered,
sold, or given to them on school property. For both
males and females, the percentages reported in 2011
were not measurably different from the percentages
reported in 2009 (26 percent of males and 19 percent
of females).

In 2011, a higher percentage of 10th-graders reported
that illegal drugs were made available to them on
school property than 9th-graders or 12th-graders;
however, there were no other measurable differences
across grades in the percentages of students reporting
that illegal drugs were made available to them in 2011
(table 9.1). Twenty-four percent of 9th-graders and
12th-graders, as well as 27 percent of 11th-graders,
and 28 percent of 10th-graders reported that drugs
were made available to them that year.
The percentage of students who reported having
illegal drugs offered, sold, or given to them on
school property differed across racial/ethnic groups
(figure 9.2 and table 9.1). In 2011, higher percentages
of American Indian/Alaska Native students (40
percent), Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students
(39 percent), and Hispanic students and students of
two or more races (33 percent each), than White,
Black, or Asian students (23 percent each) reported
that illegal drugs were offered, sold, or given to them
on school property.
In 2011, public school student reports of the
availability of illegal drugs on school property varied
across the 43 states and jurisdictions for which data
were available. Among these states, the percentage
of students reporting that drugs were offered, sold,
or given to them on school property ranged from 12
percent in Iowa to 35 percent in Arizona and New
Mexico (table 9.2).

Students’ Reports of Being Called Hate-Related Words and Seeing
Hate-Related Graffiti
In 2011, about 9 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being the target of hate-related words at school
during the school year and 28 percent of students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school.
The School Crime Supplement to the National Crime
Victimization Survey collects data on students’
reports of being the target of hate-related27 words and
seeing hate-related graffiti at school.28 Specifically,
in 2011, students ages 12–18 were asked whether
someone at school had called them a derogatory
word having to do with their race, ethnicity, religion,
disability, gender, or sexual orientation. Students also
were asked if they had seen hate-related graffiti at
their school—that is, hate-related words or symbols
written in classrooms, bathrooms, or hallways or on
the outside of the school building.
In 2011, about 9 percent of students ages 12–18
reported being the target of hate-related words at
school during the school year (figure 10.1 and table
10.1). The percentage of students who reported being
the target of hate-related words decreased from 12
percent in 2001 to 9 percent in 2011; however, there
was no measurable difference between the percentages
in the two most recent survey years 2009 and 2011
(9 percent in both years).
Twenty-eight percent of students reported seeing
hate-related graffiti at school during the school year
in 2011. The percentage of students who reported
seeing hate-related graffiti at school decreased from
36 percent in 1999 to 28 percent in 2011, but there
was no measurable difference between the percentages
in the two most recent survey years 2009 and 2011
(29 and 28 percent, respectively).
As was the case in all survey years since 2001, no
measurable differences were observed in 2011 in the
percentages of males and females who reported being
called a hate-related word or who reported seeing

hate-related graffiti at school during the school year.
The percentage of male students who reported being
called a hate-related word did not measurably change
between 2009 and 2011; however, the percentage of
male students who reported being called a hate-related
word was lower in 2011 (9 percent) than in 2001
(13 percent). In addition, the percentage of female
students who reported being called a hate-related
word did not measurably change between 2009 and
2011, but it was lower in 2011 (9 percent) than in
2001 (12 percent).
Similarly, the percentage of male students who
reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school did
not measurably change between 2009 and 2011, but
it was lower in 2011 (29 percent) than in 1999 (34
percent). Also, the percentage of female students who
reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school did not
measurably change between 2009 and 2011, but it
was also lower in 2011 (28 percent) than in 1999
(39 percent).
In 2011, there were no measurable differences in the
percentages of students who reported being called
hate-related words or who reported seeing hate-related
graffiti at school by race/ethnicity (figure 10.1 and
table 10.1). Eight percent of White students, 9 percent
of Asian students, 10 percent of Hispanic students,
and 11 percent of Black students reported being called
a hate-related word. Twenty-eight percent each of
Black and White students, 29 percent of Hispanic
students and, 30 percent of Asian students reported
seeing hate-related graffiti at school.

Some measurable differences were observed across
grades in students’ reports of seeing hate-related
graffiti at school in 2011. For example, a lower
percentage of 6th-, 7th-, 8th-, and 12th-graders (26
percent each) reported seeing hate-related graffiti in
2011, compared with 32 percent of 11th-graders and
33 percent of 10th-graders (table 10.1). There were
no measurable differences observed across grades in
students’ reports of being called a hate-related word
at school.
By school sector, the percentage of public school
students who reported being called a hate-related
word (9 percent) was not measurably different from
the percentage of private school students (7 percent)
in 2011. In each data collection year between 1999
and 2011, a higher percentage of public school
students than private school students reported
seeing hate-related graffiti at school. For instance,
in 2011, approximately 30 percent of public school
students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school
compared with 13 percent of private school students.
Students who reported being the target of hate-related
words at school in 2011 were asked to indicate whether

the derogatory word they were called was related to
their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender,
or sexual orientation (figure 10.2 and table 10.2).
A higher percentage of male students than female
students reported being called a hate-related word
with regard to their race (5 percent vs. 4 percent). In
turn, a higher percentage of female students than male
students reported being called a hate-related word
with regard to their gender (2 percent vs. 1 percent).
With respect to being called a hate-related word
related to their race, White students reported being
the target at a lower percentage than their peers.
Specifically, 2 percent of White students reported
being called a hate-related word with regard to their
race, compared with 7 percent each of Black, Asian,
and Hispanic students, and 8 percent of students of
other races. In addition, among students who reported
being called a hate-related word with regard to their
ethnicity, a higher percentage of Hispanic students (7
percent) reported being the target than their White,
Black, or Other race/ethnicity peers (between 1 and
4 percent of students).

In the School Crime Supplement (SCS) questionnaire, students were asked if they had been the target of hate-related words at school. Students
who indicated that they had been called a hate-related word were asked to choose the specific characteristics that the hate-related word targeted.
Students were allowed to choose more than one characteristic. If a student chose more than one characteristic, he or she is counted once under
the “total” category. Therefore, the total percentage of students who reported being called a hate-related word is less than the sum of the students’
individual characteristics.

Indicator 11
Bullying at School and Cyber-Bullying Anywhere
In 2011, about 28 percent of 12- to 18-year-old students reported being bullied at school, and 9 percent
reported being cyber-bullied during the school year.
Bullying29 is now recognized as a widespread and
often neglected problem in schools that has serious
implications for victims of bullying and for those
who perpetrate the bullying (Swearer et al. 2010).
The School Crime Supplement to the National Crime
Victimization Survey collects data on students ages
12–18 and their reports of being bullied at school30
and being cyber-bullied anywhere during the school
year. Cyber-bullying31 is distinct from bullying at
school. Survey items on cyber-bullying anywhere are
asked separately from other survey items on bullying
at school; however, the context for cyber-bullying may
have developed at school.
This indicator first discusses student reports of being
bullied at school in 2011 by selected bullying problems
and selected student and school characteristics. It
then discusses student reports of being cyber-bullied
anywhere in 2011 by selected cyber-bullying problems
and selected student and school characteristics. In
addition, findings on bullying at school over time are
presented for 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011. Prior data
are excluded from the time series due to significant
redesign of the bullying items in 2005.
In 2011, about 28 percent of students ages 12–18
reported being bullied at school during the school
year (figure 11.1 and table 11.1). Of those students
who reported being bullied at school, 18 percent
reported that they were made fun of, called names,
or insulted. Eighteen percent of students reported

being the subject of rumors, 5 percent reported being
threatened with harm, and 3 percent reported that
others tried to make them do things they did not want
to do. Six percent of students reported being excluded
from activities on purpose, 3 percent reported that
their property was destroyed by others on purpose,
and 8 percent said they were pushed, shoved, tripped,
or spit on. In 2011, about 21 percent of students who
were pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on at school
during the school year reported being injured as a
result of the incident.
Students’ reports of being bullied at school varied by
student and school characteristics. In 2011, a higher
percentage of females than of males ages 12–18
reported that they were made fun of, called names, or
insulted (19 vs. 16 percent), were the subject of rumors
(24 vs. 13 percent), and were excluded from activities
on purpose (6 vs. 5 percent). The percentage of males
(9 percent) who reported being pushed, shoved,
tripped, or spit on was higher than the percentage of
females (7 percent) who reported being subjected to
the same type of bullying.

Indicator 11 continued on page 48.

29

  “Bullying” includes students who responded that another
student had made fun of them, called them names, or
insulted them; spread rumors about them; threatened them
with harm; tried to make them do something they did
not want to do; excluded them from activities on purpose;
destroyed their property on purpose; or pushed, shoved,
tripped, or spit on them.
30
 “At school” includes the school building, on school
property, on a school bus, or going to and from school.
31
  “Cyber-bullying” includes students who responded that
another student had posted hurtful information about them
on the Internet; purposefully shared private information
about them on the Internet; harassed them via instant
messaging; harassed them via Short Message Service (SMS)
text messaging; harassed them via e-mail; harassed them
while gaming; or excluded them online.

Overall, the percentage of students who reported
being bullied at school was highest for White students
and lowest for Asian students in 2011. Specifically, 15
percent of Asian students ages 12–18 reported being
bullied at school during the school year, compared
with 31 percent of White students, 27 percent of Black
students, and 22 percent of Hispanic students. Nine
percent of Asian students reported being made fun of,
called names, or insulted, compared with 21 percent
of White students and 16 percent of Black students.
Similarly, 8 percent of Asian students reported that
they had been the subject of rumors, compared with
20 percent of White students, 19 percent of Black
students, and 15 percent of Hispanic students.
A higher percentage of students in 6th grade than
of students in grades 7 through 12 reported being
bullied at school during the school year. In 2011,
about 37 percent of 6th-graders reported being bullied
at school, compared with 30 percent of 7th-graders,
31 percent of 8th-graders, 26 percent of 9th-graders,
28 percent of 10th-graders, 24 percent of 11thgraders, and 22 percent of 12th-graders.
By school sector, a higher percentage of public school
students than of private school students reported
being bullied and being subjects of selected bullying
problems at school in 2011. Twenty-eight percent
of public school students reported being bullied at
school, compared with 21 percent of private school
students. Higher percentages of public school students
than of private school students also reported that

48

School Environment

they were made fun of, called names, or insulted (18
vs. 14 percent), were the subject of rumors (19 vs. 13
percent), were threatened with harm (5 vs. 2 percent),
and were pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on (8 vs.
5 percent). Additionally, there were differences by
urbanicity: a lower percentage of students in urban
areas (25 percent) reported being bullied at school
than students in suburban and rural areas in 2011
(29 and 30 percent, respectively).
The School Crime Supplement asked students
ages 12–18 who reported being bullied at school
to indicate the location at which they had been
victimized. In 2011, of students who reported being
bullied, about 46 percent of students reported that the
bullying occurred in the hallway or stairwell at school
during the school year (figure 11.2 and table 11.2).
In addition, 33 percent reported being bullied inside
the classroom, and 22 percent reported being bullied
outside on school grounds. Eleven percent reported
being bullied in the bathroom or locker room, 9
percent reported being bullied in the cafeteria, 7
percent reported being bullied on the school bus, and
2 percent reported being bullied somewhere else in
school. For the most part, the percentages of students
who reported being bullied in various locations did
not differ by student or school characteristics.

In 2011, approximately 9 percent of students ages 12–
18 reported being cyber-bullied anywhere during the
school year (figure 11.3 and table 11.3). Four percent
of students reported that another student had posted
hurtful information on the Internet and 4 percent
reported being subject to harassing text messages.
Three percent of students reported being subject
to harassing instant messages, 2 percent reported
being subject to harassing e-mails, and 1 percent
each reported having their private information
purposefully shared on the Internet, being harassed
while gaming, and being excluded online.
With the exception of being the subject of harassment
while gaming and being excluded online, female
students ages 12–18 reported being the victims of
all other types of cyber-bullying problems at higher
percentages than males in 2011. For example, 6
percent of females versus 2 percent of males reported
that another student posted hurtful information
about them on the Internet, and the same percentages
of females and males, respectively, reported being
the subject of harassing text messages. However, 3
percent of male students reported being harassed
while gaming, compared with less than one-half of
1 percent of female students.
There were also some differences in the prevalence of
students reporting cyber-bullying anywhere during
the school year by students’ race/ethnicity, grade
level, and urbanicity. The percentage of students who
reported being cyber-bullied was higher for White
students (11 percent) than for Hispanic (8 percent)
or Black (7 percent) students. A higher percentage of
students in 10th grade (12 percent) reported being
cyber-bullied than of students in 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th,
and 12th grade (between 6 and 9 percent each). Also,
the percentage of students in urban areas reporting
cyber-bullying overall was lower than students in
suburban areas (7 and 10 percent, respectively).
In 2011, about 36 percent of students who reported
bullying problems at school indicated that they
occurred at least once or twice a month32 during the
school year (figure 11.4 and table 11.4). Among those

32

  Students who reported being bullied or cyber-bullied at
least once or twice a month includes students who reported
that they had been bullied (or cyber-bullied) “almost every
day,” “once or twice a week,” and “once or twice a month.”

50

School Environment

students who reported being bullied, there were no
measurable differences between males and females
in the frequency of their being bullied. Twenty-eight
percent of students who reported cyber-bullying
problems anywhere indicated that these problems
occurred at least once or twice a month during the
school year. In general, for students who reported
being cyber-bullied, greater percentages of males than
of females reported frequencies of cyber-bullying of
once or twice a month or more often. For example,
26 percent of males and 16 percent of females were
cyber-bullied once or twice a month, and 9 percent
of males and 3 percent of females were cyber-bullied
once or twice a week. On the other hand, a greater
percentage of females (79 percent) than of males (60
percent) reported being cyber-bullied once or twice
in the school year.
Students who reported being bullied also were asked
if they had notified an adult. In 2011, a higher
percentage of students reported notifying an adult
after being bullied at school than after being cyberbullied anywhere (40 vs. 26 percent). While there
was no measurable difference by sex in the percentage
of students notifying an adult after being bullied at
school, a higher percentage of females (32 percent)
than of males (16 percent) reported notifying an
adult after being cyber-bullied. Higher percentages of
students in grades 6 through 9 reported notifying an
adult after being bullied at school than did students
in grades 10 through 12; generally, higher percentages
of 6th- through 9th-graders than of 11th- and 12thgraders notified an adult about cyber-bullying.

Students’ reports of being bullied at school varied
over time (figure 11.5 and table 11.5). While no linear
trend was observed between 2005 and 2011, a higher
percentage of students reported being bullied in 2007
(32 percent) than in 2005, 2009, and 2011 (28 percent
in each year). For many of the school characteristics
examined, the percentages of students who reported
being bullied at school in 2011 were lower than in
2007. For example, in 2011 the percentage of public

Indicator 12
Teachers’ Reports on School Conditions
In 2011–12, higher percentages of public school teachers than of private school teachers reported that student
misbehavior and student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching.
Managing inappropriate behaviors and classroom
disruptions is time-consuming and takes away from
valuable instructional time and student engagement
in academic behaviors (Riley, McKevitt, Shriver,
and Allen 2011). In the Schools and Staffing Survey
(SASS), public and private school teachers were
asked whether student misbehavior and student
tardiness and class cutting interfered with their
teaching. During the 2011–12 school year, 38 percent
of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that student
misbehavior interfered with their teaching, and 35
percent reported that student tardiness and class
cutting interfered with their teaching (figure 12.1
and table 12.1). Teachers were also asked whether
school rules were enforced by other teachers at their
school, even for students not in their classes, and
whether school rules were enforced by the principal.
In 2011–12, about 69 percent of teachers agreed or
strongly agreed that other teachers at their school
enforced the school rules, and 84 percent reported
that the principal enforced the school rules (figure
12.1 and table 12.2).
The percentages of teachers who reported that
student misbehavior and student tardiness and
class cutting interfered with their teaching varied
by school characteristics during the 2011–12 school
year (table 12.1). For example, a higher percentage
of public school teachers (41 percent) than of private
school teachers (22 percent) reported that student
misbehavior interfered with their teaching. Thirtyeight percent of public school teachers reported that
student tardiness and class cutting interfered with
their teaching, compared with 19 percent of private
school teachers.
In every survey year, a lower percentage of elementary
school teachers than of secondary school teachers
reported that student tardiness and class cutting

interfered with their teaching; in 2011–12, 31
percent of elementary school teachers and 45
percent of secondary school teachers reported that
student tardiness and class cutting interfered with
their teaching (table 12.1). There was no measurable
difference between the percentages of elementary and
secondary school teachers who reported that student
misbehavior interfered with their teaching.
The percentage of teachers who reported that student
misbehavior interfered with their teaching fluctuated
between 1993–94 and 2011–12; however, the
percentage was higher in 2011–12 (38 percent) than
in the previous survey year (34 percent in 2007–08)
(figure 12.2). The percentage of teachers reporting
that student tardiness and class cutting interfered
with their teaching increased between 1993–94 and
2011–12 (from 25 to 35 percent). A higher percentage
of teachers reported that student tardiness and class
cutting interfered with their teaching in 2011–12
than in 2007–08 (35 vs. 31 percent).
In every survey year, a lower percentage of public
school teachers than of private school teachers agreed
that school rules were enforced by other teachers
and by the principal in their school (table 12.2). In
2011–12, some 68 percent of public school teachers
reported that school rules were enforced by other
teachers, compared with 77 percent of private school
teachers. In addition, 84 percent of public school
teachers reported that school rules were enforced by
the principal, compared with 89 percent of private
school teachers.

Between 1993–94 and 2011–12, the percentage of
teachers who agreed or strongly agreed that school
rules were enforced by other teachers fluctuated
between 64 and 73 percent, and the percentage who
agreed that rules were enforced by the principal
fluctuated between 82 and 89 percent, showing no
consistent trends. However, a lower percentage of
teachers reported that school rules were enforced
by other teachers in 2011–12 (69 percent) than in
the previous survey year (72 percent in 2007–08).
Similarly, the percentage of teachers who reported
that school rules were enforced by the principal was
lower in 2011–12 than in 2007–08 (84 vs. 89 percent).

School Environment

In 2011–12, the percentages of public school teachers
who reported that student misbehavior and student
tardiness and class cutting interfered with their
teaching varied by state. For example, among the 50
states and the District of Columbia, the percentage
of teachers who reported that student misbehavior
interfered with their teaching ranged from 31 percent
in Wyoming to 55 percent in Louisiana (table 12.3).
The percentages of teachers who reported that school
rules were enforced by other teachers and by the
principal also varied by state.

Indicator 13
Physical Fights on School Property and Anywhere
The percentage of students in grades 9 through 12 who reported being in a physical fight anywhere decreased
between 1993 and 2011 (from 42 to 33 percent) and the percentage of students who reported being in a
physical fight on school property also decreased during this period (from 16 to 12 percent).
Physical fights on school property are considered
a high-risk behavior that may disrupt a focused
learning environment at school; students involved in
physical fights on school property may face difficulties
succeeding in their studies (Payne, Gottfredson,
and Gottfredson 2003). In the Youth Risk Behavior
Survey, students in grades 9–12 were asked about their
general involvement in physical fights (referred to as
“anywhere” in this indicator), as well as about their
involvement in physical fights on school property,
during the 12 months preceding the survey.33 In
this indicator, fights occurring anywhere are used
as a point of comparison with fights occurring on
school property.

fight anywhere and on school property decreased
for all four grade levels (figure 13.1 and table 13.1).
Generally, a higher percentage of students in 9th
grade than in any other grade reported being in fights,
either anywhere or on school property. For example,
in 2011, about 38 percent of 9th-graders reported
being in a fight anywhere, compared with 30 percent
of 11th-graders and 27 percent of 12th-graders (there
was no measurable difference in the percentages of
9th-graders and 10th-graders who reported being
in a fight anywhere that year). Similarly, 16 percent
of 9th-graders, compared with 13 percent of 10thgraders, and 9 percent each of 11th- and 12th-graders
reported being in a fight on school property in 2011.

Overall, the percentage of students who reported
being in a physical fight anywhere decreased from
42 percent in 1993 to 33 percent in 2011. Similarly,
the percentage of students who reported being in a
physical fight on school property decreased from 16
percent in 1993 to 12 percent in 2011 (figure 13.1
and table 13.1). There was no measurable difference
between the 2009 and 2011 percentages of students in
grades 9–12 who reported being in a fight anywhere,
nor was there a measurable difference between the
2009 and 2011 percentages of students in these grades
who were in a fight on school property.

The percentage of students who reported being in a
physical fight differed by race/ethnicity in 2011 (figure
13.2 and table 13.1). A smaller percentage of Asian
students reported being in physical fights anywhere
and on school property than other racial/ethnic
groups. For example, 18 percent of Asian students
reported being in a physical fight anywhere at least
once during the previous 12 months, compared with
45 percent of students of two or more races, 43 percent
of Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students, 42
percent of American Indian/Alaska Native students,
39 percent of Black students, 37 percent of Hispanic
students, and 29 percent of White students. Six
percent of Asian students reported being in a fight on
school property at least once during the previous 12
months, compared with 21 percent of Pacific Islander/
Native Hawaiian students, 17 percent of students of
two or more races, 16 percent of Black students, 14
percent of Hispanic students, 12 percent of American
Indian/Alaska Native students, and 10 percent of
White students. In addition, smaller percentages of
White students reported being in fights anywhere
and on school property than Black, Hispanic, Pacific
Islander/Native Hawaiian, or students of two or more
races, and a smaller percentage of White students
reported being in fights anywhere compared with
American Indian/Alaska Natives.

Students were also asked how often they were in
physical fights during the past 12 months. In 2011,
about 24 percent of students had been in a fight
anywhere 1 to 3 times, 6 percent were in fights 4 to 11
times, and 3 percent were in fights 12 or more times
(table 13.2). About 10 percent of students were in a
fight on school property 1 to 3 times, 1 percent were
in fights 4 to 11 times, and 1 percent were in fights
12 or more times.
From 1993 through 2011, the percentage of students
in grades 9–12 who reported being in a physical

Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students are simply
asked how many times in the last 12 months they had been
in a physical fight. In the question that asks students about
physical fights at school, “on school property” was not
defined for survey respondents.

A greater percentage of males than females reported
being in a higher number of physical fights both
anywhere and on school property. For example, 4
percent of males reported being in a fight anywhere
twelve or more times in 2011, compared to 1 percent
of females. One percent of males reported being in
a fight on school property twelve or more times,
compared to less than half a percent of females (figure

available for 40 states and the District of Columbia.
Among these states, the percentage of students who
reported being in a fight anywhere ranged from 20
percent in Maine to 38 percent in the District of
Columbia, while the percentage of students who
reported being in a fight on school property ranged
from 7 percent in Massachusetts and Nebraska to 16

Indicator 14
Students Carrying Weapons on School Property and Anywhere
Between 1993 and 2011, the percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported carrying a weapon
anywhere at least once during the previous 30 days declined from 22 to 17 percent, and the percentage who
reported carrying a weapon on school property declined from 12 to 5 percent.
The presence of weapons at school may interfere with
teaching and learning by creating an intimidating
and threatening atmosphere (Aspy et al. 2004). In
the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), students
were asked if they had carried a weapon such as a gun,
knife, or club anywhere in the previous 30 days and
if they had carried such a weapon on school property
during the same time period.34 Weapon carrying
“anywhere” is included as a point of comparison with
weapon carrying on school property. In a different
survey, the School Crime Supplement (SCS), students
were asked if they could have gotten a loaded gun
without adult permission, either at school or away
from school, during the current school year. This
indicator discusses YRBS data first and concludes
with a discussion of students’ access to firearms at
school or away from school, using data from the
SCS. Readers should note the differing data sources
and terminology.
In 2011, some 17 percent of students in grades 9–12
reported that they had carried a weapon anywhere on
at least 1 day during the previous 30 days: 8 percent
carried a weapon anywhere on 6 or more days, 6
percent carried a weapon on 2 to 5 days, and 3 percent
carried a weapon on 1 day (tables 14.1 and 14.2). In
comparison, 5 percent of students reported carrying
a weapon on school property during the previous 30
days. This percentage was composed of 2 percent of
students who carried a weapon on 6 or more days, 1
percent who carried a weapon on 2 to 5 days, and 2
percent who carried a weapon on 1 day.
The percentage of students who reported carrying a
weapon anywhere in the previous 30 days declined
from 22 percent in 1993 to 17 percent in 2011, and
the percentage who reported carrying a weapon on
school property declined from 12 percent in 1993 to 5

percent in 2011. There was no measurable difference,
however, between the 2009 and 2011 percentages of
students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere,
nor was there a measurable difference between the
2009 and 2011 percentages of students who reported
carrying a weapon on school property.
In every survey year from 1993 to 2011, a higher
percentage of males than females reported that
they had carried a weapon, both anywhere and on
school property (figure 14.1 and table 14.1). In 2011,
for example, 26 percent of males carried a weapon
anywhere, compared to 7 percent of females, and 8
percent of males carried a weapon on school property,
compared to 2 percent of females.
In 2011, a smaller percentage of Asian students than
students of any other racial/ethnic group reported
carrying a weapon anywhere in the previous 30 days
(figure 14.2 and table 14.1). Nine percent of Asian
students reported carrying a weapon anywhere in the
previous 30 days, compared with 14 percent of Black
students, 16 percent of Hispanic students, 17 percent
of White students, 21 percent of Pacific Islander/
Native Hawaiian students, 24 percent of students
of two or more races, and 28 percent of American
Indian/Alaska Native students. In addition, the
percentages of White, Black, and Hispanic students
who reported carrying a weapon anywhere in the
previous 30 days were lower than the percentages
for American Indian/Alaska Native students and
students of two or more races. The percentage of
students who reported they had carried a weapon
on school property over the previous 30 days ranged
from 4 to 11 percent across racial/ethnic groups in
2011; however, there were no measurable differences
between these groups.

There were no measurable differences between the
percentages of students at each of the grade levels
9 through 12 who reported carrying a weapon
anywhere during the previous 30 days. In 2011, about
16 percent each of 11th-graders and 12th-graders,
and 17 percent each of 9th-graders and 10th-graders
reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the
previous 30 days. Similarly, the percentages of
students who reported carrying a weapon on school
property during the previous 30 days did not differ
measurably by grade level: 5 percent each of 9thgraders and 11th-graders and 6 percent each of
10th-graders and 12th-graders reported carrying a
weapon on school property in 2011.
In 2011, state-level data on percentages of public
school students who reported carrying a weapon
anywhere were available for 37 states and the District
of Columbia, and state-level data on percentages of
students who reported carrying a weapon on school
property were available for 39 states and the District
of Columbia (table 14.3). Among these states, the
percentage of students who reported carrying a
weapon anywhere ranged from 10 percent in New
Jersey and Wisconsin to 27 percent in Wyoming,
while the percentage of students who reported
carrying a weapon on school property ranged from
3 percent in Wisconsin to 11 percent in Wyoming.

Fights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances

Information about students’ access to firearms can
put student reports of carrying a gun anywhere and
on school property into context. The 2007, 2009, and
2011 SCS surveys provide data on the percentage of
students ages 12–18 who reported having access to a
loaded gun without adult permission, either at school
or away from school, during the school year. In 2011,
about 5 percent of students ages 12–18 reported
having access to a loaded gun during the school year
(table 14.4).
In 2011, lower percentages of students in grades 7
and 8 reported having access to a gun without adult
permission than students in grades 10, 11, and 12.
Three percent each of 7th- and 8th-grade students
reported having access to a gun, compared with 5
percent of 10th-graders, 6 percent of 11th-graders,
and 8 percent of 12th-graders. The percentage of
12th-graders reporting that they had access to a gun
(8 percent) was also higher than that of 9th-graders
(4 percent) and 10th-graders (5 percent).
The percentage of students reporting that they had
access to a gun without adult permission was lower in
2009 and 2011 (6 percent and 5 percent, respectively)
than it was in 2007 (7 percent). In all three survey
years, a higher percentage of male students than
female students reported having access to a gun. For
example, in 2011, about 6 percent of males reported
having access to a gun, compared with 4 percent of
females.

Indicator 15
Students’ Use of Alcohol on School Property and Anywhere
In 2011, about 39 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported having at least one drink of alcohol anywhere
during the previous 30 days, and 5 percent had at least one drink on school property. Among female students,
the percentage who reported consuming alcohol anywhere decreased from 2009 to 2011, while the percentage
who reported consuming alcohol on school property increased.
Alcohol consumption on school property is an illegal
behavior of students, which may lead to additional
crimes and misbehavior (Kodjo, Auinger, and Ryan
2003). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in
grades 9–12 were asked if they had consumed alcohol
anywhere during the previous 30 days and if they
had consumed alcohol on school property during the
same time period.35 Consuming alcohol “anywhere”
in this indicator is included as a point of comparison
with consuming alcohol on school property. In
most states, purchase or public possession of alcohol
anywhere by students in grades 9–12 is illegal, since
most students are under the state’s minimum legal
drinking age. Overall, the percentage of students who
reported consuming alcohol anywhere during the
previous 30 days decreased from 48 percent in 1993
to 39 percent in 2011. The percentage of students
who reported consuming alcohol on school property
in the previous 30 days in 2011 was not measurably
different from the 1993 percentage (5 percent each;
figure 15.1 and table 15.1).
In 2011, about 19 percent of students in grades 9–12
reported using alcohol anywhere on 1 or 2 days during
the previous 30 days (table 15.2). Eighteen percent
reported using alcohol anywhere on 3 to 29 of the
previous 30 days, and one percent reported using
alcohol anywhere on all of the previous 30 days. In
addition, 3 percent of students reported using alcohol
on school property on 1 or 2 of the previous 30 days,
1 percent of students reported using alcohol on school
property on 3 to 29 of the previous 30 days, and
one-half percent of students reported using alcohol
on school property on all of the previous 30 days.
In the survey years since 2003, there have been no
measurable differences between the percentages of
male and female students who reported consuming
alcohol anywhere on at least one of the previous 30

Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students are simply

days (figure 15.1 and table 15.1). However, in 2011
there were differences by sex in the number of days
students reported having used alcohol. A higher
percentage of males than females reported consuming
alcohol anywhere on 3 to 29 days (19 vs. 17 percent)
and all 30 days (1 percent vs. less than one-half
percent; figure 15.2 and table 15.2).
In every survey year between 1993 and 2009, a higher
percentage of males than females reported using
alcohol on school property (figure 15.1 and table
15.1). However, in 2011 there was no measurable
difference between the percentages of male and female
students reporting consuming alcohol at least one
day on school property (5 percent each). In 2011,
a higher percentage of male than female students
reported consuming alcohol on school property on
all of the previous 30 days (1 percent vs. less than
one-half percent).
From 2009 to 2011, there was no measurable change
in the percentages of male students who reported
alcohol consumption anywhere or on school property.
Among females, however, the percentage of students
who reported alcohol consumption any where
decreased from 43 percent in 2009 to 38 percent
in 2011, and the percentage of female students who
reported alcohol consumption on school property
increased from 4 to 5 percent over the same time
period (figure 15.1 and table 15.1).
In 2011, about 48 percent of 12th-graders reported
consuming alcohol anywhere at least one day during
the previous 30 days (figure 15.3 and table 15.1). This
percentage was higher than the 2011 percentages for
9th-graders (30 percent), 10th-graders (36 percent),
and 11th-graders (43 percent). In addition, a higher
percentage of 12th-graders (27 percent) than 9thgraders (11 percent), 10th-graders (16 percent), or
11th-graders (21 percent) reported consuming alcohol
anywhere on 3 to 29 of the previous 30 days (table
15.2). There were no measurable differences in alcohol
consumption on school property among the grades
in 2011.

Students’ Use of Marijuana on School Property and Anywhere
In 2011, some 23 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported using marijuana anywhere at least one time
in the previous 30 days, and 6 percent reported using marijuana at least one time on school property over
the same time period.
The Youth Risk Behavior Survey asked students
in grades 9–12 whether they had used marijuana
anywhere in the previous 30 days, as well as whether
they had used marijuana on school property during
that time.36 In 2011, some 23 percent of students in
grades 9–12 reported using marijuana anywhere at
least one time in the previous 30 days, and 6 percent
reported using marijuana at least one time on school
property over the same time period. The percentage
of students who reported using marijuana anywhere
was higher in 2011 than it was in 1993 (23 vs. 18
percent); however, there was no measurable difference
between the 2011 and 1993 percentages of students
who reported using marijuana on school property
(6 percent in both years; figure 16.1 and table 16.1).
In addition, the 2011 percentages of students who
reported using marijuana anywhere and on school
property were higher than the 2009 percentages. In
2009, about 21 percent of students reported using
marijuana anywhere in the previous 30 days, and 5
percent reported using marijuana on school property
in the previous 30 days.
In every survey year, higher percentages of males than
females reported using marijuana anywhere and on
school property at least one time in the previous 30
days (figure 16.1 and table 16.1). For example, in 2011
about 26 percent of males reported using marijuana
at least once anywhere in the previous 30 days,
compared with 20 percent of females. Eight percent
of male students reported that they used marijuana on
school property in 2011, compared with 4 percent of
female students. There were also differences between
the percentages of males and females who reported
using marijuana 40 or more times in the previous 30
days in 2011 (figure 16.2 and table 16.2): 7 percent
of males reported using marijuana 40 or more times
anywhere in the previous 30 days, compared with 2

percent of females, and 1 percent of males reported
using marijuana 40 times or more on school property,
compared with less than one-half a percent of females.
In 2011, the percentage of Asian students who
reported using marijuana anywhere at least one
time in the previous 30 days was lower than the
percentages for other racial/ethnic groups (figure 16.3
and table 16.1). Fourteen percent of Asian students
reported using marijuana anywhere, compared
with 22 percent of White students; 24 percent of
Hispanic students; 25 percent of Black students; 27
percent of students of two or more races; 31 percent
of Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students; and 47
percent of American Indian/Alaska Native students.
In the same year, a higher percentage of American
Indian/Alaska Native students reported having used
marijuana on school property at least one time in
the previous 30 days than most other racial/ethnic
groups. Additionally, a higher percentage of Hispanic
students than White or Asian students reported
having used marijuana on school property, and a
higher percentage of Black students than White
students reported having done so.
In 2011, a smaller percentage of 9th-graders (18
percent) than 10th-graders (22 percent), 11th-graders
(26 percent), or 12th-graders (28 percent) reported
using marijuana anywhere, and a lower percentage
of 10th-graders than 11th- or 12th-graders reported
doing so (figure 16.4 and table 16.1). There were no
measurable differences between the percentages of
students in any of grades 9–12 who reported the use
of marijuana on school property in 2011.

Indicator 17
Students’ Perceptions of Personal Safety at School and Away From
School
In 2011, a higher percentage of students ages 12–18 reported that they were afraid of attack or harm at
school (4 percent) than away from school (2 percent) during the school year.
School violence can make students fearful and affect
their readiness and ability to learn, and concerns
about vulnerability to attacks can detract from a
positive school environment (Scheckner et al. 2002).
In the School Crime Supplement to the National
Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18
were asked how often37 they had been afraid of attack
or harm “at school or on the way to and from school”
as well as “away from school.”38 In 2011, a higher
percentage of students ages 12–18 reported that they
were afraid of attack or harm at school (4 percent)
than away from school (2 percent) during the school
year (figure 17.1 and table 17.1).
In 2011, a lower percentage of White students (3
percent) than of Hispanic students (5 percent)
reported being afraid of attack or harm at school,
and a lower percentage of White students (2 percent)
than of Black and Hispanic students (3 percent each)
reported being afraid of attack or harm away from
school. The percentage of students who reported being
afraid of attack or harm at school or away from school
in 2011 did not measurably differ by sex. Four percent
each of female and male students reported being
afraid of attack or harm at school, and 3 percent of
females and 2 percent of males reported being afraid
of attack or harm away from school.
The percentages of students who reported being afraid
of attack or harm at school or away from school in
2011 tended to be greater for students in lower grades
than for those in upper grades. For example, higher
percentages of 6th-graders (6 percent), 7th-graders (4
percent), 8th-graders (5 percent), and 9th-graders (4
percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm at
school than 11th-graders and 12th-graders (2 percent
each). The percentage of 10th-graders (4 percent) who
reported being afraid of attack or harm at school

was also higher than the percentage of 11th-graders.
Away from school, higher percentages of 6th-, 7th-,
9th-, and 11th-graders (3 to 4 percent each) reported
being afraid of attack or harm than 12th-graders (1
percent). The percentage of 9th-graders (4 percent)
who reported being afraid of attack or harm away
from school was also higher than the percentage of
10th-graders (2 percent).
Both at school and away from school, higher
percentages of students in urban areas reported being
afraid of attack or harm than students in suburban
and rural areas. Specifically, 5 percent of students in
urban areas reported being afraid of attack or harm
at school, compared with 3 percent each of students
in rural areas and suburban areas. Three percent of
students in urban areas reported being afraid of attack
or harm away from school, compared with 2 percent
of students in suburban areas and 1 percent of those
in rural areas.
In 2011, a higher percentage of students in public
schools (4 percent) than of students in private schools
(2 percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm
at school.
Between 1995 and 2011, the percentage of students
who reported being afraid of attack or harm at
school decreased from 12 to 4 percent (figure 17.2).
A declining trend was also observed away from
school: between 1999 and 2011, the percentage
of students who reported being afraid of attack or
harm decreased from 6 to 2 percent. From 2009 to
2011, no measurable differences were found in the
percentage of students who feared attack or harm
at school; however, the percentage of students who
feared attack or harm away from school was lower in
2011 (2 percent) than in 2009 (3 percent).

37

 Students were asked if they “never,” “almost never,”
“sometimes,” or “most of the time” feared attack or harm
at school or away from school. Students responding
“sometimes” or “most of the time” were considered fearful.
38
 “At school” includes the school building, on school
property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to
and from school.

Indicator 18
Students’ Reports of Avoiding School Activities or Specific Places
in School
In 2011, about 6 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they avoided school activities or one or
more places in school because they thought someone might attack or harm them.
School crime may lead students to perceive school
as unsafe, and in trying to ensure their own
safety, students may skip school activities or avoid
certain places in school (Schreck and Miller 2003).
To measure students’ perception of safety, the
School Crime Supplement to the National Crime
Victimization Survey asks students ages 12–18
whether they avoided school activities or one or
more places in school because they were fearful that
someone might attack or harm them.39 In 2011, about
6 percent of students reported that they avoided
at least one school activity or one or more places
in school during the previous school year because
they feared being attacked or harmed. Specifically,
2 percent avoided at least one school activity, and 5
percent avoided one or more places in school40 (figure
18.1 and table 18.1).

cafeteria, and any school restrooms; 1 percent each
reported that they avoided the entrance to the school
and other places inside the school building.

There was no overall pattern of increase or decrease
between 1999 and 2011 in the percentage of students
who reported that they avoided at least one school
activity or one or more places in school because of fear
of attack or harm, and the percentage of students who
reported this avoidance in 2011 (6 percent) was not
measurably different from that in 2009 (5 percent).
In 2011, about 1 percent each of students reported
that they avoided any activities, avoided any classes,
and stayed home from school. By school building
location, 2 percent each of students reported that
they avoided the hallways or stairs, parts of the school

In 2011, students’ reports of avoiding one or more
places in school also varied by urbanicity. A higher
percentage of students in urban areas (5 percent) than
in rural areas (4 percent) reported avoiding one of
more places in school. Also, there were differences by
school sector: a higher percentage of students in public
schools (5 percent) than in private schools (2 percent)
reported avoiding one or more places in school.

Students’ reports of avoiding one or more places
in school because of fear of attack or harm varied
by student characteristics in 2011 (figure 18.2). A
higher percentage of Hispanic students (6 percent)
than White students (4 percent), Asian students
(3 percent), and “other” race/ethnicity students (3
percent) reported avoiding one or more places in
school. By grade, a higher percentage of 6th-graders
(7 percent) than 9th-graders, 11th-graders, or 12thgraders (4 percent each) reported avoiding one or
more places in school. Also, a higher percentage of
female than male students (5 vs. 4 percent) reported
avoiding one or more places in school.

39

 For the 2001 survey, the wording was changed
from “attack or harm” to “attack or threat of attack.” See
appendix A for more information.
40
 “Avoided school activities” includes avoiding any
(extracurricular) activities, skipping class, or staying home
from school. In 2007, 2009, and 2011, the survey wording
was changed from “any extracurricular activities” to “any
activities.” Please use caution when comparing changes in
this item over time. “Avoiding one or more places in school”
includes avoiding the entrance, any hallways or stairs, parts
of the cafeteria, restrooms, and other places inside the school
building.

Serious Disciplinary Actions Taken by Public Schools
During the 2009–10 school year, 39 percent of public schools took at least one serious disciplinary action
against a student for specific offenses. A total of 433,800 serious disciplinary actions were taken by public
schools during this period.
In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public
school principals were asked to report the number
of disciplinary actions their schools had taken
against students for specific offenses. The student
offenses were physical attacks or fights; distribution,
possession, or use of alcohol; distribution, possession,
or use of illegal drugs; use or possession of a firearm
or explosive device; and use or possession of a weapon
other than a firearm or explosive device.
During the 2009–10 school year, 39 percent of public
schools (32,300 schools) took at least one serious
disciplinary action—including suspensions lasting
5 days or more, removals with no services for the
remainder of the school year (i.e., expulsions), and
transfers to specialized schools—for specific offenses
(table 19.1).
Out of all offenses reported, physical attacks or
fights prompted the largest percentage of schools
(29 percent) to respond with at least one serious
disciplinary action (figure 19.1 and table 19.1). In
response to other offenses by students, 20 percent of
schools reported that they took disciplinary action for
the distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs;
13 percent took action for the use or possession of
a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device;
9 percent did so for the distribution, possession, or
use of alcohol; and 3 percent did so for the use or
possession of a firearm or explosive device.
No linear trends were detected in the percentages
of schools that took at least one serious disciplinary
action for any of the reported offenses over time
between 2003–04 and 2009–10, although the
percentage of schools taking at least one serious
disciplinary action for physical attacks or fights
declined between 1999–2000 (35 percent) and
2009–10 (29 percent).

During the 2009–10 school year, the percentage of
public schools that took serious disciplinary actions
increased with school level. A higher percentage of
high schools (83 percent) took at least one serious
disciplinary action than did middle schools (67
percent) and primary schools (18 percent). Combined
schools (schools that provide instruction at both
elementary and secondary grades) took at least one
serious disciplinary action at a higher percentage
(49 percent) than primary schools, but at a lower
percentage than either middle schools or high
schools. This pattern by school level was generally
observed for disciplinary actions taken in response
to specific offenses as well. For example, 66 percent
of high schools took serious disciplinary actions in
response to distribution, possession, or use of illegal
drugs, compared with 37 percent of middle schools,
23 percent of combined schools, and 2 percent of
primary schools.
A total of 433,800 serious disciplinary actions were
taken by public schools during the 2009–10 school
year for specific offenses. Most of these reported
disciplinary actions were taken in response to physical
attacks or fights (265,100 actions). The number of
disciplinary actions taken in response to the use or
possession of a firearm or explosive device (5,800
actions) was smaller than for other offenses reported.
Of the serious disciplinary actions taken during the
2009–10 school year, 74 percent were suspensions
for 5 days or more, 20 percent were transfers to
specialized schools, and 6 percent were removals
with no services for the remainder of the school year.

NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. Serious disciplinary actions include removals with no continuing services for at least the remainder of the school year, transfers to specialized schools for disciplinary
reasons, and out-of-school suspensions lasting 5 or more days, but less than the remainder of the school year. Respondents were instructed to
respond only for those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified
otherwise.

Indicator 20
Safety and Security Measures Taken by Schools
During the 2011–12 school year, 88 percent of public schools reported that they controlled access to school
buildings by locking or monitoring doors during school hours, and 64 percent reported that they used security
cameras to monitor the school. In the 2009–10 school year, 43 percent of schools reported the presence of
one or more security staff at their school at least once a week during the school year.
Schools use a variety of practices and procedures
to promote the safety of students and staff. In the
Schools and Staffing Survey, principals of public
and private schools were asked about their schools’
use of safety and security measures and procedures.
Certain practices, such as locking or monitoring
doors or gates, are intended to limit or control access
to school campuses, while others, such as the use of
metal detectors and security cameras, are intended
to monitor or restrict students’ and visitors’ behavior
on campus. Another measure of safety and security,
collected in the School Survey on Crime and Safety,
is the presence of full-time and part-time security staff
in public schools during the school year.
In the 2011–12 school year, 88 percent of public
schools reported that they controlled access to school
buildings by locking or monitoring doors during
school hours (table 20.1). Other safety and security
measures frequently reported by public schools
included the use of security cameras to monitor the
school (64 percent) and the enforcement of a strict
dress code (49 percent) (figure 20.1). In addition, 44
percent of public schools reported that they controlled
access to school grounds by locking or monitoring

gates during school hours, 24 percent reported the
use of random dog sniffs to check for drugs, and 19
percent required that students wear uniforms.
In general, higher percentages of public than of
private schools reported the use of various safety and
security measures in the 2011–12 school year (table
20.1). For example, higher percentages of public than
of private schools reported the use of security cameras
(64 vs. 41 percent) and random dog sniffs to check for
drugs (24 vs. 4 percent). Higher percentages of public
than of private schools also reported the following
measures: controlling access to school buildings
during school hours; requiring that students wear
badges or picture IDs; requiring that book bags be
clear or banning them from school; conducting metal
detector checks on students (including both random
and daily checks); and conducting random sweeps
for contraband.41 However, higher percentages of
private than of public schools enforced a strict dress
code (71 vs. 49 percent) and required that students
wear uniforms (57 vs. 19 percent).

In the 2011–12 school year, higher percentages of
public secondary schools or combined schools than
of elementary schools reported using the following
safety and security measures: enforcing a strict dress
code; requiring that students wear badges or picture
IDs; requiring that book bags be clear or banning
them from school; conducting metal detector checks
on students (including both random and daily
checks); using random dog sniffs to check for drugs;
conducting random sweeps for contraband;42 and
using security cameras to monitor the school (table
20.1). For example, among public schools, 81 percent
of secondary schools, 72 percent of combined schools,
and 58 percent of elementary schools reported the
use of security cameras to monitor the school (table
20.1). In addition, the percentage of public secondary
schools who reported using random dog sniffs for
drugs (57 percent) was higher than the percentages of
combined schools (41 percent) and elementary schools
(11 percent) with such a procedure in place. However,
lower percentages of public secondary schools (84
percent) and combined schools (83 percent) than of
elementary schools (90 percent) reported controlling
access to buildings during school hours. Also, the
percentage of public secondary schools who reported
requiring that students wear uniforms (12 percent)
was lower than the percentages of elementary schools
(20 percent) and combined schools (30 percent) with
such a requirement.
The use of safety and security measures in the
2011–12 school year also varied by public school
locale (table 20.2). Higher percentages of public city
schools than of public schools in suburban, town,
and rural areas reported the following measures:
controlling access to school grounds during school
hours; requiring that students wear uniforms;

Many safety and security measures tended to be more
prevalent in high-poverty public schools (where 76
percent or more of students are eligible for free or
reduced-price lunch) than in low-poverty schools
(where 25 percent or less of students are eligible for
free or reduced-price lunch) during the 2011–12
school year (table 20.2). Higher percentages of highpoverty public schools than of low-poverty schools
reported controlling access to school grounds during
school hours; requiring that students wear uniforms;
enforcing a strict dress code; requiring that students
wear badges or picture IDs; requiring that book bags
be clear or banning them from school; conducting
metal detector checks on students (including both
random and daily checks); and conducting sweeps
for contraband.42 For instance, 64 percent of
high-poverty public schools reported enforcing a
strict dress code, compared with 38 percent of lowpoverty schools. Also, 47 percent of high-poverty
public schools reported requiring school uniforms,
compared to 6 percent of low poverty public schools.

enforcing a strict dress code; requiring that students

city schools reported controlling access to school
grounds, compared with 46 percent of suburban
schools and 37 percent each of public schools in towns
and rural areas. However, public city schools had the
lowest reported percentage of schools with security
cameras (59 percent of city schools vs. between 65 and
67 percent of rural, suburban, and town schools). In
addition, higher percentages of public town and rural
schools than of city and suburban schools reported
the use of random dog sniffs for drugs and random
sweeps for contraband.

The percentages of public schools reporting the use
of various safety and security measures in 2011–12
tended to be higher or not measurably different from
the percentages reported in 2003–04 (figure 20.2
and table 20.1). For example, the percentage of public
schools reporting that they required that students wear
uniforms increased from 13 to 19 percent between the
2003–04 and 2011–12 school years. Public schools’
reported use of security cameras to monitor the school
increased from 2003–04 (32 percent) to 2011–12
(64 percent). Also, the percentage of public schools
reporting that they controlled access to buildings
during school hours was higher in 2011–12 than in
2003–04 (88 vs. 82 percent). A similar pattern was
observed for controlled access to grounds during
school hours (44 percent in 2011–12 vs. 39 percent
in 2003–04).
In the 2009–10 school year, 43 percent of public
schools reported the presence of one or more security
guards, security personnel, School Resource Officers,
or sworn law enforcement officers at their school
at least once a week during the school year (table
20.3).43 The percentage of public schools reporting
the presence of security staff did not measurably differ
between 2005–06 (42 percent) and 2009–10 (43
percent); however, the percentage of public schools
reporting the presence of security staff was higher
in 2007–08 (46 percent) than in either 2005–06
or 2009–10. Twenty-nine percent of public schools
reported having at least one full-time employed
security staff who was present at least once a week,
and 14 percent of public schools reported having only
part-time staff. A lower percentage of public schools
reported full-time security staff at their school in
2005–06 (27 percent) than in 2007–08 (30 percent),
while there were no measurable differences between
each of these percentages and the percentage reported
in 2009–10 (29 percent). No measurable differences
were found across years for the percentages of public
schools reporting part-time only security staff.

About 28 percent of public primary schools reported
the presence of one or more security staff at their
school at least once a week in 2009–10. The
percentage of public primary schools reporting
security staff was lower than the percentages of middle
schools and high schools reporting the presence of
security staff (66 and 76 percent, respectively) but
was not measurably different from the percentage
of combined schools reporting the presence of
security staff. A higher percentage of public high
schools (62 percent) than of primary (16 percent),
combined (24 percent), or middle schools (46 percent)
reported having full-time security staff (table 20.3).
Differences in the presence of security staff were also
found by other school characteristics. For example,
the percentage of public city schools that reported the
presence of one or more security staff at least once a
week during the 2009–10 school year (51 percent)
was higher than the percentages of town schools
(39 percent) and rural schools (35 percent). The
percentage of public suburban schools reporting the
presence of security staff (45 percent) was also higher
than the percentage of rural schools.
Public schools were also asked to report whether
any of their security staff routinely carried a firearm
at school.44 In 2009–10, some 28 percent of all
public schools reported the presence of security
staff routinely carrying a firearm (table 20.3). The
percentage of public schools reporting security staff
routinely carrying firearms was higher in 2007–08
(34 percent) than in either 2005–06 (31 percent)
or 2009–10 (28 percent); there was no measurable
difference between 2005–06 and 2009–10. Twelve
percent of public primary schools, 25 percent of
combined schools, 51 percent of middle schools, and
63 percent of high schools reported the presence of
one or more security staff at their schools routinely
carrying firearms during the 2009–10 school year.

Students’ Reports of Safety and Security Measures Observed
at School
In 2011, about 77 percent of students ages 12–18 reported observing one or more security cameras to
monitor the school during the day at their schools, and 70 percent of students reported the presence of
security guards and/or assigned police officers.
Schools use a variety of measures to promote the
safety of students, ranging from codes of student
conduct to metal detectors. In the School Crime
Supplement to the National Crime Victimization
Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked whether their
schools used certain security measures.45 Security
measures include metal detectors, locker checks,
security cameras, security guards or police officers,
adult supervision in hallways, badges or picture
identification for students, a code of student conduct,
locked entrance or exit doors during the day, and a
requirement that visitors sign in. In 2011, nearly all
students ages 12–18 reported that they observed the
use of at least one of the selected security measures at
their schools (figure 21.1 and table 21.1).

increased between the two most recent survey years
as well as over the past 10 years. Specifically, 77
percent of students reported observing the use of one
or more security cameras at their schools in 2011,
which represented an increase from 70 percent in
2009 as well as an overall increase from 39 percent
in 2001. Regarding the school security measure of
having locked entrance or exit doors during the day,
the percentage of students who reported observing
this security measure increased from 38 percent in
1999 to 65 percent in 2011. Over the same period, the
percentage of students who reported a requirement
that visitors sign in increased (87 vs. 95 percent) as
did the percentage who reported the presence of metal
detectors at school (9 vs. 11 percent).

In 2011, most students ages 12–18 reported that their
schools had a code of student conduct (96 percent)
and a requirement that visitors sign in (95 percent).
Approximately 89 percent of students reported
the presence of other school staff or other adult
supervision in the hallway, and 77 percent of students
reported the use of one or more security cameras at
their schools. Seventy percent of students reported
the presence of security guards and/or assigned police
officers, 65 percent reported locked entrance or exit
doors during the day, and 53 percent reported locker
checks. In addition, 25 percent of students reported
that the wearing of badges or picture identification
was required at their schools. Metal detectors were
the least observed of the selected safety and security
measures: 11 percent of students reported the use of
metal detectors at their schools.

The percentage of students who reported the presence
of security guards and/or assigned police officers was
not measurably different from 2009 to 2011. The
percentage of students who reported the presence of
security guards and/or police officers increased from
54 percent in 1999 to 64 percent in 2001 and to 70
percent in 2003; however, there was no significant
trend in this percentage between 2003 and 2011.

The percentage of students who reported the presence
of one or more security cameras to monitor the school

From 2009 to 2011, the percentage of students who
reported other school staff or other adult supervision
in the hallway decreased from 91 to 89 percent,
although the percentage in 2011 was not measurably
different from the percentage in 1999. Between the
earliest survey year for which data were reported
and 2011, no measurable increases or decreases were
detected in the percentages of students who reported
locker checks, requirements that students wear badges
or picture identification, or a code of student conduct

Indicator 22
Criminal Incidents at Postsecondary Institutions
In 2011, there were 30,400 criminal incidents on campus at public and private 2-year and 4-year
postsecondary institutions that were reported to police and security agencies, representing a 5 percent decrease
from 2010 (31,900). There was also a decrease in the number of on-campus crimes reported per 10,000
full-time-equivalent students, from 20.8 in 2010 to 19.7 in 2011.
Since 1990, postsecondary institutions participating
in Title IV federal student financial aid programs
have been required to comply with the Jeanne Clery
Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus
Crime Statistics Act, known as the Clery Act. The
Clery Act requires institutions to give timely warnings
about crimes to students and staff; to publicly report
campus crime and safety policies; and to collect,
report, and disseminate campus crime data. Since
1999, data on campus safety and security have been
reported by institutions through the Campus Safety
and Security Survey. These reports include on-campus
criminal offenses and arrests involving students,
faculty, staff, and the general public. Reports on
referrals for disciplinary action primarily deal with
persons associated formally with the institution (i.e.,
students, faculty, and other staff).
In 2011, there were 30,400 criminal incidents on
campus at public and private 2-year and 4-year
postsecondary institutions that were reported to
police and security agencies, representing a 5 percent
decrease from 2010 (31,900; table 22.1). Also, there
was a decrease in the number of on-campus crimes
per 10,000 full-time-equivalent (FTE) students, from
20.8 in 2010 to 19.7 in 2011 (table 22.2).
Among the various types of on-campus crimes
reported in 2011, there were 19,500 burglaries,
constituting 64 percent of all criminal incidents (table
22.1 and figure 22.1). Other commonly reported
crimes included motor vehicle theft (11 percent of
crimes or 3,400 incidents) and forcible sex offenses
(11 percent or 3,300 incidents). There were 2,200
aggravated assaults reported and 1,300 robberies.
These estimates translate to 12.7 burglaries, 2.2 motor
vehicle thefts, 2.2 forcible sex offenses, 1.4 aggravated

assaults, and 0.8 robberies per 10,000 FTE students
(table 22.2). Fifteen murders occurred on college
campuses in 2011, the same number as in 2010.
Looking at on-campus crime patterns over a longer
period, the number of crimes in 2011 was lower
than the number reported in 2001. The number of
reported on-campus crimes increased by 7 percent,
from 41,600 in 2001 to 44,500 in 2006 (table 22.1).
However, between 2006 and 2011 the number
of crimes decreased by 32 percent to 30,400. The
number of on-campus crimes reported in 2011
was lower than in 2001 for every category, except
for forcible sex offenses. The number of reported
forcible sex crimes on campus reported increased by
52 percent, from 2,200 in 2001 to 3,300 in 2011.
Increases in FTE college enrollment between 2001
and 2011 as well as changes in the number of crimes
affected the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000
FTE students (see Digest of Education Statistics 2013 for
details about college enrollment). Overall, the number
of on-campus crimes per 10,000 students was lower in
2011 (19.7 per 10,000) than in 2001 (35.6 per 10,000;
table 22.2). Between 2001 and 2006, enrollment
increased by a larger percentage than the number
of crimes, and the number of on-campus crimes per
10,000 students in 2006 (33.3) was lower than in 2001
(35.6). Between 2006 and 2011, the number of reported
crimes decreased, enrollment increased, and the number
of on-campus crimes per 10,000 students decreased
from 33.3 to 19.7. The rates per 10,000 students for all
types of reported crimes on campus were lower in 2011
than in 2001, except in the case of forcible sex offenses,
which was higher in 2011 (2.2 per 10,000 students)
than in 2001 (1.9 per 10,000 students).

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2013

In 2011, the number of crimes committed on
college campuses differed by type of institution,
though to some extent this reflects the enrollment
size of the sectors and the presence of student
residence halls. For example, more crimes were
committed at institutions with residence halls
than at institutions without residence halls (table
22.2). Crimes involving students on campus after
normal class hours, such as in residence halls, are
included in campus crime reports, while crimes
involving students off campus are not. At public
4-year institutions in 2011, 49 percent of the 14,679
on-campus crimes occurred in residence halls;
at nonprofit 4-year institutions 61 percent of the
10,742 on-campus crimes occurred in residence
halls (table 22.1).
Although data for different types of institutions
are difficult to compare directly because of the
differing structures of student services and campus
arrangements, there were decreases in the numbers
of on-campus crimes at most types of institutions
between 2006 and 2011. At public 4-year institutions,
the number of on-campus crimes decreased from a
high of 20,600 in 2006 to 14,700 in 2011. Also, the
number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 students
decreased from 35.5 to 21.9 during this period (table
22.2). Similarly, at nonprofit 4-year institutions, the
number of crimes decreased from 16,900 in 2006
to 10,700 in 2011, and the number of crimes per
10,000 students decreased from 57.7 to 33.0. At
public 2-year institutions, which generally do not
have residence halls, the number of crimes declined
from 5,700 to 4,100 between 2006 and 2011, and
the number of crimes per 10,000 students decreased
from 15.4 to 9.7.
As part of the Clery Act, institutions are required to
report the number of arrests made for illegal weapons
possession and drug and liquor law violations on
college campuses. In contrast to the decreases in
reported on-campus crimes, the total number of

arrests for illegal weapons possession and drug and
liquor law violations increased from 40,300 in 2001
to 54,600 in 2011 (table 22.1 and figure 22.2).
While the number of arrests for weapons possession
was 4 percent lower in 2011 than in 2001 (1,000 vs.
1,100), there were increases in the larger categories
of drug and liquor law violations. Arrests for drug
law violations increased by 75 percent during this
period, reaching 20,700, and arrests for liquor law
violations rose by 20 percent, reaching 32,900. Some
of the increase in arrests may be associated with
increases in student enrollment during this period.
The number of arrests for drug law violations per
10,000 students increased from 10.2 to 13.5 (table
22.2); however, the number of arrests per 10,000
students for liquor law violations was lower in 2011
(21.3) than in 2001 (23.5).
There were some differences in the patterns of oncampus arrests among institution types. At public
4-year institutions, the number of on-campus
arrests per 10,000 students was higher in 2011
than in 2001 (67.1 vs. 60.1). In contrast, there was
a decrease in the number of on-campus arrests per
10,000 students at nonprofit 4-year institutions,
from 24.5 to 16.8. The number of on-campus arrests
per 10,000 students at public 2-year institutions in
2011 was 8.9, which was higher than in 2001 (7.8)
but lower than in 2006 (10.9).
In addition to on-campus arrests, institutions report
referrals for disciplinary actions for cases involving
illegal weapons possession, drug law violations, and
liquor law violations. Disciplinary action counts
only include incidents for which there were referrals
for institutional disciplinary actions but no arrest
was made. In 2011, there were 250,600 referrals for
disciplinary actions for cases involving weapons,
drugs, and liquor law violations, with the largest
number of these (197,200) involving liquor law
violations (table 22.1). The majority of referrals (89
percent) involved violations in residence halls.

Similar to the number of on-campus arrests for drug
and liquor law violations, the number of disciplinary
referrals for these incidents has increased. The number
of referrals for drug law violations rose by 118 percent,
from 23,900 in 2001 to 52,000 in 2011 (figure 22.3).
The number of referrals for liquor law violations rose
by 52 percent, from 130,000 to 197,200. The number
of disciplinary referrals for illegal weapons possession
was lower in 2011 (1,300) than in 2006 (1,900), but it
was about the same as in 2001 (1,300). Some of these
increases may be associated with more students on
college campuses; however, there were increases in the
number of disciplinary actions per 10,000 students,
as the number of disciplinary actions rose faster than
enrollment. The number of disciplinary referrals for
drug law violations increased from 20.5 per 10,000
students in 2001 to 33.8 per 10,000 students in 2011
(table 22.2). Also, the number of referrals for liquor

100

Postsecondary Campus Safety and Security

law violations per 10,000 students was higher in 2011
(128.1) than in 2001 (111.3). In contrast, the number
of referrals per 10,000 students for illegal weapons
possession was lower in 2011 (0.9) than in 2001 (1.1).
Both public 4-year and nonprofit 4-year institutions
had increases in disciplinary referrals between 2001
and 2011. At public 4-year institutions, the number
of referrals for disciplinary actions involving illegal
weapons, drug law violations, and liquor law violations
increased from 153.1 per 10,000 students in 2001 to
193.3 in 2011. At nonprofit 4-year institutions, the
number of referrals for these types of incidents rose
from 275.5 per 10,000 students to 341.2 per 10,000
students. About 80 percent of these referrals for
disciplinary actions at public 4-year and nonprofit
4-year institutions were for liquor law violations.

1A school-associated violent death is defined as “a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention
(involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a
functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States,” while the victim was on
the way to or from regular sessions at school, or while the victim was attending or traveling
to or from an official school-sponsored event.
2“At school” includes on school property, on the way to or from regular sessions at school,
and while attending or traveling to or from a school-sponsored event.
3Total youth suicides are reported for calendar years 1992 through 2010 (instead of school
years 1992–93 through 2010–11).
4Data from 1999–2000 onward are subject to change until interviews with school and law
enforcement officials have been completed. The details learned during the interviews can
occasionally change the classification of a case.

†Not applicable.
!Interpret data with caution. Estimate based on 10 or fewer sample cases, or the coefficient of variation is greater than 50 percent.
‡Reporting standards not met. There are too few cases for a reliable estimate.
1Serious violent victimization is also included under all violent victimization.
2“At school” includes inside the school building, on school property, or on the way to and from school.
3Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians/Alaska Natives,
and persons of two or more races.
4Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”

NOTE: “Serious violent victimization” includes the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. “All violent victimization” includes serious violent crimes as well as simple assault. “Theft” includes attempted and completed purse-snatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery,
which involves the threat or use of force and is classified as a violent crime. “Total victimization” includes theft and violent crimes. Data
in this table are from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS); due to differences in time coverage and administration between
the NCVS and the School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the NCVS, data in this table cannot be compared with data in tables that are
based on the SCS. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and missing data on student characteristics. The population size
for students ages 12–18 was 26,052,400 in 2012.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30
and 50 percent.
‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the
coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indians/
Alaska Natives, Asians (prior to 2005), Pacific Islanders, and, from 2003 onward, persons
reporting that they are of two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.
2Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an
MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”

3Serious violent victimization is also included in violent victimization.
NOTE: “Total victimization” includes theft and violent victimization. A single student could
report more than one type of victimization. In the total victimization rows, students who
reported both theft and violent victimization are counted only once. “Theft” includes
attempted and completed purse-snatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and
completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery,
which involves the threat or use of force and is classified as a violent crime. “Serious violent
victimization” includes the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.
“Violent victimization” includes the serious violent crimes as well as simple assault. “At
school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001
onward, going to and from school.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent.
‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.

2Before

1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students were not given the
option of choosing two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing
data on race from 1993, 1995, and 1997 with data from later years.
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. “Weapon” was defined as a gun, knife, or club for survey
respondents. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent.
1Teachers were classified as elementary or secondary on the basis of the grades they taught, rather than on the level of the
school in which they taught. In general, elementary teachers include those teaching prekindergarten through grade 5 and those
teaching multiple grades, with a preponderance of grades taught being kindergarten through grade 6. In general, secondary
teachers include those teaching any of grades 7 through 12 and those teaching multiple grades, with a preponderance of grades
taught being grades 7 through 12 and usually with no grade taught being lower than grade 5.
2Includes American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asians, and Pacific Islanders; for 2003–04 and later years, also includes persons of
two or more races.
3Includes traditional public and public charter schools.

NOTE: Teachers who taught only prekindergarten students are excluded. Instructional level divides teachers into elementary or
secondary based on a combination of the grades taught, main teaching assignment, and the structure of the teachers’ class(es).
Please see the glossary for a more detailed definition. Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Please see the
glossary for a more detailed definition. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Some data have been revised from
previously published figures.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent.
1Theft/larceny (taking things worth over $10 without personal confrontation) was defined for respondents as “the unlawful taking of another
person’s property without personal confrontation, threat, violence, or bodily harm.” This includes pocket picking, stealing a purse or backpack (if left unattended or no force was used to take it from owner), theft from a building, theft from a motor vehicle or motor vehicle parts
or accessories, theft of a bicycle, theft from a vending machine, and all other types of thefts.
2Caution should be used when making direct comparisons of “Other incidents” between years because the survey questions about alcohol and drugs changed, as outlined in footnotes 3, 4, and 5.
3The survey items “Distribution of illegal drugs” and “Possession or use of alcohol or illegal drugs” appear only on the 1999–2000 and
2003–04 questionnaires. Different alcohol- and drug-related survey items were used on the questionnaires for later years.

4The

survey items “Distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs” and “Distribution, possession, or use of alcohol” appear only on the
questionnaires for 2005–06 and later years.
2009–10 questionnaire was the first to include the survey item “Inappropriate distribution, possession, or use of prescription drugs.”
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At
school” was defined to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold
school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, and after normal
school hours or when school activities or events were in session. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and because schools
that recorded or reported more than one type of crime incident were counted only once in the total percentage of schools recording or
reporting incidents.

than grade 8. Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not
higher than grade 9. High schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest grade
is not higher than grade 12. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades, including K–12 schools.
6Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of full-timeequivalent (FTE) teachers. Information regarding the total number of FTE teachers was obtained from the Common Core of Data
(CCD), the sampling frame for SSOCS.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school.
“At school” was defined to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that
hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent.
1All violent incidents include serious violent incidents (see footnote 2) as well as physical attack or fight without a weapon and
threat of physical attack without a weapon.
2Serious violent incidents include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon, threat of physical
attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon.
3Theft/larceny (taking things worth over $10 without personal confrontation) was defined for respondents as “the unlawful taking of
another person’s property without personal confrontation, threat, violence, or bodily harm.” This includes pocket picking, stealing a
purse or backpack (if left unattended or no force was used to take it from owner), theft from a building, theft from a motor vehicle or
motor vehicle parts or accessories, theft of a bicycle, theft from a vending machine, and all other types of thefts.
4“Other incidents” include possession of a firearm or explosive device; possession of a knife or sharp object; distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol; inappropriate distribution, possession, or use of prescription drugs; and vandalism.
5Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher
than grade 8. Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is

not higher than grade 9. High schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest
grade is not higher than grade 12. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades, including K–12 schools.
6Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of fulltime-equivalent (FTE) teachers. Information regarding the total number of FTE teachers was obtained from the Common Core of
Data (CCD), the sampling frame for SSOCS.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school.
“At school” was defined to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places
that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or
after normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

Data (CCD), the sampling frame for SSOCS.
NOTE: Violent incidents include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, threat of
physical attack with or without a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon. Responses were provided by the principal or
the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At school” was defined to include activities that
happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities.
Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school hours or when school
activities or events were in session. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

1Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher
than grade 8. Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is
not higher than grade 9. High schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest
grade is not higher than grade 12. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades, including K–12 schools.
2Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of full-

time-equivalent (FTE) teachers. Information regarding the total number of FTE teachers was obtained from the Common Core of
Data (CCD), the sampling frame for SSOCS.
NOTE: Serious violent incidents include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon, threat of
physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon. Responses were provided by the principal or the person
most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At school” was defined to include activities that happen in
school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school hours or when school activities or
events were in session. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

1Includes schools that reported the activity happens either at least once a week or daily.
2Includes schools that reported the activity happens at all at their school during the school year. In the 1999–2000 survey
administration, the questionnaire specified “undesirable” gang activities and “undesirable” cult or extremist group activities.
3Prior to the 2007–08 survey administration, the questionnaire wording was “student racial tensions.”
4Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not
higher than grade 8. Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. High schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9
and the highest grade is not higher than grade 12. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades, including
K–12 schools.

5Student/teacher

ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of
full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers. Ijnformation regarding the total number of FTE teachers was obtained from the Common
Core of Data (CCD), the sampling frame for SSOCS.
6“Violent incidents” include rape or attempted rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with or without a
weapon, threat of physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the
school. “At school” was defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on
school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to respond only for
those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified otherwise.

1Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asians (prior to
2005), Pacific Islanders, and, from 2003 onward, persons reporting that they are of two or more races. Due to changes in racial/
ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.

in 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period was the previous
6 months. Cognitive testing showed that estimates from 2007 onward are comparable to previous years.
NOTE: Urbanicity refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in
2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).” All gangs, whether or not they are involved in violent or illegal activity, are included. “At school”
includes in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and going to and from school.

1Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.
2Before 1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students were not given the option of
choosing two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing data on race
from 1993, 1995, and 1997 with data from later years.

3Refers

to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents.

1Starting in 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period was the previous 6
months. Cognitive testing showed that estimates from 2007 onward are comparable to previous years.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asians (prior to 2005),
Pacific Islanders, and, from 2003 onward, persons reporting that they are of two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.

3Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
NOTE: “At school” includes in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school.
“Hate-related” refers to derogatory terms used by others in reference to students’ personal characteristics.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between

‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the

1Students who indicated that they had been called a hate-related word were asked to
choose the specific characteristics that the hate-related word or words targeted. Students
were allowed to choose more than one characteristic. If a student chose more than one
characteristic, he or she is counted only once in the total percentage of students who
reported being called a hate-related word; therefore, the total is less than the sum of the
students’ individual characteristics.

household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city
of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” “and not MSA (Rural).”
NOTE: “At school” includes in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or
going to and from school. “Hate-related” refers to derogatory terms used by others in reference to students’ personal characteristics. Detail may not sum to totals because of
rounding and because students may have reported being targets of hate-related words
related to more than one student characteristic.

the incident.
2Students who reported that they were both bullied at school and cyber-bullied anywhere were counted only once in the total for
students bullied at school or cyber-bullied anywhere.
3Students who reported experiencing more than one type of bullying at school were counted only once in the total for students
bullied at school.

Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA
(Rural).” These data by metropolitan status were based on the location of households and differ from those published in Student

National Crime Victimization Survey.
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. Bullying types
do not sum to totals because students could have experienced more than one type of bullying.

‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1Students who reported being cyber-bullied are those who responded that another student had done one or more of the following: posted hurtful information about them on the Internet; purposely shared private information about them on the Internet;
threatened or insulted them through instant messaging; threatened or insulted them through text messaging; threatened or
insulted them through e-mail; threatened or insulted them while gaming; or excluded them online.
2Teacher or other adult at school notified.
3Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indians/Alaska Natives, Pacific Islanders,
and persons reporting that they are of two or more races.

4Refers

to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent's household as defined in 2000 by the U.S.
Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA
(Rural).” These data by metropolitan status were based on the location of households and differ from those published in Student
Reports of Bullying and Cyber-Bullying: Results from the 2011 School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization
Survey, which were based on the urban-centric measure of the location of the school that the child attended.
5Control of school as reported by the respondent. These data differ from those based on a matching of the respondent-reported
school name to the Common Core of Data's Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey or the Private School Survey, as reported in Student Reports of Bullying and Cyber-Bullying: Results from the 2011 School Crime Supplement to the
National Crime Victimization Survey.
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. Detail may not
sum to totals because of rounding.

NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going
to and from school. Bullying types do not sum to totals because students could have experienced more than one type of bullying.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent.
1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many
times in the past 12 months they had been in a physical fight.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.

3Before

1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students were not given the option of
choosing two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing data on race
from 1993, 1995, and 1997 with data from later years.
4Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
5In the question asking students about physical fights at school, “on school property” was not defined for survey respondents.

1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many times in the past 12 months they had been in a physical fight.
2In the question asking students about physical fights at school, “on school property” was not
defined for survey respondents.
3Data include both public and private schools.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent.
1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many
days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.
3Before 1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students were not given the option of
choosing two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing data on race

from 1993, 1995, and 1997 with data from later years.
4Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
5In the question asking students about carrying a weapon at school, “on school property” was not defined for survey respondents.
NOTE: Respondents were asked about carrying “a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club.”

not defined for survey respondents.
3Data include both public and private schools.

1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how
many days during the previous 30 days they had at least one drink of alcohol.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.

3Before

1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students were not given the
option of choosing two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing
data on race from 1993, 1995, and 1997 with data from later years.
4Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S.
Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA
(Rural).”
5In the question about drinking alcohol at school, “on school property” was not defined for survey respondents.

coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire;
students were simply asked how many days during the previous 30 days they had at least
one drink of alcohol.

2In the question about drinking alcohol at school, “on school property” was not defined for
survey respondents.
3Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.
NOTE: Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

‡Reporting standards not met. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is 50 percent or greater.
1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many
times during the previous 30 days they had used marijuana.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.

3Before 1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students were not given the option of
choosing two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing data on race
from 1993, 1995, and 1997 with data from later years.
4Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
5In the question about using marijuana at school, “on school property” was not defined for survey respondents.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30
and 50 percent.
‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the
coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1Starting in 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the
reference period was the previous 6 months. Cognitive testing showed that estimates from
2007 onward are comparable to previous years.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indians/
Alaska Natives, Asians (prior to 2005), Pacific Islanders, and, from 2003 onward, persons
reporting that they are of two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.

3Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an
MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and,
from 2001 onward, going to and from school. Students were asked if they “never,” “almost
never,” “sometimes,” or “most of the time” feared that someone would attack or harm them at
school or away from school. Students responding “sometimes” or “most of the time” were
considered fearful. For the 2001 survey only, the wording was changed from “attack or harm”
to “attack or threaten to attack.”

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30

‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the
coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1Starting in 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the
reference period was the previous 6 months. Cognitive testing showed that estimates from
2007 onward are comparable to previous years.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indians/
Alaska Natives, Asians (prior to 2005), Pacific Islanders, and, from 2003 onward, persons
reporting that they are of two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.

3Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an
MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
4Before 2007, students were asked whether they avoided “any extracurricular activities.”
Starting in 2007, the survey wording was changed to “any activities.”
NOTE: Students were asked whether they avoided places or activities because they thought
that someone might attack or harm them. For the 2001 survey only, the wording was changed
from “attack or harm” to “attack or threaten to attack.” Detail may not sum to totals because of
rounding and because a student who reported more than one type of avoidance was counted
only once in the totals.

‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the coefficient of variation (CV) is

1 Prior to 2005–06, the questionnaire wording was simply “a weapon other than a firearm” (instead of “a weapon other
than a firearm or explosive device”).
2 In the 1999–2000 questionnaire, only two items are the same as in questionnaires for later years—the item on physical
attacks or fights and the item on insubordination. There are no comparable 1999–2000 data for serious disciplinary
actions taken in response to the other specific offenses listed in this table, nor for total actions taken in response to all
the listed offenses.
3 Totals for 2009–10 are not comparable to totals for other years, because the 2009–10 questionnaire did not include an
item on insubordination.

not higher than grade 8. Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and
the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. High schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower
than grade 9 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 12. Combined schools include all other combinations of
grades, including K–12 schools.
NOTE: Serious disciplinary actions include out-of-school suspensions lasting 5 or more days, but less than the remainder of the school year; removals with no continuing services for at least the remainder of the school year; and transfers
to specialized schools for disciplinary reasons. Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. Respondents were instructed to respond only for those times that
were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified otherwise. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and because schools that reported serious disciplinary actions in
response to more than one type of offense were counted only once in the total number or percentage of schools.

General Information

School-Associated Violent Deaths Study (SAVD)

The indicators in this report are based on information
drawn from a variety of independent data sources,
including national surveys of students, teachers,
principals, and postsecondary institutions, and
data collection from federal departments and
agencies, including the Bureau of Justice Statistics,
the National Center for Education Statistics, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, and the Office of
Postsecondary Education. Each data source has an
independent sample design, data collection method,
and questionnaire design or is the result of a universe
data collection. Universe data collections include a
census of all known entities in a specific universe
(e.g., all deaths occurring on school property). Readers
should be cautious when comparing data from
different sources. Differences in sampling procedures,
populations, time periods, and question phrasing can
all affect the comparability of results. For example,
some questions from different surveys may appear
the same, but were asked of different populations
of students (e.g., students ages 12–18 or students in
grades 9–12); in different years; about experiences
that occurred within different periods of time (e.g.,
in the past 30 days or during the past 12 months);
or at different locations (e.g., in school or anywhere).

The School-Associated Violent Deaths Study (SAVD)
is an epidemiological study developed by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in conjunction
with the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S.
Department of Justice. SAVD seeks to describe the
epidemiology of school-associated violent deaths,
identify common features of these deaths, estimate
the rate of school-associated violent death in the
United States, and identify potential risk factors for
these deaths. The study includes descriptive data on all
school-associated violent deaths in the United States,
including all homicides, suicides, or legal intervention
in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of
a functioning elementary or secondary school; while
the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions
at such a school; or while attending or on the way to
or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims of
such incidents include nonstudents, as well as students
and staff members. SAVD includes descriptive
information about the school, event, victim(s), and
offender(s). The SAVD study has collected data from
July 1, 1992, through the present.

All comparisons described in this report are
statistically significant at the .05 level. The primary
test procedure used in this report was Student’s t
statistic, which tests the difference between two
sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted
for multiple comparisons. Estimates displayed in the
text, figures, and tables are rounded from original
estimates, not from a series of rounding.
The following is a description of data sources,
accuracy of estimates, and statistical procedures used
in this report.

Appendix A: Technical Notes

SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and
collect data on school-associated violent deaths.
Cases are initially identified through a search of the
LexisNexis newspaper and media database. Then
law enforcement officials are contacted to confirm
the details of the case and to determine if the event
meets the case definition. Once a case is confirmed,
a law enforcement official and a school official are
interviewed regarding details about the school,
event, victim(s), and offender(s). A copy of the
full law enforcement report is also sought for each
case. The information obtained on schools includes
school demographics, attendance/absentee rates,
suspensions/expulsions and mobility, school history
of weapon-carrying incidents, security measures,
violence prevention activities, school response to the
event, and school policies about weapon carrying.
Event information includes the location of injury,
the context of injury (while classes were being held,
during break, etc.), motives for injury, method of
injury, and school and community events happening
around the time period. Information obtained on
victim(s) and offender(s) includes demographics,
circumstances of the event (date/time, alcohol or drug
use, number of persons involved), types and origins of
weapons, criminal history, psychological risk factors,
school-related problems, extracurricular activities,
and family history, including structure and stressors.

One hundred and five school-associated violent deaths
were identified from July 1, 1992, to June 30, 1994
(Kachur et al. 1996). A more recent report from
this data collection identified 253 school-associated
violent deaths between July 1, 1994, and June 30,
1999 (Anderson et al. 2001). Other publications from
this study have described how the number of events
change during the school year (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention 2001), the source of the
firearms used in these events (Reza et al. 2003), and
suicides that were associated with schools (Kauffman
et al. 2004). The most recent publication describes
trends in school-associated homicide from July 1,
1992, to June 30, 2006 (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention 2008). The interviews conducted
on cases between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1999,
achieved a response rate of 97 percent for police
officials and 78 percent for school officials. For several
reasons, all data for years from 1999 to the present
are flagged as preliminary. For some recent data, the
interviews with school and law enforcement officials
to verify case details have not been completed. The
details learned during the interviews can occasionally
change the classification of a case. Also, new cases
may be identified because of the expansion of the
scope of the media files used for case identification.
Sometimes other cases not identified during earlier
data years using the independent case finding efforts
(which focus on nonmedia sources of information)
will be discovered. Also, other cases may occasionally
be identified while the law enforcement and school
interviews are being conducted to verify known cases.

Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR)
Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) are a part
of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). These
reports provide incident-level information on criminal
homicides, including situation type (e.g., number of
victims, number of offenders, and whether offenders
are known); the age, sex, and race of victims and
offenders; weapon used; circumstances of the
incident; and the relationship of the victim to the
offender. The data are provided monthly to FBI

by local law enforcement agencies participating in
the UCR program. The data include murders and
nonnegligent manslaughters in the United States from
January 1980 to December 2011; that is, negligent
manslaughters and justifiable homicides have been
eliminated from the data. Based on law enforcement
agency reports, the FBI estimates that 611,043
murders (including nonnegligent manslaughters) were
committed from 1980 to 2011. Agencies provided
detailed information on 548,455 of these homicide
victims. SHR estimates in this report have been
revised from those in previously published reports.
About 90 percent of homicides are included in the
SHR program. However, adjustments can be made
to the weights to correct for missing victim reports.
Estimates from the SHR program used in this report
were generated by the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS). Weights have been developed to compensate for
the average annual 10 percent of homicides that were
not reported to the SHR data file. The development
of the set of annual weights is a three-step process.
Each year, the FBI’s annual report Crime in the
United States presents a national estimate of murder
victims in the United States, as well as estimates of
the number of murder victims in each of the 50 states
and the District of Columbia. The first stage weight
uses the FBI’s annual estimates of murder victims in
each state and the number of murder victims from
that state found in the annual SHR database.
Specifically, the first stage weight for state S in year
Y is
FBI’s estimate of murder victims in state S(year Y)
Number of murder victims in the SHR file
from state S(year Y)
For complete reporting states, this first stage weight
is equal to 1. For partial reporting states, this weight
is greater than 1. For states with a first stage weight
greater than 2.0000—meaning that the state reported
SHR data for less than half of the FBI’s estimated
number of murder victims in the state—the first stage
weight is set to 1.
The second stage weight uses the FBI’s annual
national estimates of murder victims in the United
States and the sum of the first stage weights for each
state. The second stage weight for all states in year Y is
FBI estimate of murder victims in the U.S.(year Y)
Sum of the first stage weights of all states(year Y)
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2013

163

The third step in the process is to calculate the final
annual SHR weight. The annual SHR weight used
to develop national estimates of the attributes of
murder victims is
SHR weight(year Y) =
(First stage weight(year Y))*Second stage weight(year Y))
Conceptually, the first stage weight uses a state’s
own reported SHR records to represent all murder
victims in that state, as long as at least 50 percent of
the estimated number of murder victims in that state
has an SHR record. The sum of the first stage weights
then equal the sum of (1) the total number of all the
murder victims in states within at least 50 percent
SHR coverage and (2) the simple count of those
victims from the other reporting states. The second
stage weight is then used to inflate the first stage
weights so that the weight derived from the product
of the first and second stage weights represent all
murder victims in that year. The difference between
the sum of the first stage weights and the FBI’s
annual national estimate of murder victims is (1) the
unreported murder victims in states with less than
50 percent SHR coverage and (2) the murder victims
in states that report no data to the SHR Program in
that year. The second stage weight compensates for
this difference by assuming that the attributes of the
nonreported victims are similar to the attributes of
weighted murder victims in that year’s SHR database.
The weighting procedure outlined above assumes that
the characteristics of unreported homicide incidents
are similar to the characteristics of reported incidents.
There is no comprehensive way to assess the validity
of this assumption. There is one exception to this
weighting process. Some states did not report any
data in some years. For example, Florida reported
no incidents to the SHR program for the years 1988
through 2011. The annual national weights, however,
attempt to compensate for those few instances in
which entire states did not report any data. For

Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting
System Fatal (WISQARS™ Fatal)
WISQARS Fatal provides mortality data related to
injury. The mortality data reported in WISQARS
Fatal come from death certificate data reported to
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data
include causes of death reported by attending
physicians, medical examiners, and coroners. It also
includes demographic information about decedents
reported by funeral directors, who obtain that information from family members and other informants.
NCHS collects, compiles, verifies, and prepares these
data for release to the public. The data provide information about what types of injuries are leading causes
of deaths, how common they are, and who they affect.
These data are intended for a broad audience—the
public, the media, public health practitioners and
researchers, and public health officials—to increase
their knowledge of injury.
WISQARS Fatal mortality reports provide tables of
the total numbers of injury-related deaths and the
death rates per 100,000 U.S. population. The reports
list deaths according to cause (mechanism) and intent
(manner) of injury by state, race, Hispanic origin,
sex, and age groupings. For more information on

National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS),
administered for the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS) by the U.S. Census Bureau, is the nation’s
primary source of information on crime and the
victims of crime. Initiated in 1972 and redesigned
in 1992, the NCVS collects detailed information
on the frequency and nature of the crimes of rape,
sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault,
theft, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft
experienced by Americans and American households
each year. The survey measures both crimes reported
to police and crimes not reported to the police.
NCVS estimates reported in Indicators of School
Crime and Safety 2012 and beyond may differ from
those in previous published reports. This is because

a small number of victimizations, referred to as series
victimizations, are included in this report using
a new counting strategy. High-frequency repeat
victimizations, or series victimizations, are six or
more similar but separate victimizations that occur
with such frequency that the victim is unable to recall
each individual event or describe each event in detail.
As part of ongoing research efforts associated with
the redesign of the NCVS, BJS investigated ways to
include high-frequency repeat victimizations, or series
victimizations, in estimates of criminal victimization. Including series victimizations results in more
accurate estimates of victimization. BJS has decided
to include series victimizations using the victim’s
estimates of the number of times the victimization
occurred over the past 6 months, capping the number
of victimizations within each series at a maximum of
10. This strategy for counting series victimizations
balances the desire to estimate national rates and
account for the experiences of persons who have been
subjected to repeat victimizations against the desire to
minimize the estimation errors that can occur when
repeat victimizations are reported. Including series
victimizations in national rates results in rather large
increases in the level of violent victimization; however,
trends in violence are generally similar regardless
of whether series victimizations are included. For
more information on the new counting strategy and
supporting research, see Methods for Counting HighFrequency Repeat Victimizations in the National
Crime Victimization Survey at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.

tion Survey (NCVS) that may have affected survey
estimates. Caution should be used when comparing
2006 estimates to estimates of other years. Data from
2007 onward are comparable to earlier years. Analyses
of the 2007 estimates indicate that the program
changes made in 2006 had relatively small effects on
NCVS estimates. For more information on the 2006
NCVS data, see Criminal Victimization, 2006 at
http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv06.pdf, the
technical notes at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/
pdf/cv06tn.pdf, and Criminal Victimization, 2007
at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv07.pdf.

Readers should note that in 2003, in accordance
with changes to the Office of Management and
Budget’s standards for the classification of federal
data on race and ethnicity, the NCVS item on race/
ethnicity was modified. A question on Hispanic
origin is now followed by a new question about race.
The new question about race allows the respondent
to choose more than one race and delineates Asian
as a separate category from Native Hawaiian or
Other Pacific Islander. An analysis conducted by the
Demographic Surveys Division at the U.S. Census
Bureau showed that the new race question had very
little impact on the aggregate racial distribution of
NCVS respondents, with one exception: There was
a 1.6 percentage point decrease in the percentage of
respondents who reported themselves as White. Due
to changes in race/ethnicity categories, comparisons
of race/ethnicity across years should be made with
caution.

The first NCVS interview with a housing unit is
conducted in person. Subsequent interviews are
conducted by telephone, if possible. About 81,000
persons age 12 and older are interviewed each 6
months. Households remain in the sample for 3
years and are interviewed seven times at 6-month
intervals. Since the survey’s inception, the initial
interview at each sample unit has been used only to
bound future interviews to establish a time frame
to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered in these
subsequent interviews. Beginning in 2006, data from
the initial interview have been adjusted to account
for the effects of bounding and have been included
in the survey estimates. After a household has been
interviewed its seventh time, it is replaced by a new
sample household. The NCVS has consistently
obtained a response rate of around 90 percent at the
household level. The completion rates for persons
within households in 2012 were about 87 percent.
Weights were developed to permit estimates for the
total U.S. population 12 years and older. For more
information about the NCVS, contact:

There were changes in the sample design and survey
methodology in the 2006 National Crime Victimiza-

The number of NCVS-eligible households in the
sample in 2012 was about 107,000. Households
were selected using a stratified, multistage cluster
design. In the first stage, the primary sampling units
(PSUs), consisting of counties or groups of counties,
were selected. In the second stage, smaller areas,
called Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected
from each sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs,
clusters of four households, called segments, were
selected for interview. At each stage, the selection
was done proportionate to population size in order to
create a self-weighting sample. The final sample was
augmented to account for households constructed
after the decennial Census. Within each sampled
household, the U.S. Census Bureau interviewer
attempts to interview all household members age
12 and older to determine whether they had been
victimized by the measured crimes during the 6
months preceding the interview.

School Crime Supplement (SCS)
Created as a supplement to the NCVS and codesigned by the National Center for Education
Statistics and Bureau of Justice Statistics, the School
Crime Supplement (SCS) survey has been conducted
in 1989, 1995, and biennially since 1999 to collect
additional information about school-related victimizations on a national level. This report includes data
from the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009,
and 2011 collections. The 1989 data are not included
in this report as a result of methodological changes to
the NCVS and SCS. The SCS was designed to assist
policymakers, as well as academic researchers and
practitioners at federal, state, and local levels, to make
informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The
survey asks students a number of key questions about
their experiences with and perceptions of crime and
violence that occurred inside their school, on school
grounds, on the school bus, or on the way to or from
school. Students are asked additional questions about
security measures used by their school, students’
participation in after school activities, students’
perceptions of school rules, the presence of weapons
and gangs in school, the presence of hate-related
words and graffiti in school, student reports of
bullying and reports of rejection at school, and the
availability of drugs and alcohol in school. Students
are also asked attitudinal questions relating to fear
of victimization and avoidance behavior at school.
The SCS survey was conducted for a 6-month period
from January through June in all households selected
for the NCVS (see discussion above for information
about the NCVS sampling design and changes to the
race/ethnicity variable beginning in 2003). Within
these households, the eligible respondents for the SCS
were those household members who had attended
school at any time during the 6 months preceding
the interview, were enrolled in grades 6–12, and were
not home schooled. In 2007, the questionnaire was
changed and household members who attended school
sometime during the school year of the interview were
included. The age range of students covered in this
report is 12–18 years of age. Eligible respondents were
asked the supplemental questions in the SCS only after
completing their entire NCVS interview. It should be
noted that the first or unbounded NCVS interview
has always been included in analysis of the SCS data
and may result in the reporting of events outside of
the requested reference period.

Appendix A: Technical Notes

The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999, 2001,
2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011 was calculated by
using NCVS incident variables appended to the SCS
data files of the same year. The NCVS type of crime
variable was used to classify victimizations of students
in the SCS as serious violent, violent, or theft. The
NCVS variables asking where the incident happened
(at school) and what the victim was doing when it
happened (attending school or on the way to or from
school) were used to ascertain whether the incident
happened at school. Only incidents that occurred
inside the United States are included.
In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modified
from previous collections. First, in 1995 and 1999, “at
school” was defined for respondents as in the school
building, on the school grounds, or on a school bus.
In 2001, the definition for “at school” was changed
to mean in the school building, on school property,
on a school bus, or going to and from school. This
change was made to the 2001 questionnaire in order
to be consistent with the definition of “at school” as it
is constructed in the NCVS and was also used as the
definition in subsequent SCS collections. Cognitive
interviews conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on
the 1999 SCS suggested that modifications to the
definition of “at school” would not have a substantial
impact on the estimates.
A total of about 9,700 students participated in the
1995 SCS, 8,400 in 1999, 8,400 in 2001, 7,200 in
2003, 6,300 in 2005, 5,600 in 2007, 5,000 in 2009,
and 6,500 in 2011. In the 2011 SCS, the household
completion rate was 91 percent.
In the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, and
2009 SCS, the household completion rates were
95 percent, 94 percent, 93 percent, 92 percent, 91
percent, 90 percent, and 92 percent respectively,
and the student completion rates were 78 percent,
78 percent, 77 percent, 70 percent, 62 percent, 58
percent, and 56 percent respectively. For the 2011
SCS, the student completion rate was 63 percent. The
overall unweighted SCS unit response rate (calculated
by multiplying the household completion rate by
the student completion rate) was about 74 percent
in 1995, 73 percent in 1999, 72 percent in 2001, 64
percent in 2003, 56 percent in 2005, 53 percent in
2007, 51 percent in 2009, and 57 percent in 2011.
There are two types of nonresponse: unit and
item nonresponse. NCES requires that any stage
of data collection within a survey that has a unit
base-weighted response rate of less than 85 percent
be evaluated for the potential magnitude of unit
nonresponse bias before the data or any analysis
using the data may be released (U.S. Department of

Education 2003). Due to the low unit response rate
in 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011, a unit nonresponse
bias analysis was done. Unit response rates indicate
how many sampled units have completed interviews.
Because interviews with students could only be
completed after households had responded to the
NCVS, the unit completion rate for the SCS reflects
both the household interview completion rate and
the student interview completion rate. Nonresponse
can greatly affect the strength and application of
survey data by leading to an increase in variance as a
result of a reduction in the actual size of the sample
and can produce bias if the nonrespondents have
characteristics of interest that are different from the
respondents.
In order for response bias to occur, respondents
must have different response rates and responses to
particular survey variables. The magnitude of unit
nonresponse bias is determined by the response
rate and the differences between respondents and
nonrespondents on key survey variables. Although the
bias analysis cannot measure response bias since the
SCS is a sample survey and it is not known how the
population would have responded, the SCS sampling
frame has four key student or school characteristic
variables for which data is known for respondents
and nonrespondents: sex, race/ethnicity, household
income, and urbanicity, all of which are associated
with student victimization. To the extent that there
are differential responses by respondents in these
groups, nonresponse bias is a concern.
In 2005, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of bias for the race, household income, and
urbanicity variables. White (non-Hispanic) and Other
(non-Hispanic) respondents had higher response
rates than Black (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic
respondents. Respondents from households with an
income of $35,000–$49,999 and $50,000 or more
had higher response rates than those from households
with incomes of less than $7,500, $7,500–$14,999,
$15,000–$24,999 and $25,000–$34,999. Respondents who live in urban areas had lower response
rates than those who live in rural or suburban areas.
Although the extent of nonresponse bias cannot be
determined, weighting adjustments, which corrected
for differential response rates, should have reduced
the problem.
In 2007, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of bias by the race/ethnicity and household
income variables. Hispanic respondents had lower
response rates than other race/ethnicities.

Respondents from households with an income of
$25,000 or more had higher response rates than those
from households with incomes of less than $25,000.
However, when responding students are compared to
the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable
differences between the responding students and the
eligible students, suggesting the nonresponse bias has
little impact on the overall estimates.
In 2009, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of potential bias for the race/ethnicity and
urbanicity variables. White students and students of
other race/ethnicities had higher response rates than
did Black and Hispanic respondents. Respondents
from households located in rural areas had higher
response rates than those from households located in
urban areas. However, when responding students are
compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were
no measurable differences between the responding
students and the eligible students, suggesting the
nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall
estimates.
In 2011, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of potential bias for the age variable.
Respondents 12 to 17 years old had higher response
rates than did 18 year old respondents in the NCVS
and SCS interviews. Weighting the data adjusts for
unequal selection probabilities and for the effects of
nonresponse. The weighting adjustments that correct
for differential response rates are created by region,
age, race, and sex, and should have reduced the effect
of nonresponse.
Response rates for most SCS survey items in all
survey years were high—typically over 97 percent
of all eligible respondents meaning there is little
potential for item nonresponse bias for most items in
the survey. Weights were developed to compensate for
differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse.
The weighted data permit inferences about the eligible
student population who were enrolled in schools in
all SCS data years. For more information about SCS,

Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)
The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System
(YRBSS) is an epidemiological surveillance system
developed by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) to monitor the prevalence of youth
behaviors that most influence health. The YRBSS
focuses on priority health-risk behaviors established
during youth that result in the most significant
mortality, morbidity, disability, and social problems
during both youth and adulthood. The YRBSS
includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior
Survey (YRBS) as well as surveys conducted in states
and large urban school districts. This report uses
1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007,
2009, and 2011 YRBSS data.
The national YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling
design to produce a nationally representative sample
of students in grades 9–12 in the United States.
The target population consisted of all public and
private school students in grades 9–12 in the 50
states and the District of Columbia. The first-stage
sampling frame included selecting primary sampling
units (PSUs) from strata formed on the basis of
urbanization and the relative percentage of Black
and Hispanic students in the PSU. These PSUs are
either counties; subareas of large counties; or groups
of smaller, adjacent counties. At the second stage,
schools were selected with probability proportional
to school enrollment size.
The final stage of sampling consisted of randomly
selecting, in each chosen school and in each of
grades 9–12, one or two classrooms from either a
required subject, such as English or social studies,
or a required period, such as homeroom or second
period. All students in selected classes were eligible
to participate. Three strategies were used to oversample
Black and Hispanic students: (1) larger sampling rates
were used to select PSUs that are in high-Black and
high-Hispanic strata; (2) a modified measure of size
was used that increased the probability of selecting
schools with a disproportionately high minority
enrollment; and (3) two classes per grade, rather than
one, were selected in schools with a high percentage
of combined Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander,
or American Indian/Alaska Native enrollment.
Approximately 16,300 students participated in

survey, 16,400 students participated in the 2009
survey, and 15,400 participated in the 2011 survey.
The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993
survey, 60 percent for the 1995 survey, 69 percent
for the 1997 survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey,
63 percent for the 2001 survey, 67 percent for the
2003 survey, 67 percent for the 2005 survey, 68
percent for the 2007 survey, 71 percent for the 2009
survey, and 71 percent for the 2011 survey. NCES
standards call for response rates of 85 percent or
better for cross-sectional surveys, and bias analyses
are required by NCES when that percentage is not
achieved. For YRBS data, a full nonresponse bias
analysis has not been done because the data necessary
to do the analysis are not available. The weights
were developed to adjust for nonresponse and the
oversampling of Black and Hispanic students in the
sample. The final weights were constructed so that
only weighted proportions of students (not weighted
counts of students) in each grade matched national
population projections.
State-level data were downloaded from the Youth
Online: Comprehensive Results web page (http://
apps.nccd.cdc.gov/youthonline/App/Default.aspx).
Each state and district school-based YRBS employs
a two-stage, cluster sample design to produce
representative samples of students in grades 9–12
in their jurisdiction. All except a few state samples,
and all district samples, include only public schools,
and each district sample includes only schools in the
funded school district (e.g., San Diego Unified School
District) rather than in the entire city (e.g., greater
San Diego area).
In the first sampling stage in all except a few states
and districts, schools are selected with probability
proportional to school enrollment size. In the second
sampling stage, intact classes of a required subject
or intact classes during a required period (e.g.,
second period) are selected randomly. All students
in sampled classes are eligible to participate. Certain
states and districts modify these procedures to meet
their individual needs. For example, in a given
state or district, all schools, rather than a sample
of schools, might be selected to participate. State
and local surveys that have a scientifically selected
sample, appropriate documentation, and an overall
response rate greater than or equal to 60 percent are
weighted. The overall response rate reflects the school
response rate multiplied by the student response rate.
These three criteria are used to ensure that the data
from those surveys can be considered representative
of students in grades 9–12 in that jurisdiction. A
weight is applied to each record to adjust for student

nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade,
sex, and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore,
weighted estimates are representative of all students
in grades 9–12 attending schools in each jurisdiction.
Surveys that do not have an overall response rate of
greater than or equal to 60 percent and that do not
have appropriate documentation are not weighted and
are not included in this report.
In 2011, a total of 43 states and 21 districts had
weighted data. Not all of the districts were contained
in the 43 states. For example, California was not
one of the 43 states that obtained weighted data
but it contained several districts that did. For more
information on the location of the districts please see
http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/participation.
htm. In sites with weighted data, the student sample
sizes for the state and district YRBS ranged from
1,103 to 13,201. School response rates ranged from
73 to 100 percent, student response rates ranged from
60 to 88 percent, and overall response rates ranged
from 60 to 86 percent.
Readers should note that reports of these data
published by the CDC and in this report do not
include percentages where the denominator includes
less than 100 unweighted cases.
In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office
of Management and Budget’s standards for the
classification of federal data on race and ethnicity,
the YRBS item on race/ethnicity was modified. The
version of the race and ethnicity question used in
1993, 1995, and 1997 was:
How do you describe yourself?
a.	 White—not Hispanic
b.	 Black—not Hispanic
c. Hispanic or Latino
d. Asian or Pacific Islander
e. American Indian or Alaskan Native
f.	Other
The version used in 1999, 2001, 2003, and in the
2005, 2007, and 2009 state and local district surveys
was:
How do you describe yourself? (Select one or more
responses.)
a. American Indian or Alaska Native
b.	Asian
c. Black or African American
d. Hispanic or Latino

e. Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
f.	White
In the 2005 national survey and in all 2007, 2009,
and 2011 surveys, race/ethnicity was computed from
two questions: (1) “Are you Hispanic or Latino?”
(response options were “yes” and “no”), and (2) “What
is your race?” (response options were “American
Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian,” “Black or African
American,” “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific
Islander,” or “White”). For the second question,
students could select more than one response option.
For this report, students were classified as “Hispanic”
if they answered “yes” to the first question, regardless
of how they answered the second question. Students
who answered “no” to the first question and selected
more than one race/ethnicity in the second category
were classified as “More than one race.” Students
who answered “no” to the first question and selected
only one race/ethnicity were classified as that race/
ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was classified as missing for
students who did not answer the first question and
for students who answered “no” to the first question
but did not answer the second question.
CDC has conducted two studies to understand the
effect of changing the race/ethnicity item on the
YRBS. Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found
that allowing students to select more than one
response to a single race/ethnicity question on the
YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/
ethnicity among high school students. Eaton, Brener,
Kann, and Pittman (2007) found that self-reported
race/ethnicity was similar regardless of whether
the single-question or a two-question format was
used. For additional information about the YRBSS,

Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS)
The Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) is a set of
related questionnaires that collect descriptive data
on the context of public and private elementary and

169

secondary education. Data reported by districts,
schools, principals, and teachers provide a variety of
statistics on the condition of education in the United
States that may be used by policy makers and the
general public. The SASS system covers a wide range of
topics, including teacher demand, teacher and principal
characteristics, teachers’ and principals’ perceptions of
school climate and problems in their schools, teacher
and principal compensation, district hiring and retention practices, general conditions in schools, and basic
characteristics of the student population.
SASS data are collected through a mail questionnaire
with telephone and in-person field follow-up. SASS
has been conducted by the Census Bureau for NCES
since the first administration of the survey, which
was conducted during the 1987–88 school year.
Subsequent SASS administrations were conducted in
1990–91, 1993–94, 1999–2000, 2003–04, 2007–08,
and 2011–12.
SASS is designed to produce national, regional, and
state estimates for public elementary and secondary
schools, school districts, principals, teachers, and
school library media centers; and national and
regional estimates for public charter schools, as well as
principals, teachers, and school library media centers
within these schools. For private schools, the sample
supports national, regional, and affiliation estimates
for schools, principals, and teachers.
From its inception, SASS has had four core components: school questionnaires, teacher questionnaires,
principal questionnaires, and school district (prior
to 1999–2000, “teacher demand and shortage”)
questionnaires. A fifth component, school library
media center questionnaires, was introduced in the
1993–94 administration and has been included in
every subsequent administration of SASS. School
library data were also collected in the 1990–91
administration of the survey through the school and
principal questionnaires.

170

survey has changed to accommodate emerging issues
in elementary and secondary education. Some items
have been added, some have been deleted, and some
questionnaire items have been reworded.
During the 1990–91 SASS cycle, NCES worked
with the Office of Indian Education to add an Indian
School Questionnaire to SASS, and it remained a
part of SASS through 2007–08. The Indian School
Questionnaire explores the same school-level issues
that the Public and Private School Questionnaires
explore, allowing comparisons among the three types
of schools. The 1990–91, 1993–94, 1999–2000,
2003–04, and 2007–08 administrations of SASS
obtained data on Bureau of Indian Education (BIE)
schools (schools funded or operated by the BIE), but
the 2011–12 administration did not obtain BIE data.
SASS estimates for all survey years presented in this
report exclude BIE schools, and as a result, estimates
in this report may differ from those in previously
published reports.
School library media center questionnaires were
administered in public, private, and BIE schools as
part of the 1993–1994 and 1999–2000 SASS. During
the 2003–04 administration of SASS, only library
media centers in public schools were surveyed, and
in 2007–08 library media centers in public schools
and BIE and BIE-funded schools. The 2011–12 survey
collected data only on school library media centers
in traditional public schools and in public charter
schools. School library questions focused on facilities,
services and policies, staffing, technology, information literacy, collections and expenditures, and media
equipment. New or revised topics included access
to online licensed databases, resource availability,
and additional elements on information literacy.
The Student Records and Library Media Specialist/
Librarian Questionnaires were administered only in
1993–94.

School questionnaires used in SASS include the
Public and Private School Questionnaires; teacher
questionnaires include the Public and Private School
Teacher Questionnaires; principal questionnaires
include the Public and Private School Principal (or
School Administrator) Questionnaires, and school
district questionnaires include the School District
(or Teacher Demand and Shortage) Questionnaires.

As part of the 1999–2000 SASS, the Charter School
Questionnaire was sent to the universe of charter
schools in operation in 1998–99. In 2003–04 and
in subsequent administrations of SASS, charter
schools were included in the public school sample
as opposed to being sent a separate questionnaire.
Another change in the 2003–04 administration of
SASS was a revised data collection procedure using a
primary in-person contact within the school intended
to reduce the field follow-up phase.

Although the four core questionnaires and the school
library media questionnaires have remained relatively
stable over the various administrations of SASS, the

The SASS teacher surveys collect information
on the characteristics of teachers, such as their
age, race/ethnicity, years of teaching experience,

Appendix A: Technical Notes

average number of hours per week spent on
teaching activities, base salary, average class size,
and highest degree earned. These teacher-reported
data may be combined with related information on
their school’s characteristics, such as school type
(e.g., public traditional, public charter, Catholic,
private other religious, and private nonsectarian),
community type, and school enrollment size. The
teacher questionnaires also ask for information on
teacher opinions regarding the school and teaching
environment. In 1993–94, about 53,000 public
school teachers and 10,400 private school teachers
were sampled. In 1999–2000, about 56,300 public
school teachers, 4,400 public charter school teachers,
and 10,800 private school teachers were sampled.
In 2003–04, about 52,500 public school teachers
and 10,000 private school teachers were sampled.
In 2007–08, about 48,400 public school teachers
and 8,200 private school teachers were sampled.
In 2011–12, about 51,100 public school teachers
and 7,100 private school teachers were sampled.
Weighted overall response rates in 2011–12 were 61.8
percent for public school teachers and 50.1 percent
for private school teachers.
The SASS principal surveys focus on such topics as
age, race/ethnicity, sex, average annual salary, years
of experience, highest degree attained, perceived
influence on decisions made at the school, and hours
spent per week on all school activities. These data
on principals can be placed in the context of other
SASS data, such as the type of the principal’s school
(e.g., public traditional, public charter, Catholic,
other religious, or nonsectarian), enrollment, and
percentage of students eligible for free or reduced
price lunch. In 2003–04, about 10,200 public
school principals were sampled, and in 2007–08,
about 9,800 public school principals were sampled.
In 2011–12, about 11,000 public school principals
and 3,000 private school principals were sampled.
Weighted response rates in 2011–12 for public school
principals and private school principals were 72.7
percent and 64.7 percent, respectively.
The SASS 2011–12 sample of schools was confined
to the 50 states and the District of Columbia and
excludes the other jurisdictions, the Department of
Defense overseas schools, the BIE schools, and schools
that do not offer teacher-provided classroom instruction in grades 1–12 or the ungraded equivalent. The
SASS 2011–12 sample included 10,250 traditional
public schools, 750 public charter schools, and 3,000
private schools.

The public school sample for the 2011–12 SASS
was based on an adjusted public school universe
file from the 2009–10 Common Core of Data
(CCD), a database of all the nation’s public school
districts and public schools. The private school
sample for the 2011–12 SASS was selected from the
2009–10 Private School Universe Survey (PSS), as
updated for the 2011–12 PSS. This update collected
membership lists from private school associations
and religious denominations, as well as private
school lists from state education departments. The
2011–12 SASS private school frame was further
augmented by the inclusion of additional schools
that were identified through the 2009–10 PSS area
frame data collection.

School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)
The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)
is managed by the National Center for Education
Statistics (NCES) on behalf of the U.S. Department
of Education. SSOCS collects extensive crime and
safety data from principals and school administrators
of U.S. public schools. Data from this collection can
be used to examine the relationship between school
characteristics and violent and serious violent crimes
in primary schools, middle schools, high schools, and
combined schools. In addition, data from SSOCS can
be used to assess what crime prevention programs,
practices, and policies are used by schools. SSOCS
has been conducted in school years 1999–2000,
2003–04, 2005–06, 2007–08, and 2009–10.

171

SSOCS was developed by NCES and is funded by
the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools of the U.S.
Department of Education. The 2009–10 SSOCS
(SSOCS: 2010) was conducted by the U.S. Census
Bureau. Data collection began on February 24, 2010,
when questionnaire packets were mailed to sampled
schools, and continued through June 11, 2010. A total
of 2,648 public schools submitted usable questionnaires: 684 primary schools, 909 middle schools, 948
high schools, and 107 combined schools.
The sampling frame for SSOCS: 2010 was constructed
from the 2007–08 Public Elementary/Secondary
School Universe data file of the Common Core
of Data (CCD), an annual collection of data on
all public K–12 schools and school districts. The
SSOCS sampling frame was restricted to regular
public schools in the United States and the District
of Columbia (including charter schools).
A total of 3,476 schools were selected for the 2010
study. In February 2010, questionnaires were mailed
to school principals, who were asked to complete the
survey or to have it completed by the person most
knowledgeable about discipline issues at the school.
A total of 2,648 schools completed the survey. The
weighted overall response rate was 80.8 percent.1 A
nonresponse bias analysis was conducted on the 3
items with weighted item nonresponse rates below
85 percent. The detected bias was not deemed
problematic enough to suppress any items from the
data file. A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted
to evaluate the extent of bias for any survey stage
with a base-weighted unit response rate less than
85 percent. Responding and nonresponding schools
were compared across the characteristics available
for both groups: school level, enrollment size, locale,
percent White enrollment, region, number of FTE
teachers, student-to-teacher ratio, and percentage
of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch.
This analysis indicated that there were no measurable
differences between the responding schools and the
full sample of schools, suggesting that nonresponse
bias is not an issue for SSOCS: 2010. Weights were
developed to adjust for the variable probabilities of
selection and differential nonresponse and can be
used to produce national estimates for regular public
schools in the 2009–10 school year. For information
on the 1999–2000, 2003–04, 2005–06, 2007–08,
and 2009–10 iterations, see Neiman (2011). For more

Safety, contact:

base sampling rates to the following ratio: completed cases/

Campus Safety and Security Survey
Since 1990, all postsecondary institutions participating in Title IV student financial aid programs
have been required to comply with the Jeanne Clery
Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus
Crime Statistics Act, known as the Clery Act. Originally, Congress enacted the Crime Awareness and
Campus Security Act, which was amended in 1992,
1998, and again in 2000. The 1998 amendments
renamed the law the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of
Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics
Act. The Clery Act requires schools to give timely
warnings of crimes to the student body and staff; to
publicize campus crime and safety policies; and to
collect, report, and disseminate campus crime data.
Crime statistics are collected and disseminated by
campus security authorities. These authorities include
campus police; non-police security staff responsible for
monitoring campus property; municipal, county, or state
law enforcement agencies with institutional agreements
for security services; individuals and offices designated
by the campus security policies as those to whom crimes
should be reported; and officials of the institution with
significant responsibility for student and campus activities. The act requires disclosure for offenses committed at
geographic locations associated with each institution. For
on-campus crimes, this includes property and buildings
owned or controlled by the institution. In addition to
on-campus crimes, the act requires disclosure of crimes
committed in or on a non-campus building or property
owned or controlled by the institution for educational
purposes or for recognized student organizations, and
on public property within or immediately adjacent to
and accessible from the campus.
There are three types of statistics described in this
report: criminal offenses; arrests for illegal weapons
possession and violation of drug and liquor laws; and
disciplinary referrals for illegal weapons possession and
violation of drug and liquor laws. Criminal offenses
include homicide, sex offenses, robbery, aggravated
assaults, burglary, motor vehicle theft, and arson. Only
the most serious offense is counted when more than
one offense was committed during an incident. The two

other categories, arrests and referrals, include counts for
illegal weapons possession and violation of drug and
liquor laws. Arrests and referrals relate to only those
that are in violation of the law and not just in violation
of institutional policies. If no federal, state, or local law
was violated, these events are not reported. Further, if
an individual is arrested and referred for disciplinary
action for an offense, only the arrest is counted. Arrest
is defined to include persons processed by arrest,
citation, or summons, including those arrested and
released without formal charges being placed. Referral
for disciplinary action is defined to include persons
referred to any official who initiates a disciplinary action
of which a record is kept and which may result in the
imposition of a sanction. Referrals may or may not
involve the police or other law enforcement agencies.
All criminal offenses and arrests may include students,
faculty, staff, and the general public. These offenses
may or may not involve students that are enrolled in
the institution. Referrals primarily deal with persons
associated formally with the institution (i.e., students,
faculty, staff).
Campus security and police statistics do not necessarily
reflect the total amount or even the nature of crime
on campus. Rather, they reflect incidents that have
been reported and recorded by campus security and/
or local police. The process of reporting and recording
alleged criminal incidents involve some well-known
social filters and steps beginning with the victim. First,
the victim or some other party must recognize that a
possible crime has occurred and report the event. The
event must then be recorded, and if it is recorded, the
nature and type of offense must be classified. This
classification may differ from the initial report due to
the collection of additional evidence, interviews with
witnesses, or through officer discretion. Also, the date
an incident is reported may be much later than the
date of the actual incident. For example, a victim may
not realize something was stolen until much later or a
victim of violence may wait a number of days to report
a crime. Other factors are related to the probability
that an incident is reported, including the severity of
the event, the victim’s confidence and prior experience
with the police or security agency, or influence from
third parties (e.g., friends and family knowledgeable
about the incident). Finally the reader should be
mindful that these figures represent alleged criminal
offenses reported to campus security and/or local
police within a given year, and they do not necessarily
reflect prosecutions or convictions for crime. More
information on the reporting of campus crime and
safety data may be obtained from: The Handbook for
Campus Safety and Security Reporting http://www2.

Accuracy of Estimates
The accuracy of any statistic is determined by the joint
effects of nonsampling and sampling errors. Both
types of error affect the estimates presented in this
report. Several sources can contribute to nonsampling
errors. For example, members of the population of
interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling
frame; sampled members refuse to answer some of
the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of the
survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse); mistakes
are made during data editing, coding, or entry; the
responses that respondents provide differ from the “true”
responses; or measurement instruments such as tests or
questionnaires fail to measure the characteristics they are
intended to measure. Although nonsampling errors due
to questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced
somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and
imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors
or gauging the effects of these errors is usually difficult.
Sampling errors occur because observations are
made on samples rather than on entire populations.
Surveys of population universes are not subject to
sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample will differ
somewhat from those that would have been obtained
by a complete census of the relevant population using
the same survey instruments, instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a measure of
the variation due to sampling; it indicates the precision
of the statistic obtained in a particular sample. In
addition, the standard errors for two sample statistics
can be used to estimate the precision of the difference
between the two statistics and to help determine
whether the difference based on the sample is large
enough so that it represents the population difference.
Most of the data used in this report were obtained from
complex sampling designs rather than a simple random
design. The features of complex sampling require different
techniques to calculate standard errors than are used for
data collected using a simple random sampling. Therefore,
calculation of standard errors requires procedures that
are markedly different from the ones used when the
data are from a simple random sample. The Taylor
series approximation technique or the balanced repeated
replication (BRR) method was used to estimate most
of the statistics and their standard errors in this report.

173

Standard error calculation for data from the School
Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series
approximation method using PSU and strata variables
available from each dataset. For statistics based on
all years of NCVS data, standard errors were derived
from a formula developed by the U.S. Census Bureau,
which consists of three generalized variance function
(gvf) constant parameters that represent the curve
fitted to the individual standard errors calculated
using the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique.
The coefficient of variation (CV ) represents the ratio
of the standard error to the mean. As an attribute
of a distribution, the CV is an important measure of
the reliability and accuracy of an estimate. With the
exception of Indicator 2, the CV was calculated for
all estimates in this report, and in cases where the CV
was between 30 and 50 percent the estimates were
noted with a ! symbol (interpret data with caution).
In Indicator 2, the “!” symbol cautions the reader that
estimates marked indicate that the reported statistic
was based on fewer than 10 cases. With the exception
of Indicator 2, in cases where the CV was 50 percent
or greater, the estimate was determined not to meet
reporting standards and was suppressed.

Statistical Procedures
The comparisons in the text have been tested for
statistical significance to ensure that the differences
are larger than might be expected due to sampling
variation. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited
in the report are statistically significant at the .05 level.
Several test procedures were used, depending upon
the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the
statement being tested. The primary test procedure
used in this report was Student’s t statistic, which tests
the difference between two sample estimates. The t test
formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. The
formula used to compute the t statistic is as follows:

t=

E1 - E2
√se  12

+

	

se  22

(1)

where E1 and E2 are the estimates to be compared
and se1 and se2 are their corresponding standard
errors. Note that this formula is valid only for
independent estimates. When the estimates are not
independent (for example, when comparing a total
percentage with that for a subgroup included in the
total), a covariance term (i.e., 2 * r * se1 * se2) must
be subtracted from the denominator of the formula:

t=

174

E1 - E2
√se  12

+

se  22 -

	

(2 * r * se1 * se2 )

Appendix A: Technical Notes

(2)

where r is the correlation coefficient. Once the t value
was computed, it was compared to the published tables
of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels.
For this report, an alpha value of .05 was used, which
has a t value of 1.96. If the t value was larger than
1.96, then the difference between the two estimates
is statistically significant at the 95 percent level.
A linear trend test was used when differences among
percentages were examined relative to ordered
categories of a variable, rather than the differences
between two discrete categories. This test allows one
to examine whether, for example, the percentage
of students using drugs increased (or decreased)
over time or whether the percentage of students
who reported being physically attacked in school
increased (or decreased) with their age. Based on
a regression with, for example, student’s age as the
independent variable and whether a student was
physically attacked as the dependent variable, the
test involves computing the regression coefficient (b
and its corresponding standard error se). The ratio
of these two (b/se) is the test statistic t. If t is greater
than 1.96, the critical value for one comparison at
the .05 alpha level, the hypothesis that there is no
linear relationship between student’s age and being
physically attacked is rejected.
Some comparisons among categories of an ordered
variable with three or more levels involved a test for a
linear trend across all categories, rather than a series
of tests between pairs of categories. In this report,
when differences among percentages were examined
relative to a variable with ordered categories, analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear
relationship between the two variables. To do
this, ANOVA models included orthogonal linear
contrasts corresponding to successive levels of the
independent variable. The squares of the Taylorized
standard errors (that is, standard errors that were
calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance
between the means, and the unweighted sample
sizes were used to partition the total sum of squares
into within- and between-group sums of squares.
These were used to create mean squares for the
within- and between-group variance components
and their corresponding F statistics, which were then
compared to published values of F for a significance
level of .05. Significant values of both the overall F
and the F associated with the linear contrast term
were required as evidence of a linear relationship
between the two variables.

General Terms
Crime Any violation of a statute or regulation or any
act that the government has determined is injurious
to the public, including felonies and misdemeanors.
Such violation may or may not involve violence, and
it may affect individuals or property.
Incident A specific criminal act or offense involving
one or more victims and one or more offenders.
Multistage sampling A survey sampling technique in
which there is more than one wave of sampling. That
is, one sample of units is drawn, and then another
sample is drawn within that sample. For example,
at the first stage, a number of Census blocks may be
sampled out of all the Census blocks in the United
States. At the second stage, households are sampled
within the previously sampled Census blocks.
Prevalence The percentage of the population directly
affected by crime in a given period. This rate is based
upon specific information elicited directly from the
respondent regarding crimes committed against his
or her person, against his or her property, or against
an individual bearing a unique relationship to him
or her. It is not based upon perceptions and beliefs
about, or reactions to, criminal acts.
School An education institution consisting of one or
more of grades K through 12.
School crime Any criminal activity that is committed
on school property.
School year The 12-month period of time denoting
the beginning and ending dates for school accounting purposes, usually from July 1 through June 30.
Stratification A survey sampling technique in
which the target population is divided into mutually
exclusive groups or strata based on some variable or
variables (e.g., metropolitan area) and sampling of
units occurs separately within each stratum.
Unequal probabilities A survey sampling technique
in which sampled units do not have the same probability of selection into the sample. For example, the
investigator may oversample rural students in order
to increase the sample sizes of rural students. Rural
students would then be more likely than other students to be sampled.

Specific Terms Used in Various Surveys
School-Associated Violent Deaths Study (SAVD)
Homicide An act involving a killing of one person by
another resulting from interpersonal violence.
School-associated violent death A homicide or
suicide in which the fatal injury occurred on the
campus of a functioning elementary or secondary

Appendix B: Glossary of Terms

school in the United States, while the victim was on
the way to or from regular sessions at such a school, or
while the victim was attending or traveling to or from
an official school-sponsored event. Victims included
nonstudents as well as students and staff members.
Suicide An act of taking one’s own life voluntarily
and intentionally.
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
Aggravated assault Attack or attempted attack with
a weapon, regardless of whether or not an injury
occurs, and attack without a weapon when serious
injury results.
At school (students) Inside the school building, on
school property (school parking area, play area, school
bus, etc.), or on the way to or from school.
Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) Geographic
entities defined by the U.S. Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for use by federal statistical
agencies in collecting, tabulating, and publishing
federal statistics.
Rape Forced sexual intercourse including both
psychological coercion as well as physical force.
Forced sexual intercourse means vaginal, anal, or
oral penetration by the offender(s). Includes attempts
and verbal threats of rape. This category also includes
incidents where the penetration is from a foreign
object, such as a bottle.
Robbery Completed or attempted theft, directly
from a person, of property or cash by force or threat
of force, with or without a weapon, and with or
without injury.
Serious violent victimization Rape, sexual assault,
robbery, or aggravated assault.
Sexual assault A wide range of victimizations,
separate from rape or attempted rape. These crimes
include attacks or attempted attacks generally involving unwanted sexual contact between the victim and
offender. Sexual assault may or may not involve force
and includes such things as grabbing or fondling.
Sexual assault also includes verbal threats.
Simple assault Attack without a weapon resulting
either in no injury, minor injury, or an undetermined
injury requiring less than 2 days of hospitalization.
Also includes attempted assault without a weapon.
Theft Completed or attempted theft of property or
cash without personal contact.
Victimization A crime as it affects one individual
person or household. For personal crimes, the number
of victimizations is equal to the number of victims involved. The number of victimizations may be greater

than the number of incidents because more than one
person may be victimized during an incident.
Victimization rate A measure of the occurrence of
victimizations among a specific population group. For
personal crimes, the number of victimizations is equal
to the number of victims involved. Each victimization that is reported by the respondents is counted,
so there may be one incident with two victims, which
would be counted as two victimizations. The number
of victimizations may be greater than the number
of incidents because more than one person may be
victimized during an incident.

any victimization. If the student reported having
experienced both, he or she is counted once under
“total victimization.”
Violent victimization Includes serious violent victimization, rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated
assault, or simple assault.
Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)
Illegal drugs Examples of illegal drugs were marijuana, cocaine, inhalants, steroids, or prescription
drugs without a doctor’s permission, heroin, and
methamphetamines.

Violent victimization Includes serious violent
victimization, rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated
assault, or simple assault.

On school property On school property is included
in the question wording, but was not defined for
respondents.

did not want to do; excluded them from activities
on purpose; or destroyed their property on purpose.
Cyber-bullied Students were asked if another student
did one or more of the following behaviors anywhere

students were asked about bullying by a peer that occurred anywhere via electronic means, including the
Internet, e-mail, instant messaging, text messaging,
online gaming, and online communities.

City A territory inside an urbanized area (defined as
densely settled “cores” with populations of 50,000 or
more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely
settled surrounding areas) and inside a principal
city (defined as a city that contains the primary
population and economic center of a metropolitan
statistical area, which, in turn, is defined as one or
more contiguous counties that have a “core” area with
a large population nucleus and adjacent communities

Elementary teachers See instructional level.
Instructional level Teachers are divided into
elementary or secondary based on a combination
of the grades taught, main teaching assignment,
and the structure of their classes. Those with only
ungraded classes become elementary level teachers
if their main assignment is Early childhood/Pre-k or
Elementary, or they teach either special education in a
self-contained classroom or an elementary enrichment
class. All other teachers with ungraded classes are
classified as secondary level. Among teachers with
regularly graded classes, elementary level teachers
generally teach any of grades Pre-k–5; report an

grades 7–12 but usually no grade lower than 5th. They
also teach more of grades 7–12 than lower level grades.
Rural A territory outside any urbanized area (defined
as densely settled “cores” with populations of 50,000
or more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent
densely settled surrounding areas) or urban cluster
