More than 700,000 young people ages 10 to 24 were treated in emergency departments in 2010 for injuries sustained due to violence. But responding to violence after it happens is only part of the solution. We must prevent youth violence before it begins. In addition, most youth, even those living in high risk situations, are not violent and more must be learned about the factors that are helping youth, protecting them from engaging in violent behavior so that others can benefit. One critical step is a better understanding of the factors that protect youth from engaging in violence. To inform prevention efforts that enhance protective influences, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Center for Injury Prevention and Control convened a panel with expertise in youth development, violence prevention, and analytic methods.This special supplement of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Protective Factors for Youth Violence Perpetration Issues, Evidence, and Public Health Implications*, is the first publication developed from the panel’s work. Its primary purpose is to increase understanding of protective factors for youth violence perpetration by clarifying methods for conceptualizing, measuring, and distinguishing risk and protective effects.***consistently does not listen to adults not sensitive to the feelings of others cruel or violent toward pets or other animals easily frustrated
