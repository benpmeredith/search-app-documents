Executive Summary
Introduction

Key Findings

Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for
teaching and learning, free of crime and violence. Any
instance of crime or violence at school not only affects
the individuals involved, but also may disrupt the
educational process and affect bystanders, the school
itself, and the surrounding community (Henry 2000).

In the 2008–09 school year, an estimated 55.6
million students were enrolled in prekindergarten
through grade 12 (Snyder and Dillow 2010).
Preliminary data show that among youth ages 5–18,
there were 38 school-associated violent deaths1 from
July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2009 (Indicator 1). In
2008, among students ages 12–18, there were about
1.2 million victims of nonfatal crimes at school,2
including 619,000 thefts3 and 629,800 violent crimes4
(simple assault and serious violent crime5) (Indicator
2). In 2009, 8 percent of students reported being
threatened or injured with a weapon, such as a gun,
knife, or club, on school property (Indicator 4). The
following section presents key findings from each
section of the report.

Ensuring safer schools requires establishing good
indicators of the current state of school crime and
safety across the nation and regularly updating
and monitoring these indicators. This is the aim of
Indicators of School Crime and Safety.
This report is the thirteenth in a series of annual
publications produced jointly by the National
Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Institute of
Education Sciences (IES), in the U.S. Department
of Education, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS) in the U.S. Department of Justice. This report
presents the most recent data available on school
crime and student safety. The indicators in this report
are based on information drawn from a variety of
data sources, including national surveys of students,
teachers, and principals. Sources include results from
a study of violent deaths in schools, sponsored by
the U.S. Department of Education and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention; the National
Crime Victimization Survey and School Crime
Supplement to the survey, sponsored by the BJS and
NCES, respectively; the Youth Risk Behavior Survey,
sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention; and the Schools and Staffing Survey and
School Survey on Crime and Safety, both sponsored
by NCES. The most recent data collection for each
indicator varied by survey, from 2007 to 2009. Each
data source has an independent sample design, data
collection method, and questionnaire design, or is the
result of a universe data collection. All comparisons
described in this report are statistically significant at
the .05 level. Additional information about methodology and the datasets analyzed in this report may
be found in appendix A.
This report covers topics such as victimization, teacher
injury, bullying, school conditions, fights, weapons,
availability and student use of drugs and alcohol,
and student perceptions of personal safety at school.
Indicators of crime and safety are compared across
different population subgroups and over time. Data
on crimes that occur away from school are offered as
a point of comparison where available.

Violent Deaths

»»

Of the 38 student, staff, and nonstudent schoolassociated violent deaths1 occurring between July
1, 2008, and June 30, 2009, 24 were homicides,
and 14 were suicides. From July 1, 2008, through
June 30, 2009, there were 15 homicides and
7 suicides of school-age youth (ages 5–18) at
school (Indicator 1).

»»

During the school year 2007–08, there were
1,701 homicides among school-age youth ages
5–18. During the 2007 calendar year, there were
1,231 suicides of youth ages 5–18 (Indicator 1).

1

  School-associated violent death is defined as “a homicide,
suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement
officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of
a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United
States.” Victims of school-associated violent deaths included
students, staff members, and others who are not students.
2
  “At school” includes inside the school building, on school
property, or on the way to or from school.
3
  Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and completed thefts except motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include
robbery in which threat or use of force is involved.
4
  Violent crimes include serious violent incidents and simple
assault.
5
  Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery,
and aggravated assault.

Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization

»»

In 2008, students ages 12 to 18 were victims of
about 1.2 million nonfatal crimes (theft3 plus
violent crime4) at school,2 compared to about
1 million nonfatal crimes away from school
(Indicator 2).

»»

The total at-school crime and theft victimization
rates of students ages 12 to 18 declined between
2007 and 2008. The total crime victimization
rate of students ages 12 to 18 at school declined
from 57 victimizations per 1,000 students in
2007 to 47 victimizations per 1,000 students in
2008 (Indicator 2).

»»

The rates for serious violent crimes were lower at
school than away from school in 2008. In 2008,
students ages 12–18 were victims of 4 serious
violent crimes per 1,000 students at school and
8 serious violent crimes per 1,000 students away
from school (Indicator 2).

»»

In 2007, 4 percent of students ages 12–18
reported being victimized at school during the
previous 6 months: 3 percent reported theft,3
and 2 percent reported violent victimization4
(Indicator 3). Less than half of a percent of
students reported serious violent victimization.5

»»

Eight percent of students in grades 9–12 reported
being threatened or injured with a weapon, such
as a gun, knife, or club, on school property6 in
2009. Specifically, 3 percent of students were
threatened or injured with a weapon one time,
2 percent were threatened or injured with a
weapon two or three times, 1 percent were
threatened or injured with a weapon four to
eleven times, and 1 percent were threatened or
injured with a weapon twelve or more times7
(Indicator 4).

In 2009, 10 percent of male students in grades
9–12 reported being threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property in the past
year, compared to 5 percent of female students
(Indicator 4).

During the 2007–08 school year, a greater
percentage of teachers in city schools (10
percent) reported being threatened with injury

than teachers in town schools (7 percent) and
suburban or rural schools (6 percent each)
(Indicator 5). A greater percentage of teachers
in city schools (5 percent) and suburban schools
(4 percent) reported being physically attacked,
compared to teachers in rural schools (3 percent).

A greater percentage of secondary school
teachers (8 percent) reported being threatened
with injury by a student than elementary school
teachers (7 percent) (Indicator 5). However, a
greater percentage of elementary school teachers
(6 percent) reported being physically attacked
than secondary school teachers (2 percent).

School Environment

»»

During the 2007–08 school year, 85 percent
of public schools recorded that one or more
incidents of crime had taken place at school,2
amounting to an estimated 2.0 million crimes
(table 6.1). This figure translates to a rate of 43
crimes per 1,000 public school students enrolled
in 2007–08. During the same year, 62 percent of
public schools reported an incident of crime that
occurred at school to the police, amounting to
about 704,000 crimes—or 15 crimes per 1,000
public school students enrolled (Indicator 6 ).

In 2007–08, 75 percent of public schools recorded
one or more violent incidents of crime,4 17 percent
recorded one or more serious violent incidents,5
47 percent recorded one or more thefts,8 and 67
percent recorded one or more other incidents.9
Thirty-eight percent of public schools reported
at least one violent incident to police, 13 percent

Twenty percent of public schools reported
that gang activities had happened at all during
2007–08 and 3 percent reported that cult or

that school year (Indicator 7).

»»

In 2007, 23 percent of students ages 12–18
reported that there were gangs at their schools
(Indicator 8). Overall, a smaller percentage of
White students (16 percent) and Asian students
(17 percent) reported a gang presence at school
than Black students (38 percent) and Hispanic
students (36 percent).

student misbehavior (39 percent vs. 33 percent)
and student tardiness and class cutting (45
percent vs. 26 percent) interfered with their
teaching in 2007–08 (Indicator 12). During

»»

In 2009, 31 percent of students in grades 9–12
reported they had been in a physical fight at
least one time during the previous 12 months
anywhere, and 11 percent said they had been in
a fight on school property during the previous

students in 9th grade reported having been in
fights than students in any other grade, both
anywhere and on school property. Generally, a
smaller percentage of Asian students reported
being in physical fights anywhere and on school
property than students of other racial/ethnic
groups. In addition, 4 percent of males said
they had been in a fight anywhere twelve or
more times, compared to 1 percent of females,
and 1 percent of males said they had been in a

In 2009, about 42 percent of students in grades
9–12 reported having at least one drink of
alcohol anywhere in the past 30 days, while
4 percent had at least one drink on school
property (Indicator 15).

»»

Since 2003, there has been no measurable
difference between the percentages of male and
female students in grades 9–12 who reported
alcohol consumption anywhere. However, there
were differences in the reporting of how often
alcohol was consumed in 2009. For example, a
higher percentage of females than males reported
consuming alcohol either one or two days out
of the previous 30 days in 2009 (23 percent vs.
18 percent). In addition, a higher percentage of
males than females reported consuming alcohol
from three to twenty-nine days (22 percent vs.
19 percent). One percent of male students
reported consuming alcohol anywhere all thirty
days (figure 15.2 and table 15.3). In terms of
alcohol use on school property, males reported
using alcohol at least one time during the
previous 30 days at a greater percentage than
did females in every survey year (Indicator 15).

In 2009, 27 percent of males carried a weapon
anywhere, compared to 7 percent of females, and
8 percent of males carried a weapon on school
property, compared to 3 percent of females
(Indicator 14).

In 2009, 21 percent of students in grades 9–12
reported using marijuana anywhere in the
past 30 days, while 5 percent reported using
marijuana on school property. According to
students’ reports, male students were twice as
likely as females to use marijuana on school
property (6 percent vs. 3 percent, respectively).
Six percent of male students reported using
marijuana anywhere 40 times or more during
the previous 30 days, compared to 2 percent of
females. One percent of males reported using
marijuana on school property 40 times or more,
compared to less than one-half percent of females
(Indicator 16).
Genera lly among 9th–12th-graders, the
percentage of Asian students reporting using
marijuana anywhere and on school property
during the previous 30 days was smaller than
that of most other racial/ethnic groups. In
addition, the percentage of students reporting
using marijuana anywhere increased with
grade level: a smaller percentage of 9th-graders
reported using marijuana anywhere (16 percent),

Executive Summary

than 10th-graders (21 percent), 11th-graders
(23 percent), and 12th-graders (25 percent)
(Indicator 16).
Fear and Avoidance

»»

In 2007, approximately 5 percent of students ages
12–18 reported that they were afraid of attack or
harm at school, and 3 percent reported that they
were afraid of attack or harm away from school
(Indicator 17). In 2007, smaller percentages of
White students (4 percent) and Asian students
(2 percent) reported being afraid of attack or
harm at school than their Black (9 percent) and
Hispanic (7 percent) peers.

»»

In 2007, 7 percent of students ages 12–18
reported that they had avoided a school activity
or one or more places in school in the previous
6 months because of fear of attack or harm:
3 percent of students avoided a school activity,
and 6 percent avoided one or more places in
school (Indicator 18).

Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures

»»

Forty-six percent of public schools (approximately
38,500 schools) took at least one serious
disciplinary action against a student during the
2007–08 school year. Of the 767,900 serious
disciplinary actions taken, 76 percent were
suspensions for 5 days or more, 19 percent were
transfers to specialized schools, and 5 percent
were removals with no services for the remainder
of the school year (Indicator 19).

»»

Although the overall percentage of public schools
taking a serious disciplinary action declined
between 1999–2000 (54 percent) and 2003–04
(46 percent), there has been no measurable
change since then. This same general pattern
of decline between the period of 1999–2000
and 2003–04 with no measurable change in
more recent survey years held both for the
percentage of public schools that reported taking
serious disciplinary actions for the offense of
physical attacks or fights and for the offense of
insubordination (Indicator 19).

»»

Between the 1999–2000 and 2007–08 school
years, there was an increase in the percentage of
public schools reporting the use of the following
safety and security measures: controlled access
to the building during school hours (from 75
percent to 90 percent); controlled access to
school grounds during school hours (from

34 percent to 43 percent); students required to
wear badges or picture IDs (from 4 percent to
8 percent); faculty required to wear badges or
picture IDs (from 25 percent to 58 percent); the
use of one or more security cameras to monitor
school (from 19 percent to 55 percent); the
provision of telephones in most classrooms (from
45 percent to 72 percent); and the requirement
that students wear uniforms (from 12 percent to
18 percent) (Indicator 20).

»»

Between the 2003–04 and 2007–08 school years,
there was an increase in the percentage of public
schools reporting the drug testing of student
athletes (from 4 percent to 6 percent), as well as
an increase in the percentage of public schools
reporting the drug testing of students in other
extracurricular activities (from 3 percent to 4
percent) (Indicator 20).

»»

During the 2007–08 school year, 43 percent
of public schools reported that they had an
electronic notification system for a school-wide
emergency, and 31 percent of public schools
reported that they had a structured, anonymous
threat reporting system (Indicator 20).

»»

The majority of students ages 12–18 reported
that their school had a student code of conduct
(96 percent) and a requirement that visitors sign
in (94 percent) in 2007 (Indicator 21). Metal
detectors were the least commonly observed
security measure. Ten percent of students
reported the use of metal detectors at their school.

Foreword
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2010 provides
the most recent national indicators on school crime
and safety. The information presented in this report
is intended to serve as a reference for policymakers
and practitioners so that they can develop effective programs and policies aimed at violence and
school crime prevention. Accurate information
about the nature, extent, and scope of the problem
being addressed is essential for developing effective
programs and policies.
This is the thirteenth edition of Indicators of School
Crime and Safety, a joint publication of the Bureau
of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES). This report provides
detailed statistics to inform the nation about current
aspects of crime and safety in schools.
The 2010 edition of Indicators of School Crime and
Safety includes the most recent available data, compiled
from a number of statistical data sources supported
by the federal government. Such sources include
results from a study of violent deaths in schools,
sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education

and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC); the National Crime Victimization Survey and
School Crime Supplement to the survey, sponsored
by the BJS and NCES, respectively; the Youth Risk
Behavior Survey, sponsored by the CDC; and the
Schools and Staffing Survey and School Survey on
Crime and Safety, both sponsored by NCES.
The entire report is available on the Internet
(http://nces.ed.gov/programs/crimeindicators/

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2010

Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for
teaching and learning free of crime and violence.
Any instance of crime or violence at school not only
affects the individuals involved but also may disrupt
the educational process and affect bystanders, the
school itself, and the surrounding community (Henry
2000). For both students and teachers, victimization at school can have lasting effects. In addition to
experiencing loneliness, depression, and adjustment
difficulties (Crick and Bigbee 1998; Crick and Grotpeter 1996; Nansel et al. 2001; Prinstein, Boergers,
and Vernberg 2001; Storch et al. 2003), victimized
children are more prone to truancy (Ringwalt, Ennett, and Johnson 2003), poor academic performance
(MacMillan and Hagan 2004; Wei and Williams
2004), dropping out of school (Beauvais et al. 1996;
MacMillan and Hagan 2004), and violent behaviors
(Nansel et al. 2003). For teachers, incidents of victimization may lead to professional disenchantment
and even departure from the profession altogether
(Karcher 2002; Smith and Smith 2006).
For parents, school staff, and policymakers to effectively address school crime, they need an accurate
understanding of the extent, nature, and context of
the problem. However, it is difficult to gauge the
scope of crime and violence in schools given the large
amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of
extreme school violence. Measuring progress toward
safer schools requires establishing good indicators of
the current state of school crime and safety across
the nation and regularly updating and monitoring
these indicators; this is the aim of Indicators of School
Crime and Safety.

Purpose and Organization of This Report
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2010 is the
thirteenth in a series of reports produced since 1998
by the National Center for Education Statistics
(NCES) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) that
present the most recent data available on school crime
and student safety. The report is not intended to be
an exhaustive compilation of school crime and safety
information, nor does it attempt to explore reasons for
crime and violence in schools. Rather, it is designed
to provide a brief summary of information from an
array of data sources and to make data on national
school crime and safety accessible to policymakers,
educators, parents, and the general public.
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2010 is
organized into sections that delineate specific
concerns to readers, starting with a description of the
most serious violent crimes. The sections cover Violent
Deaths; Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization;
2

Introduction

School Environment; Fights, Weapons, and Illegal
Substances; Fear and Avoidance; and Discipline,
Safety, and Security Measures. Each section contains
a set of indicators that, taken together, aim to describe
a distinct aspect of school crime and safety. Where
available, data on crimes that occur outside of school
grounds are offered as a point of comparison.1
Supplemental tables for each indicator provide more
detailed breakouts and standard errors for estimates.
A glossary of terms and a reference section appear at
the end of the report. Standard errors for the estimate
tables are available online.
This year’s report contains updated data for eight
indicators: violent deaths at school and away from
school (Indicator 1), incidence of victimization at
school and away from school (Indicator 2), threats
and injuries with weapons on school property
(Indicator 4), students’ reports of drug availability
on school property (Indicator 9), physical fights on
school property and anywhere (Indicator 13), students
carrying weapons on school property and anywhere
(Indicator 14), students’ use of alcohol on school
property and anywhere (Indicator 15), and students’
use of marijuana on school property and anywhere
(Indicator 16).
Also found in this year’s report are references to recent
publications relevant to each indicator that the reader
may want to consult for additional information or
analyses. These references can be found in the “For
more information” sidebars at the bottom of each
indicator.

Data
The indicators in this report are based on information
drawn from a variety of independent data sources,
including national surveys of students, teachers, and
principals and universe data collections from federal
departments and agencies, including BJS, NCES, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. Each data source
has an independent sample design, data collection
method, and questionnaire design, or is the result of
a universe data collection.
The combination of multiple, independent sources
of data provides a broad perspective on school crime
and safety that could not be achieved through any
single source of information. However, readers should
be cautious when comparing data from different

  Data in this report are not adjusted to reflect the number
of hours that youths spend on school property versus the
number of hours they spend elsewhere.

sources. While every effort has been made to keep key
definitions consistent across indicators, differences in
sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and
question phrasing can all affect the comparability of
results. For example, both Indicators 20 and 21 report
data on selected security and safety measures used in
schools. Indicator 20 uses data collected from a survey
of public school principals about safety and security
practices used in their schools during the 2007–08
school year. The schools range from primary through
high schools. Indicator 21, however, uses data collected from 12- through 18-year-old students residing
in a sample of households. These students were asked
whether they observed selected safety and security
measures in their school in 2007, but they may not
have known whether, in fact, the security measure
was present. In addition, different indicators contain
various approaches to the analysis of school crime
data and, therefore, will show different perspectives
on school crime. For example, both Indicators 2 and
3 report data on theft and violent crime at school
based on the National Crime Victimization Survey
and the School Crime Supplement to that survey,
respectively. While Indicator 2 examines the number of incidents of crime, Indicator 3 examines the
percentage or prevalence of students who reported
victimization. Table A provides a summary of some
of the variations in the design and coverage of sample
surveys used in this report.
Several indicators in this report are based on selfreported survey data. Readers should note that
limitations inherent to self-reported data may affect
estimates (Addington 2005; Cantor and Lynch 2000).
First, unless an interview is “bounded” or a reference
period is established, estimates may include events
that exceed the scope of the specified reference period.
This factor may artificially increase reported incidents
because respondents may recall events outside of the
given reference period. Second, many of the surveys
rely on the respondent to “self-determine” a condition.
This factor allows the respondent to define a situation
based upon his or her own interpretation of whether
the incident was a crime or not. On the other hand,
the same situation may not necessarily be interpreted
in the same way by a bystander or the perceived offender. Third, victim surveys tend to emphasize crime
events as incidents that take place at one point in
time. However, victims can often experience a state of
victimization in which they are threatened or victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally, respondents may
recall an event inaccurately. For instance, people may
forget the event entirely or recall the specifics of the
episode incorrectly. These and other factors may affect
the precision of the estimates based on these surveys.

Data trends are discussed in this report when possible.
Where trends are not discussed, either the data are
not available in earlier surveys or the wording of the
survey question changed from year to year, eliminating the ability to discuss any trend. For example, in
Indicator 11, which reports on bullying using data
from the School Crime Supplement survey, the 2007
questionnaire was revised to include information on
cyber-bullying. Due to this change, the text of this
indicator no longer presents trend information.
Where data from samples are reported, as is the
case with most of the indicators in this report, the
standard error is calculated for each estimate provided
in order to determine the “margin of error” for these
estimates. The standard errors of the estimates for
different subpopulations in an indicator can vary
considerably and should be taken into account when
making comparisons. With the exception of Indicator
2, in this report, in cases where the standard error
was at least 30 percent of the associated estimate, the
estimates were noted with a “!” symbol (interpret data
with caution). In Indicator 2, the “!” symbol cautions
the reader that estimates marked indicate that the
reported statistic was based on fewer than 10 cases.
In cases where the standard error was greater than
50 percent of the associated estimate, the estimate
was suppressed. See appendix A for more information.
The comparisons in the text have been tested for
statistical significance to ensure that the differences
are larger than might be expected due to sampling
variation. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited
in the report are statistically significant at the .05
level. Several test procedures were used, depending
upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature
of the statement being tested. The primary test
procedure used in this report was Student’s t statistic,
which tests the difference between two sample
estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for
multiple comparisons. Linear trend tests were used
when differences among percentages were examined
relative to interval categories of a variable, rather than
the differences between two discrete categories. This
test allows one to examine whether, for example, the
percentage of students who reported using drugs
increased (or decreased) over time or whether the
percentage of students who reported being physically
attacked in school increased (or decreased) with age.
When differences among percentages were examined
relative to a variable with ordinal categories (such as
grade), analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test
for a linear relationship between the two variables.

Although percentages reported in the tables are generally rounded to one decimal place (e.g., 76.5 percent),
percentages reported in the text and figures are generally rounded from the original number to whole
numbers (with any value of 0.50 or above rounded
to the next highest whole number). While the data

Indicator 1
Violent Deaths at School and Away From School
The percentage of youth homicides occurring at school remained at less than 2 percent of the total number
of youth homicides, and the percentage of youth suicides occurring at school remained at less than 1 percent
of the total number of youth suicides over all available survey years.
Violent deaths at schools are rare but tragic events
with far-reaching effects on the school population
and surrounding community. In this indicator, data
on school-associated violent deaths are collected using
the School Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance
Study (SAVD).
The most recent data collected for this survey covers
the time period from July 1, 2008, through June
30, 2009. During this time period, there were 38
school-associated violent deaths in elementary and
secondary schools in the United States (figure 1.1
and tables 1.1 and 1.2). A school-associated violent
death is defined as “a homicide, suicide, or legal
intervention (involving a law enforcement officer),
in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of
a functioning elementary or secondary school in the
United States.” Victims of school-associated violent
deaths include not only students and staff members,
but also others who are not students or staff members,
such as parents. School-associated violent deaths
include those that occurred while the victim was
on the way to or returning from regular sessions at
school or while the victim was attending or traveling
to or from an official school-sponsored event. Of the
38 student, staff, and nonstudent school-associated
violent deaths occurring between July 1, 2008, and
June 30, 2009, 24 were homicides and 14 were
suicides (table 1.2). Data for school-associated violent
deaths for the 2008–09 school year are preliminary.
Data on homicides and suicides at-school and awayfrom-school were drawn from a number of sources,
while ‘away-from-school’ is added as a point of comparison. The availability for data on homicides and
data on suicides at-school and away-from-school
differs in time period. The most recent data available
for total suicides of school-age youth only (youth ages
5–18) are for the 2007 calendar year; the most recent

data available for total homicides of youth ages 5–18
are for the 2007–08 school year.2 During 2007–08,
there were 1,701 homicides of youth ages 5–18 (figure
1.2 and table 1.1). During the 2007 calendar year,
there were 1,231 suicides of youth ages 5–18. From
July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2009, there were
15 homicides and 7 suicides of school-age youth at
school (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). In each year during
the period 1992–93 to 2007–08, there were at least
50 times as many homicides of youth away from
school than at school and generally at least 150 times
as many suicides of youth away from school than at
school. During the 2008–09 school year, there was
approximately one homicide or suicide of a school-age
youth at school per 2.5 million students enrolled.3
The percentage of youth homicides occurring at
school remained at less than 2 percent of the total
number of youth homicides over all available survey
years, even though the absolute number of homicides
of school-age youth at school varied to some degree
across the years (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). Between
the 1992–93 and 2008–09 school years, from 1 to
10 school-age youth committed suicide at school each
year, with no consistent pattern of increase or decrease
in the number of suicides. The percentage of youth
suicides occurring at school remained at less than
1 percent of the total number of youth suicides over
all available survey years.
2

  Data on total suicides are available only by calendar year,
whereas data on suicides and homicides at school and data
on total homicides are available by school year. Due to these
differences in reference periods, please use caution when
comparing violent deaths at school to total violent deaths.
Data for total suicides (2008) and total homicides (2008–
09) are not yet available.
3
  The total number of students enrolled in prekindergarten
through 12th grade during the 2008–09 school year was
55,632,498 (Snyder and Dillow 2010).

This indicator has been updated to include 2008–09 data. For more information: Tables 1.1 and 1.2 and Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (2008), (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5702a1.htm).

A school-associated violent death is defined as “a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal
injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States” while the victim was on the way to or from
regular sessions at school or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims include students, staff
members, and others who are not students, from July 1, 1992, through June 30, 2009.		
NOTE: “At school” includes on school property, on the way to or from regular sessions at school, and while attending or traveling to or from a schoolsponsored event. Estimates were revised and may differ from previously published data.					
SOURCE: Data on homicides and suicides of youth ages 5–18 at school and total school-associated violent deaths are from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1992–2009 School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study (SAVD), partially funded by the U.S.
Department of Education, Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools, previously unpublished tabulation (July 2010).

Indicator 2
Incidence of Victimization at School and Away From School
For students ages 12 to 18, the rates for serious violent crimes in 2008 were lower at school than away from
school. The 2008 victimization rates for serious violent crimes were 4 per 1,000 students at school, and
8 per 1,000 students away from school.
Theft and violence both at school and while going to
and from school can affect the overall health and wellbeing of adolescents, interfere with educational goals,
and stall normal healthy development (Fredland
2008). This type of victimization can also lead to
higher than average rates of teacher turnover and
increases in student dropout rates, students changing
schools, and principals and teachers retiring early
(Crews, Crews, and Turner 2008).
In 2008, data from the National Crime Victimization
Survey4 showed that more crimes were committed
against students ages 12 to 18 at school than away
from school. Students ages 12 to 18 experienced
about 1.2 million nonfatal crimes (theft5 plus violent
crime 6 ) at school,7 compared to about 1 million
nonfatal crimes away from school (table 2.1).8 These
figures represent total crime victimization rates of 47
crimes per 1,000 students at school and 38 crimes per
1,000 students away from school.

Victimization rates of students ages 12 to 18 generally
declined between 1992 and 2008. This pattern held
for the total crime rate both at school and away from
school as well as for the rates of the three components
making up the total crime rate: thefts, violent crimes,
and serious violent crimes. Between 2007 and 2008,
the total crime rates against students ages 12 to
18 at school declined from 57 victimizations per
1,000 students to 47 per 1,000 students. The rate
of victimization by theft at school declined from 31
per 1,000 students ages 12 to 18 in 2007 to 24 per
1,000 in 2008. There was no measurable difference
in the rate of victimization by violent crime against
students ages 12 to 18 at school between 2007 and
2008. Additionally, total crime, theft, and violent
crime victimization rates away from school were not
measurably different between 2007 and 2008.

  Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on similar
topics, the survey sources for these two indicators differ with
respect to time coverage and administration. For more information on these two surveys, please see appendix A.
5
  Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and completed
thefts except motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which threat or use of force is involved.
6
  Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and simple assault.
7
  “At school” includes inside the school building, on school
property, or on the way to or from school.
8
  “Students” refers to youth ages 12–18 whose educational
attainment did not exceed grade 12 at the time of the survey.
An uncertain percentage of these persons may not have attended school during the survey reference period. These data

Generally, between 1992 and 2007, the rate of theft
at school among students ages 12 to 18 was higher
than the rate of theft away from school. There were
no measurable differences in these rates in 2008.
For most years between 1992 and 2005,9 the rate
of violent crimes per 1,000 students away from
school was either higher than the at-school rate or
not measurably different from the at-school rate.
However, in 2007 the rate of violent crimes per 1,000
students ages 12 to 18 at school was higher than the
rate for those away from school. In 2008, there was
no measurable difference.10
Rates of serious violent crimes11 against students ages
12 to 18 at school were lower than those occurring
away from school in each survey year between 1992
and 2008, 6 except in 2007, when there was no
difference detected. In 2008, students ages 12 to 18
were victims of 4 serious violent crimes per 1,000
students at school and 8 serious violent crimes per
1,000 students away from school.

  There was a redesign of the methods used to measure victimization in the 2006 National Crime Victimization Survey
(NCVS). Due to this redesign, 2006 data are not presented
in this indicator. For more information, please see appendix
A.
10

level, the level used to identify differences throughout the
report.
11
  Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.

Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization

In 2008, the victimization rates for students ages
12 to 18 varied according to student characteristics.
There were no measurable differences by age group
(i.e., students ages 12 to 14 vs. students ages 15 to
18) in the rates of total crime, theft, and violent
victimizations at school (figure 2.2 and table 2.2).
However, the rates of total crime, theft, violent, and
serious violent victimizations away from school were
lower for younger students (ages 12 to 14) than for
older students (ages 15 to 18) (figure 2.2 and table
2.3). For example, the total crime victimization rate
away from school was 25 per 1,000 students ages 12
to 14 and 49 per 1,000 students ages 15 to 18. For
students ages 12 to 14, violent victimization rates
away from school were 12 per 1,000, compared to
25 per 1,000 for students ages 15 to 18. The serious
violent victimization rate away from school was 4
per 1,000 students ages 12 to 14 and 11 per 1,000
students ages 15 to 18. No measurable differences
were detected by gender between the rates of thefts per
1,000 students either at or away from school. Females
had lower rates of violent crime victimization than
males both at school and away from school in 2008.

Indicator 3
Prevalence of Victimization at School
In 2007, 4 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being victimized at school during the previous
6 months. About 3 percent of students reported theft, 2 percent reported violent victimization, and less than
half of a percent reported serious violent victimization.
Theft is the most frequent type of nonfatal
victimization in the United States (U.S. Department
of Justice 2007). Data from the School Crime
Supplement12 show the percentage of students
ages 12–18 who reported criminal victimization
at school13 during the previous 6 months. In 2007,
4 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being
victimized at school during the previous 6 months.
About 3 percent of students reported theft,14 2 percent
reported violent victimization15 (figure 3.1 and table
3.1), and less than half of a percent reported serious
violent victimization.16

victimization was higher for students in the 7th or 9th
grade than for students in the 12th grade; however,
no other measurable differences in the percentages
reporting victimization were found across grades. In
2007, no measurable differences were detected in the
percentages of White, Black, or Hispanic students who
reported victimization, theft, or violent victimization.
However, a higher percentage of students of other
races/ethnicities than Hispanic students reported
victimization, and a higher percentage of students
of other races/ethnicities than White or Hispanic
students reported violent victimization.

In 2007, the prevalence of victimization varied
somewhat according to student characteristics. For
all types of victimization, no measurable differences
were detected by sex in the likelihood of reporting
victimization. The percentage of students reporting

Some differences were also seen by school sector in the
prevalence of victimization reported in 2007. A higher
percentage of students in public schools reported
victimization (5 percent) and theft (3 percent) than
students in private schools (1 percent each).

Overall, the percentage of students ages 12–18
who were victimized at school decreased between
1995 and 2005 from 10 to 4 percent. For each
type of victimization, the percentage of students
reporting victimization decreased between 1995
and 2005. Between the most recent survey years
(2005 and 2007), there were no measurable changes
in the percentage of students reporting any type of
victimization.

Indicator 4
Threats and Injuries With Weapons on School Property
From 1993 through 2009, the percentage of students who were threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property fluctuated between 7 and 9 percent.
Every year, some students are threatened or injured
with a weapon while they are on school property.
The percentage of students victimized in this way
provides a measure of how safe our schools are, and
if levels of safety in school have changed over time.
In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in
grades 9–12 were asked whether and how often they
had been threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property17 during the 12 months preceding
the survey. From 1993 through 2009, the percentage
of students who were threatened or injured with a
weapon fluctuated between 7 and 9 percent. For
example, in 2009, 8 percent of students reported
being threatened or injured with a weapon, such as
a gun, knife, or club, on school property (table 4.1).
Specifically, 3 percent of students were threatened
or injured with a weapon one time, 2 percent were
threatened or injured with a weapon two or three
times, 1 percent were threatened or injured with a
weapon four to eleven times, and 1 percent were
threatened or injured with a weapon twelve or more
times18 (figure 4.3 and table 4.3).
The likelihood of being threatened or injured with
a weapon on school property varied by student
characteristics, including sex and grade level. In each
survey year, a higher percentage of males than females
reported being threatened or injured with a weapon
on school property (table 4.1). In 2009, the percentage
of male students who reported being threatened or
injured in the past year was nearly twice as high as
the percentage of female students (10 and 5 percent,
respectively). Generally, the percentage of students
who reported being threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property decreased with

grade level (figure 4.1 and table 4.1). For example, in
2009, a smaller percentage of 12th-graders (5 percent)
reported that they were threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property than the percentages of
9th-, 10th-, and 11th-graders (9, 8, and 8 percent,
respectively).
The percentage of students who reported being
threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property varied by race/ethnicity in 2009 (figure
4.2 and table 4.1). Specifically, smaller percentages
of White students and Asian students (6 and 5
percent, respectively) than American Indian/Alaska
Native students (16 percent), and Black students
and Hispanic students (9 percent each) reported
being threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property. The percentage of American Indian/Alaska
Native students who reported being threatened
or injured with a weapon was higher than the
percentages of Black students, Hispanic students,
and students of two or more races (9 percent). In
addition, higher percentages of Pacific Islander/Native
Hawaiian students and students of two or more races
(13 and 9 percent, respectively) than Asian students
reported being threatened or injured with a weapon.
In 2009, the percentage of students being threatened
or injured with a weapon on school property varied
among the 39 states for which data were available.
Among these states, the percentage of students who
reported being threatened or injured on school
property ranged from 6 percent in Indiana, Kansas,
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Vermont to 12 percent
in Arkansas (table 4.2).

Indicator 5
Teachers Threatened With Injury or Physically Attacked by Students
A greater percentage of teachers in city schools than teachers in suburban, town, or rural schools reported
being threatened with injury during the 2007–08 school year.
Students are not the only victims of intimidation or
violence in schools. Teachers are also subject to threats
and physical attacks, and students from their schools
sometimes commit these offenses. In the Schools and
Staffing Survey, teachers were asked whether they had
been threatened with injury or physically attacked by
a student from their school in the previous 12 months.
During the 2007–08 school year, a smaller percentage
of teachers, 7 percent, were threatened with injury
by a student from their school than in 1993–94 (12
percent) and 1999–2000 (9 percent), though this
percentage was not measurably different from the percentage in 2003–04 (7 percent) (figure 5.1 and table
5.1). The percentage of teachers reporting that they
had been physically attacked by a student from their
school, 4 percent, was not measurably different in
2007–08 than in any previous survey year (table 5.2).
A greater percentage of teachers in city schools than
teachers in suburban, town, or rural schools reported
being threatened with injury during the 2007–08
school year (figure 5.2 and table 5.1). Ten percent of
teachers in city schools were threatened with injury by
students, compared to 7 percent of teachers in town
schools and 6 percent each of teachers in suburban
and rural schools. A greater percentage of teachers
in city schools (5 percent) and suburban schools (4
percent) than teachers in rural schools (3 percent)
reported being physically attacked (table 5.2).
During 2007–08, teachers’ reports of being threatened or physically attacked by students varied
according to the instructional level of their school.
A greater percentage of secondary school teachers (8
percent) than elementary school teachers (7 percent)
reported being threatened with injury by a student,
and this pattern held for teachers in suburban schools
as well as for teachers in rural schools (table 5.1 and
figure 5.2). The apparent difference in the percentage
of elementary and secondary teachers in city schools

who reported being threatened with injury was not
statistically significant. However, a greater percentage
of elementary school teachers (6 percent) reported
having been physically attacked than secondary
school teachers (2 percent), and this pattern held
true for teachers in city, suburban, town, and rural
schools (table 5.2).
A greater percentage of public than private school
teachers reported being threatened with injury (8 vs.
3 percent) or physically attacked (4 vs. 2 percent) by
students during 2007–08 (tables 5.1 and 5.2). Among
teachers in city schools, there were at least five times as
many public school teachers as private school teachers
who reported being threatened with injury (12 vs. 2
percent) and at least four times as many public school
teachers as private school teachers who reported being
physically attacked (6 vs. 1 percent).
In all survey years, a greater percentage of male teachers reported having been threatened with injury than
female teachers (table 5.1). For example, in 2007–08,
9 percent of male teachers reported that they were
threatened with injury by students, compared to 7
percent of female teachers; this pattern held true for
teachers in city and suburban schools in 2007–08,
as well.
Public school teachers’ reports of being threatened
with injury or physically attacked varied among
the states and the District of Columbia. During
2007–08, the percentage of public school teachers
who reported being threatened with injury during the
previous 12 months ranged from 3 percent in North
Dakota to 17 percent in the District of Columbia
(table 5.3), and the percentage who reported being
physically attacked ranged from 2 percent in New
Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, and Ohio
to 8 percent in Maryland (table 5.4).

Violent and Other Crime Incidents at Public Schools and Those
Reported to the Police
In 2007–08, 75 percent of public schools recorded one or more violent incidents of crime, 17 percent recorded
one or more serious violent incidents, and 47 percent recorded one or more thefts.
In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public
school principals were asked to provide the number of
violent incidents,19 serious violent incidents,20 thefts
of items valued at $10 or greater without personal
confrontation, and other incidents21 that occurred
at their school;22 public school principals were also
asked to provide the number of incidents reported
to the police. This indicator presents the percentage
of public schools that recorded one or more of these
specified crimes, the total number of these crimes
recorded, and the rate of crimes per 1,000 students.
These data are also presented for crimes that were
reported to the police. During the 2007–08 school
19
  Violent incidents include serious violent incidents; physical attack or fight without a weapon; and threat of physical
attack without a weapon.
20
  Serious violent incidents include rape or attempted rape;
sexual battery other than rape; physical attack or fight with
a weapon; threat of physical attack with a weapon; and robbery with or without a weapon.
21
  Other incidents include possession of a firearm or explosive device; possession of a knife or sharp object; distribution,
possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol; and vandalism.
22
  “At school” was defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on
school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events
or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school
hours or when school activities or events were in session.

year, 85 percent of public schools recorded that one
or more of these incidents of violence, theft, or other
crimes, had taken place, amounting to an estimated
2.0 million crimes (figure 6.1 and table 6.1). This
figure translates to a rate of 43 crimes per 1,000
students enrolled in 2007–08. During the same year,
62 percent of schools reported one of the specified
crimes to the police, amounting to about 704,000
crimes—or 15 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled.
In 2007–08, a greater percentage of schools recorded
an incident of crime than reported an incident of
crime to the police. This pattern held true for violent
crimes, serious violent crimes, thefts, and other
crimes. Similarly, the rate of recorded incidents per
1,000 students was higher than the rate of incidents
reported to the police per 1,000 students; this held
true for violent crime, serious violent crime, theft,
and other crime. In 2007–08, 75 percent of schools
recorded one or more violent incidents of crime,
17 percent recorded one or more serious violent
incidents, 47 percent recorded one or more thefts,
and 67 percent recorded one or more other incidents.
In comparison, 38 percent of public schools reported
at least one violent incident to police, 13 percent
reported at least one serious violent incident to
police, 31 percent reported at least one theft to
police, and 49 percent reported one or more other
incidents to police.

The percentage of schools that recorded incidents of
violent crime varied by school characteristics. For
example, a smaller percentage of primary schools
(65 percent) than middle schools or high schools
(94 percent each) recorded violent incidents of crime
(table 6.2). However, the rate of recorded violent
crimes per 1,000 students was larger for middle
schools (41 incidents per 1,000 students) than for
primary schools (26 incidents per 1,000 students)
or high schools (22 incidents per 1,000 students).
With regard to public schools that reported incidents
of violent crime to the police, a greater percentage
of high schools (75 percent) reported violent crimes
to the police than middle schools (64 percent) or
primary schools (20 percent) (table 6.3). There was
no measurable difference between the rate per 1,000
students of reported violent incidents at high schools
and middle schools (11 incidents per 1,000).
There was a range in the number of crimes recorded
and reported by schools in 2007–08. One-quarter of
schools recorded zero violent crimes, and 24 percent
of schools recorded 20 or more violent crimes (figure
6.2 and table 6.4). Sixty-two percent of schools did
not report a violent crime to the police, compared to
5 percent of schools that reported 20 or more violent
crimes to the police. In regard to serious violent

26

School Environment

crimes, 83 percent of schools did not record a serious
violent crime, compared to 1 percent of schools that
recorded 10 or more such crimes (table 6.5).
The range in the number of crimes recorded by
schools varied by school characteristics. For example,
a larger percentage of city schools recorded 20 or
more violent incidents in 2007–08 than suburban
schools, town schools, or rural schools (table 6.4). In
2007–08, 36 percent of city schools recorded 20 or
more violent incidents, compared to 24 percent of
suburban schools, 21 percent of town schools, and
14 percent of rural schools.
The percentages of public schools recording incidents
of crime or reporting incidents of crime to the police
in 2007–08 were not measurably different from
the percentages of schools doing so in 1999–2000
(figure 6.3 and table 6.1). While this pattern held
true for the percentage of public schools reporting
violent incidents, as well as the percentage of schools
recording and reporting serious violent incidents
and thefts, there was an increase in the percentage
of schools recording violent incidents over this
period (from 71 to 75 percent) and a decrease in
the percentage of schools recording other incidents
during this period (from 73 to 67 percent).

Indicator 7
Discipline Problems Reported by Public Schools
During the 2007–08 school year, 25 percent of public schools reported that bullying occurred among students
on a daily or weekly basis, 11 percent reported that student acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal
abuse took place on a daily or weekly basis, and 6 percent reported that student verbal abuse of teachers
occurred on a daily or weekly basis.
In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public
school principals were asked how often certain
disciplinary problems happen in their schools.23 This
indicator examines the daily or weekly occurrence
of student racial/ethnic tensions, bullying, sexual
harassment of other students, verbal abuse of teachers,
acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse,
and widespread disorder in the classroom. It also
looks at occurrences of gang and cult or extremist
group activities, and, due to the severe nature of these
incidents, presents any reports of gang and cult or
extremist group activities that occurred during the
school year.
During the 2007–08 school year, 25 percent of public schools reported that bullying occurred among
students on a daily or weekly basis and 11 percent
reported that student acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse took place on a daily or
weekly basis (table 7.1). With regard to other discipline
problems reported as occurring at least once a week,
6 percent of schools reported student verbal abuse
of teachers, 4 percent reported widespread disorder
in the classroom, 4 percent reported student racial/
ethnic tensions, and 3 percent reported student sexual
harassment of other students. Twenty percent of

  “At school” was defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on
school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events
or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school
hours or when school activities or events were in session.

public schools reported that gang activities had happened at all during 2007–08 and 3 percent reported
that cult or extremist activities had happened at all
during this period.
Discipline problems reported by public schools varied by school characteristics. In 2007–08, a higher
percentage of middle schools than primary schools
reported various types of discipline problems (figure
7.1). For example, 44 percent of middle schools
compared to 21 percent of primary schools reported
that student bullying occurred at least once a week.
Also, a higher percentage of middle schools than
high schools reported daily or weekly occurrences of
student bullying. A greater percentage of high schools
than middle schools reported any occurrence of gang
activities or cult or extremist group activities during
the school year.
In 2007–08, the percentage of schools reporting
discipline problems was generally smaller for schools
where 25 percent or less of the students were eligible
for free or reduced-price lunch than for schools where
76 percent or more of the students were eligible. For
example, 13 percent of schools where 76 percent or
more of the students were eligible for free or reducedprice lunch reported the daily or weekly occurrence
of student verbal abuse of teachers compared to 3
percent of schools where 25 percent or less of the
students were eligible. The percentage of students
eligible for free or reduced-price lunch programs is a
proxy measure of school poverty.

In 2007–08, a greater percentage of city schools than
suburban schools, town schools, or rural schools reported student verbal abuse of teachers, student acts
of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse,
widespread disorder in the classroom, and gang activities. For example, 8 percent of city schools compared
to 2 to 3 percent of suburban, town, or rural schools
reported widespread disorder in the classroom. During the same school year, in general, the percentage of
schools reporting discipline problems was higher in
larger schools than in smaller schools. For example,
52 percent of schools with 1,000 or more students
reported that gang activities occurred during the
school year compared to 10 to 22 percent of schools
with fewer than 1,000 students who reported this
discipline problem.

32

School Environment

The percentage of schools reporting that student verbal
abuse of teachers occurred at least once a week was
6 percent in 2007–08, lower than the percentage in
1999–2000 (13 percent). There were some measurable
changes in the percentage of public schools reporting
selected discipline problems between the two most
recent data collections, 2005–06 and 2007–08. A
smaller percentage of public schools reported cult or
extremist activities in 2007–08 (3 percent) than in
2005–06 (4 percent). However, a larger percentage
of public schools reported widespread disorder in
the classroom in 2007–08 than in 2005–06 (4 vs.
2 percent), and a larger percentage reported gang
activities in 2007–08 than in 2005–06 (20 vs.
17 percent).

Indicator 8
Students’ Reports of Gangs at School
In 2007, about 23 percent of students reported that gangs were present at their school.
Gangs are organized groups often involved in drugs,
weapons trafficking, and violence. Gangs at school
can be disruptive to the school environment because
their presence may incite fear among students and
increase the level of school violence (Laub and
Lauritsen 1998). In the School Crime Supplement to
the National Crime Victimization Survey, students
ages 12–18 were asked if gangs were present at their
school.24
In 2007, 23 percent of students reported that there
were gangs at their schools during the school year
(figure 8.1 and table 8.1). During the same year, a
greater percentage of male students (25 percent) than
female students (21 percent) reported a gang presence
at their schools. Overall, a smaller percentage of
White students (16 percent) and Asian students
(17 percent) reported a gang presence at school than
Black students (38 percent) and Hispanic students
(36 percent) in 2007.

Generally, a smaller percentage of 6th-, 7th-, and
8th-graders reported a gang presence at their school
than 9th-, 10th-, 11th-, and 12th-graders. In 2007,
between 15 and 21 percent of 6th-, 7th-, and 8thgraders reported a gang presence at school compared
to 24 to 28 percent of students in the higher grades.
In 2007, a higher percentage of students attending
public schools (25 percent) reported a gang presence
at school than students attending private schools
(5 percent).
The total percentage of students who reported the
presence of gangs at school was higher in 2005
(24 percent) than in 2003 (21 percent); however
there was no measurable change in the percentage of

Students’ Reports of Drug Availability on School Property
The percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them
decreased from 32 percent in 1995 to 23 percent in 2009.
In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades
9–12 were asked whether someone had offered, sold,
or given them an illegal drug on school property in
the 12 months before the survey.25 The percentage of
students in grades 9–12 who reported that drugs were
made available to them on school property increased
from 1993 to 1995 (from 24 to 32 percent), but
subsequently decreased to 23 percent in 2009 (table
9.1). There was no statistically significant difference,
however, between the 2009 percentage and the 2007
percentage (22 percent) (table 9.1 and figure 9.1).
Student reports of the availability of drugs on school
property varied by student characteristics. A higher
percentage of males than females reported that drugs
were offered, sold, or given to them on school property
in each survey year from 1993 to 2009 (figure 9.1
and table 9.1). For example, in 2009, 26 percent
of males reported that drugs were made available
to them, compared to 19 percent of females. There
were no measurable differences across grades in the
percentages of students reporting that drugs were
made available to them in 2009. Twenty-four percent
of 10th- and 11th-graders, 22 percent of 9th-graders
and 21 percent of 12th-graders reported that drugs
were made available to them.

The percentage of students who reported having
illegal drugs offered, sold, or given to them on school
property differed across racial/ethnic groups (figure
9.2 and table 9.1). Specifically, in 2009, higher
percentages of American Indian/Alaska Native
students (34 percent) and Hispanic students (31
percent) than Black students (22 percent), White
students (20 percent), and Asian students (18 percent)
reported that drugs were made available to them on
school property. In addition, a higher percentage of
students of two or more races (27 percent) than of
Asian students or White students reported that drugs
were made available to them on school property.
In 2009, student reports of the availability of drugs
on school property varied across the 42 states for
which data were available. Among these states, the
percentage of students reporting that drugs were
offered, sold, or given to them on school property
ranged from 15 percent in Kansas to 36 percent in
Hawaii and Nevada (table 9.2).

Students’ Reports of Being Called Hate-Related Words and Seeing
Hate-Related Graffiti
In 2007, 10 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that someone at school had used hate-related words
against them, and 35 percent had seen hate-related graffiti at school.
In the 2007 School Crime Supplement to the
National Crime Victimization Survey, students
ages 12–18 were asked if someone at school had
called them a derogatory word having to do with
their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, or
sexual orientation at school.26 Students were also
asked if they had seen hate-related graffiti at their
school—that is, hate-related words or symbols
written in classrooms, bathrooms, hallways, or on
the outside of the school building. With regard to
hate-related words, students were asked to specify the
characteristic to which the word was directed.27 In
2007, 10 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that
someone at school had used hate-related words against
them during the school year (figure 10.1 and table
10.1). Thirty-five percent of students reported seeing
hate-related graffiti at school during the school year.
In 2007, students’ experiences of being called
specific types of hate-related words and seeing
hate-related graffiti differed according to student
and school characteristics. For example, a smaller
percentage of 12th-graders (6 percent) reported
being targets of a hate-related word than 6th-graders
(12 percent); 7th-graders, 8th-graders, and 9th-graders
(11 percent each); and 10th-graders (9 percent).

A higher percentage of public school students than
private school students reported being called a
hate-related word (10 vs. 6 percent) and seeing haterelated graffiti (36 vs. 19 percent). In 2007, a higher
percentage of White students than Asian students
reported seeing hate-related graffiti. However, no
other measurable differences were found by race/
ethnicity or by sex in the percentages of students
who reported being called hate-related words or
seeing hate-related graffiti.
Between 2001 and 2007, the percentage of students
who reported being the target of a hate-related
word decreased from 12 to 10 percent. Between the
two most recent survey years, 2005 and 2007, the
percentage of students who reported being the target
of a hate-related word was lower in 2007 (10 percent)
than in 2005 (11 percent). There was no pattern of
increase or decrease in the percentage of students who
reported seeing hate-related graffiti between 1999
and 2007. However, the percentage of students who
reported seeing hate-related graffiti was smaller in
2007 (35 percent) than in 2005 (38 percent).

With regard to the specific characteristic to which the
hate-related word was directed, in 2007, 5 percent
of students reported hate-related words concerning
their race, 3 percent reported words related to their
ethnicity, 2 percent each reported words concerning
their religion or gender, and 1 percent each reported
words related to their disability or sexual orientation
(figure 10.2 and table 10.2).
Students’ experiences of being targets of specific types
of hate-related words in 2007 differed according to
their sex and race/ethnicity (table 10.2). A greater
percentage of female students than male students
(3 vs. 1 percent) reported being called a genderrelated hate word. However, a greater percentage
of male students than female students reported

being called hate-related words relating to race and
ethnicity. Five percent of male students compared to
4 percent of female students reported being targets
of a hate-related word regarding race and 4 percent
of male students compared to 2 percent of female
students reported being targets of a hate-related word
regarding ethnicity. A smaller percentage of White
students (3 percent) reported being called race-related
hate words than Black students (7 percent), Hispanic
students (6 percent), Asian students (11 percent),
and students from other race/ethnicities (8 percent).
Smaller percentages of both White students and Black
students (2 percent each) reported hate-related words
regarding their ethnicity than Hispanic and Asian
students (7 percent each).

Type of hate-related word
In the School Crime Supplement (SCS) questionnaire, students were asked if they had been the target of hate-related words at school. Students
who indicated that they had been called a hate-related word were asked to choose the specific characteristics that the hate-related word targeted.
Students were allowed to choose more than one characteristic. If a student chose more than one characteristic, he or she is counted once under
the “total” category. Therefore, the total percentage of students who reported being called a hate-related word is less than the sum of the students’
individual characteristics.									
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and going to and from school. Hate-related refers to derogatory
terms used by others in reference to students’ personal characteristics.

Indicator 11
Bullying at School and Cyber-Bullying Anywhere
In 2007, about 32 percent of 12- to 18-year-old students reported having been bullied at school during
the school year and 4 percent reported having been cyber-bullied.
Both bullying and being bullied at school are
associated with key violence-related behaviors,
including carrying weapons, fighting, and sustaining
injuries from fighting (Nansel et al. 2003). In the
2007 School Crime Supplement to the National
Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18
were asked if they had been bullied at school during
the school year and if they had been cyber-bullied
anywhere. Cyber-bullying is included as a point of
comparison and is distinct from bullying at school.28
In 2007, about 32 percent of students reported having
been bullied at school during the school year (figure
11.1 and table 11.1).29 Twenty-one percent of students
said that they had experienced bullying that consisted
of being made fun of; 18 percent reported being the
subject of rumors; 11 percent said that they were
pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; 6 percent said they
were threatened with harm; 5 percent said they were
excluded from activities on purpose; and 4 percent
each said that someone tried to make them do things
they did not want to do and that their property was
destroyed on purpose (figure 11.2 and table 11.1).
Of those students in 2007 who reported being bullied
during the school year, 79 percent said that they were
bullied inside the school, 23 percent said that they
were bullied outside on school grounds, 8 percent said
they were bullied on the school bus, and 4 percent
said they were bullied somewhere else (figure 11.3 and
table 11.2). Of students who reported being pushed,
shoved, tripped, or spit on, 19 percent reported being
injured as a result. Of these students who had been
bullied, 63 percent said that they had been bullied
once or twice during the school year, 21 percent
had experienced bullying once or twice a month, 10
percent reported being bullied once or twice a week,
and 7 percent said that they had been bullied almost
daily (figure 11.4 and table 11.3). Thirty-six percent

of students who were bullied notified a teacher or
another adult at school about the event(s).
In 2007, about 4 percent of students reported having
been cyber-bullied 30 anywhere (on or off school
property) during the school year (figure 11.1 and
table 11.1). Two percent of students said that they had
experienced cyber-bullying that consisted of another
student posting hurtful information about them
on the Internet; and 2 percent of students reported
unwanted contact, including being threatened or
insulted, via instant messaging by another student
during the school year (figure 11.2 and table 11.1).
Of the students in 2007 who reported cyber-bullying
during the school year, 73 percent said it had occurred
once or twice during that period, 21 percent said it
had occurred once or twice a month, and 5 percent
said it had occurred once or twice a week (figure 11.4
and table 11.3). Thirty percent of students who were
cyber-bullied notified a teacher or another adult at
school about the event(s).
Student reports of bullying and cyber-bullying varied
by student characteristics. A greater percentage of
female than male students reported being bullied
at school and cyber-bullied anywhere during the
school year (figure 11.1 and table 11.1). In 2007, 33
percent of female students reported being bullied
at school compared to 30 percent of male students.
Five percent of female students reported being cyberbullied anywhere compared to 2 percent of male
students. A higher percentage of White students (34
percent) reported being bullied at school in 2007
than Hispanic students (27 percent). In addition,
a higher percentage of White students (34 percent)
reported being bullied at school than Asian students
(18 percent).

Teachers’ Reports on School Conditions
In 2007–08, a greater percentage of public school teachers than private school teachers reported that student
misbehavior, student tardiness, and class cutting interfered with their teaching.
Classroom disruptions are associated with lower
student achievement for the offending student, as
well as for that student’s classmates (Lannie and
McCurdy 2007). In the Schools and Staffing Survey,
public and private school teachers were asked if
student misbehavior, student tardiness, and class
cutting interfered with their teaching. During the
2007–08 school year, 34 percent of teachers agreed
or strongly agreed that student misbehavior interfered
with their teaching, and 32 percent reported that
student tardiness and class cutting interfered with
their teaching (figure 12.1 and table 12.1). Teachers
were also asked whether school rules were enforced by
other teachers at their school, even for students not in
their classes, and whether they were enforced by the
principal. In 2007–08, 72 percent of teachers agreed
or strongly agreed that other teachers at their school
enforced the school rules, and 89 percent reported
that the principal enforced the school rules (figure
12.2 and table 12.2).
The percentage of teachers who reported that student
misbehavior, class cutting, and tardiness interfered
with their teaching varied by teacher and school
characteristics during 2007–08 (table 12.1). For
example, a greater percentage of public school teachers
than private school teachers reported that student
misbehavior (36 vs. 21 percent) and student tardiness
and class cutting (33 vs. 18 percent) interfered with
their teaching. And a higher percentage of secondary
school teachers than elementary school teachers
reported that student misbehavior (39 vs. 33 percent)
and student tardiness and class cutting (45 vs. 26
percent) interfered with their teaching.

A greater percentage of teachers in city schools
compared to teachers in suburban, town, or rural
schools reported that student misbehavior, tardiness,
and class cutting interfered with their teaching in
2007–08 (figure 12.1). Forty percent of teachers in
city schools, compared to 32 percent of teachers in
suburban schools, 34 percent of teachers in town
schools, and 31 percent of teachers in rural schools
reported that student misbehavior interfered with
their teaching. Thirty-eight percent of teachers in
city schools reported that student tardiness and class
cutting interfered with their teaching, compared to 29
percent of teachers in suburban schools, 32 percent of
teachers in town schools, and 27 percent of teachers
in rural schools who reported that these occurrences
interfered with their teaching.
The percentage of teachers who reported that student
misbehavior interfered with their teaching fluctuated
between 1987–88 and 1993–94; however, between
1993–94 and 2007–08 this percentage decreased
(from 41 to 34 percent). The percentage of teachers
reporting that student tardiness and class cutting
interfered with their teaching decreased between
1987–88 and 1993–94 (from 33 to 25 percent), but
increased between 1993–94 and 2007–08 (from 25
to 32 percent). There were no measurable differences
in the percentage of teachers reporting that student
misbehavior or tardiness and class cutting interfered
with their teaching between the two most recent
survey years, 2003–04 and 2007–08.

The percentage of teachers who agreed that school
rules were enforced by other teachers and by the
principal varied by teacher and school characteristics.
In every survey year, a higher percentage of elementary
school teachers than secondary school teachers agreed
that school rules were enforced by teachers and by the
principal in their school (table 12.2). In 2007–08,
79 percent of elementary teachers, compared to 56
percent of secondary teachers reported that school
rules were enforced by other teachers, and 89 percent
of elementary school teachers, compared to 86 percent
of secondary teachers, reported that school rules were
enforced by the principal.
Between 1987–88 and 2007–08, the percentage of
teachers who agreed that school rules were enforced
by other teachers fluctuated between 65 and 72
percent, and the percentage agreeing that rules were

measurable differences in the percentage of teachers
reporting that school rules were enforced by other
teachers or by the principal between the two most
recent survey years, 2003–04 and 2007–08.
In 2007– 08, the percentage of public school
teachers who agreed or strongly agreed that student
misbehavior and student tardiness and class cutting
interfered with their teaching and that school rules
are enforced by other teachers and by the principal,
varied among the 50 states and the District of
Columbia. For example, among these states and the
District of Columbia, the percentage of teachers who
reported that student misbehavior interfered with
their teaching ranged from 59 percent of teachers in
the District of Columbia to 29 percent of teachers in
Pennsylvania (table 12.3).

Indicator 13
Physical Fights on School Property and Anywhere
The percentage of students in grades 9 through 12 who reported being in a physical fight anywhere decreased
between 1993 and 2009, from 42 to 31 percent; this was also true for the percentage of students who
reported being in a physical fight on school property, this percentage decreased from 16 to 11 percent.
Physical fights on school property are considered
a high-risk behavior that may disrupt a focused
learning environment at school; and students
involved in physical fights on school property may
face difficulties succeeding in their studies (Payne,
Gottfredson, and Gottfredson 2003). In the Youth
Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9–12 were
asked about their general involvement in physical
fights (referred to as “anywhere” in this indicator)
during the preceding 12 months, as well as about their
involvement in physical fights on school property.31
Fights occurring anywhere are included as a point of
comparison with fights occurring on school property.
Overall, the percentage of students who reported
being in a physical fight anywhere decreased from
42 percent in 1993 to 31 percent in 2009. Similarly,
the percentage of students who reported being in a
physical fight on school property decreased between
1993 and 2009, from 16 to 11 percent (figure 13.1
and table 13.1). Between the two most recent survey
years, 2007 and 2009, the percentage of students in
grades 9–12 who reported being in a fight anywhere
decreased from 36 to 31 percent, but there was no
measurable difference between these two survey years
in the percentage of students who reported being in
a fight on school property.
Students were also asked how often they were in
physical fights during the past year. In 2009, 24
percent reported being in a fight one to three times,
5 percent were in a fight four to eleven times, and
3 percent were in a fight twelve or more times. Ten
percent of students reported being in a fight on school
property one to three times, 1 percent were in a fight
on school property four to eleven times, and less than
1 percent were in a fight on school property twelve
or more times (table 13.2).

From 1993 through 2009, the percentage of students
who reported being in a physical fight anywhere and
on school property decreased for all four grade levels
(grades 9 through12) (figure 13.1 and table 13.1).
Generally, a higher percentage of students in 9th
grade reported being in fights than students in any
other grade, both anywhere and on school property.
For example, in 2009, 37 percent of 9th-graders,
compared to 33 percent of 10th-graders, 29 percent of
11th-graders, and 25 percent of 12th-graders reported
being in a fight anywhere. Similarly, 15 percent of
9th-graders, compared to 12 percent of 10th-graders,
10 percent of 11th-graders, and 7 percent of 12thgraders reported being in a fight on school property
in 2009. A smaller percentage of 12th-graders were
involved in physical fights anywhere and on school
property than any other grade.
The percentage of students who reported being in
a physical fight differed by race/ethnicity in 2009
(figure 13.2 and table 13.1). Generally, a smaller
percentage of Asian students reported being in
physical fights anywhere and on school property
than other racial/ethnic groups. In addition, smaller
percentages of White students reported being
in fights anywhere and on school property than
Black, Hispanic, or American Indian/Alaska Native
students. For example, 19 percent of Asian students
reported being in a physical fight anywhere at least
once during the previous 12 months, compared to 28
percent of White students, 36 percent of Hispanic
students, 41 percent of Black students, and 42 percent
of American Indian/Alaska Native students. Eight
percent of Asian students reported being in a fight
on school property at least once during the previous
12 months, compared to 14 percent of Hispanic
students, 17 percent of Black students, and 21 percent
of American Indian/Alaska Native students.

For both males and females, the percentage of
students who reported being in a fight anywhere was
lower in 2009 than in 2007 (39 percent compared to
44 percent for males, and 23 percent compared to 27
percent for females). While the percentage of students
who reported being in fights on school property in
2009 was lower than in 2007 for females (7 percent
compared to 9 percent), there was no measurable
difference in the percentage who reported being
in fights on school property for males. A greater
percentage of males than females reported being in
a higher number of physical fights both anywhere
and on school property. For example, 4 percent of
males reported being in a fight twelve or more times

Data for 2009 were available for 41 states. Among
these states, the percentage of students who reported
being in a fight anywhere ranged from 23 percent
in Maine to 37 percent in New Mexico, while the

Indicator 14
Students Carrying Weapons on School Property and Anywhere
Between 1993 and 2009, the percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported carrying a weapon at
least one day anywhere during the past 30 days declined from 22 to 17 percent, and the percentage carrying
a weapon on school property declined from 12 to 6 percent.
The presence of weapons at school may interfere with
teaching and learning by creating an intimidating
and threatening atmosphere (Aspy et al. 2004). In
the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students were asked
if they had carried a weapon such as a gun, knife, or
club in the past 30 days (referred to as ‘anywhere’
in this report) or if they had carried one of these
weapons on school property during the same time
period.32 Weapon carrying anywhere is included
as a point of comparison with weapon carrying on
school property. In 2009, 17 percent of students in
grades 9–12 reported that they had carried a weapon
anywhere on at least one day during the past 30 days:
8 percent carried a weapon anywhere on six or more
days of the period, 6 percent carried a weapon on
two to five days of the period, and 4 percent carried
a weapon on one day of the period (tables 14.1 and
14.2). As for the percentages of students who reported
carrying a weapon on school property during the
past 30 days, 6 percent of students reported that
they had carried a weapon on at least one day of the
period. This percentage was composed of 2 percent
of students reporting carrying a weapon on school
property on six or more days, 1 percent reporting
carrying a weapon on two to five days, and 2 percent
reporting carrying a weapon on one day.
The percentage of students who reported carrying
a weapon anywhere in the past 30 days declined
from 22 percent in 1993 to 17 percent in 2009.
In addition, from 1993 to 2009 the percentage of
students who reported carrying a weapon on school
property declined from 12 to 6 percent. However,
the percentage of students who reported carrying a
weapon either anywhere or on school property was
statistically unchanged from 2007 to 2009.
In every survey year, the percentage of males who
reported they had carried a weapon, either anywhere
or on school property was higher than the percentage
of females doing so (figure 14.1 and table 14.1). In
2009, for example, 27 percent of males carried a
weapon anywhere, compared to 7 percent of females,
32

  “On school property” was not defined for survey
respondents.

and 8 percent of males carried a weapon on school
property, compared to 3 percent of females.
The percentage of students who reported carrying
a weapon anywhere or on school property varied
according to students’ race/ethnicity (figure 14.2
and table 14.1). In 2009, a smaller percentage of
Asian students (8 percent) than of students from any
other racial/ethnic group (the percentages for the
other groups ranged from 14 to 21 percent) reported
carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30
days. In addition, the percentage of White students
who reported carrying a weapon anywhere was higher
than that of Black students (19 vs. 14 percent). A
smaller percentage of Asian students (4 percent)
reported carrying a weapon on school property than
of Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students (10
percent), White students (6 percent), or Hispanic
students (6 percent).
In 2009, the percentages of 9th- through 12th-grade
students reporting carrying a weapon anywhere
during the past 30 days ranged from 16 to 18 percent,
whereas the percentages of 9th- through 12th-graders
reporting carrying a weapon on school property
during that time period ranged from 5 to 6 percent.
However, there were no significant differences in
the percentage of students who reported carrying
a weapon anywhere or on school property by grade
level.
State level data were available in 37 states for students
who reported carrying a weapon anywhere and in 41
states for students who reported carrying a weapon
on school property. In 2009, the percentage of
students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere
and on school property (varied among the states for
which data were available (table 14.3). Among these
states, the percentage of students reporting carrying
a weapon anywhere ranged from 10 percent in
New Jersey and Rhode Island to 27 percent in New
Mexico, while the percentage of students reporting
carrying a weapon on school property ranged from 3
percent in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin
to 12 percent in Wyoming.

This indicator has been updated to include 2009 data. For more information: Tables 14.1, 14.2, and 14.3 and Centers for Disease

Students’ Use of Alcohol on School Property and Anywhere
In 2009, about 42 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported having at least one drink of alcohol anywhere
in the past 30 days, while 4 percent had at least one drink on school property.
Alcohol consumption on school property is an illegal
behavior of students, that may lead to additional
crimes and misbehavior (Kodjo, Auinger, and
Ryan 2003). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey,
students in grades 9–12 were asked whether they had
consumed alcohol at all (referred to as “anywhere”
in this indicator) during the past 30 days and if
they had consumed alcohol on school property.33 In
most states, purchase and consumption of alcohol
anywhere publicly by students in grades 9–12 (as
they are under the legal drinking age of 21) is illegal.
Alcohol consumption anywhere is included as a
point of comparison with alcohol consumption on
school property. Overall, the percentage of students
reporting alcohol consumption anywhere in the past
30 days decreased from 48 percent in 1993 to 42
percent in 2009. The percentage of students reporting
alcohol consumption on school property in the past
30 days in 2009 was not measurably different from
the 1993 percentage (figure 15.1 and table 15.1).
In 2009, 20 percent of students in grades 9–12
reported using alcohol anywhere on one or two days
during the past 30 days. Twenty-one percent reported
using alcohol anywhere from three to twenty-nine
days during the past 30 days, and 1 percent reported
using alcohol anywhere all 30 days (table 15.2). In
addition, 3 percent of students reported using alcohol
on school property on one or two days during the
past 30 days, 1 percent of students reported using
alcohol on school property from three to twenty-nine
days during the past 30 days, and less than one-half
percent of students reported using alcohol on school
property all 30 days.
Since 2003, there has been no measurable difference
between the percentages of male and female students
who reported alcohol consumption anywhere (figure
15.1 and table 15.1). However, there were differences

in the reporting of how often alcohol was consumed
in 2009. For example, a higher percentage of females
than males reported consuming alcohol either one
or two days out of the previous 30 days in 2009 (23
percent vs. 18 percent). However, a higher percentage
of males than females reported consuming alcohol
from three to twenty-nine days (22 percent vs. 19
percent). One percent of male students reported
consuming alcohol anywhere all thirty days (figure
15.2 and table 15.2). In every survey year, a greater
percentage of males reported using alcohol on school
property than females (figure 15.1 and table 15.1).
For example, in 2009, 5 percent of males reported
consuming alcohol on school property at least one
time, whereas 4 percent of females did so. Two
percent of male students reported consuming alcohol
on school property from three to twenty-nine days
in 2009, whereas 1 percent of female students did so
(figure 15.2 and table 15.2).
In 2009, about one-half (52 percent) of 12th-graders
reported consuming alcohol anywhere at least one
time during the previous 30 days (figure 15.3 and
table 15.1). This percentage was higher than the
2009 percentage of 9th-graders (32 percent), 10thgraders (41 percent), and 11th-graders (46 percent)
who reported consuming alcohol anywhere at least
one time during the previous 30 days. There also
were differences in how often alcohol was consumed
anywhere among the grades in 2009 (table 15.2).
For example, a higher percentage of 12th-graders
(27 percent) than of 9th-graders (13 percent), 10thgraders (20 percent), and 11th-graders (23 percent)
reported consuming alcohol anywhere from three
to twenty-nine days in the past 30 days. In terms of
alcohol use on school property in 2009, there were
no measurable differences in alcohol consumption
among the grades.

Alcohol consumption anywhere and on school
property also varied by racial/ethnic group. In
2009, a smaller percentage of Asian students
than of students of any other racial/ethnic group
reported consuming alcohol anywhere (figure 15.4
and table 15.1). In addition, a smaller percentage of
Black students (33 percent) than of White students
(45 percent) and Hispanic students (43 percent)
reported consuming alcohol anywhere at least one
time during the previous 30 days. Asian students
were less likely to consume alcohol on school
property (3 percent) than Pacific Islander/Native
Hawaiian students (10 percent), Hispanic students
and students of two or more races (7 percent), and
Black students (5 percent); however there was no
measurable difference in the alcohol consumption on
school property of Asian students and White students
(3 percent each).

State level data were available in 42 states for students
who reported drinking alcohol anywhere and in 38
states for students who reported drinking alcohol
on school property. The percentage of students who
reported drinking alcohol anywhere and on school
property varied among the states for which data
were available. Among these states, the percentage
of students who reported drinking alcohol anywhere
at least one day during the previous 30 days ranged
from 18 percent in Utah to 47 percent in Louisiana,
while the percentage of students who reported
drinking on school property ranged from 3 percent

Indicator 16
Students’ Use of Marijuana on School Property and Anywhere
In 2009, 21 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported using marijuana anywhere at least one time in
the past 30 days, while 5 percent reported using marijuana at least one time on school property.
The Youth Risk Behavior Survey asked students in
grades 9–12 whether they had used marijuana at all
(referred to as “anywhere” in this indicator) in the past
30 days as well as whether they had used marijuana
on school property in the past 30 days.34 According
to students’ reports in 2009, students were four times
more likely to use marijuana anywhere than on school
property. Of students in grades 9–12, twenty-one
percent reported using marijuana at least one time
anywhere in the past 30 days, while 5 percent reported
using marijuana at least one time on school property
in the past 30 days (figure 16.1 and table 16.1).
The percentage of students who reported using
marijuana anywhere at least one time in the past 30
days was higher in 1999 (27 percent) than in 1993
(18 percent). Between 1999 and 2009, the percentage
of students who reported using marijuana anywhere
had declined to 21 percent. However, there was no
measurable difference between the percentage of
students who reported using marijuana anywhere
in 2005 and the percentage who reported using it
anywhere in 2009. With regard to marijuana use
on school property, the percentage of students who
reported using marijuana decreased between 1993
and 2009. In 1999, 7 percent of students reported
using marijuana at least one time during the past 30
days on school property, and by 2009 this percentage
had declined to 5 percent (figure 16.1 and table 16.1).
In every survey year, higher percentages of males
than females reported using marijuana anywhere
and on school property (figure 16.1 and table 16.1).
For example, in 2009, 23 percent of males reported
using marijuana anywhere during the previous 30
days, compared to 18 percent of females. According
to students’ reports, male students were twice as likely
as females to use marijuana on school property in
2009 (6 percent vs. 3 percent, respectively). There
were also differences between males and females in
the reported number of times using marijuana in
the past 30 days. Six percent of males reported using

marijuana 40 times or more anywhere in the past 30
days, compared to 2 percent of females. One percent
of males reported using marijuana 40 times or more
on school property, compared to less than one-half
percent of females (figure 16.2 and table 16.2).
Student reports on marijuana use anywhere and on
school property differed by racial/ethnic group in
2009. Generally, the percentage of Asian students
reporting using marijuana anywhere and on school
property during the previous 30 days was smaller
than that of most other racial/ethnic groups (figure
16.3 and table 16.1). For example, 7 percent of
Asian students reported using marijuana anywhere,
compared to 21 percent of White students; 22
percent each of Black students, Hispanic students,
and students of two or more races; 25 percent of
Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students; and 32
percent of American Indian/Alaska Native students.
Similarly, a smaller percentage of Asian students (2
percent) reported using marijuana on school property
than White students (4 percent), students of two or
more races (5 percent), Black students and Hispanic
students (6 percent each), and Pacific Islander/
Native Hawaiian students (9 percent). There was
no statistically significant difference between the
percentage of Asian students and the percentage of
American Indian/Alaska Native students reporting
using marijuana on school property.
The percentages of 9th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade
students, who reported using marijuana anywhere in
2009 were lower than the percentages of students in
those grades who used marijuana anywhere in 1999
(table 16.1). However, compared to a decade ago,
there was no significant change in the percentage of
11th-graders who reported using marijuana anywhere.
Lower percentages of students at each of grade levels
9 through 12 reported using marijuana on school
property in 2009 than in 1999.

Indicator 17
Students’ Perceptions of Personal Safety at School and Away
From School
In 2007, approximately 5 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they were afraid of attack or harm
at school, compared to 3 percent of students who reported that they were afraid of attack or harm away
from school.
School violence can make students fearful and affect
their readiness and ability to learn, and concerns
about vulnerability to attacks detract from a positive
school environment (Scheckner et al. 2002). In the
School Crime Supplement to the National Crime
Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked
how often35 they had been afraid of attack or harm
“at school or on the way to and from school” and
“away from school.”36 In 2007, a greater percentage of
students ages 12–18 reported that they were afraid of
attack or harm at school (5 percent) than away from
school (3 percent) during the school year (figure 17.1
and table 17.1).
Students’ reports on their fears about their safety
varied by location and race/ethnicity. For example,
in 2007, smaller percentages of White students
(4 percent) and Asian students (2 percent) reported
being afraid of attack or harm at school than their
Black (9 percent) and Hispanic (7 percent) peers.
Away from school, a smaller percentage of White
students (3 percent) than Black students (5 percent)
and Hispanic students (6 percent) reported being
afraid of attack or harm.
Other differences in students’ reports on their safety
were detected by student and school characteristics in
2007. For example, a higher percentage of 6th-graders
(10 percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm
at school than 7th-graders (7 percent), 8th-graders
(5 percent), 9th-graders (6 percent), 10th-graders
(5 percent), and 11th- and 12th-graders (3 percent

each). Away from school, a larger percentage of 6thgraders (6 percent) were afraid of attack or harm
than students in the 10th, 11th, or 12th grades
(2 to 3 percent).
A greater percentage of female students (6 percent)
feared for their safety at school than male students
(5 percent) in 2007. The same was true away from
school: 5 percent of females feared for their safety
compared to 2 percent of males.
School sector was also related to students’ fear of
attack or harm. A greater percentage of students in
public schools (6 percent) reported being afraid of
being attacked or harmed at school than students
attending private schools (2 percent). There was no
significant difference in the percentage of public and
private school students who reported being afraid of
attack or harm away from school.
Between 1995 and 2007, the percentage of students
who feared attack or harm at school decreased from
12 to 5 percent. Between the two most recent survey
years, 2005 and 2007, the percentage of students
who feared attack or harm at school decreased from
6 percent to 5 percent. Away from school, there was
no pattern of increase or decrease in the percentage
of students who feared attack or harm between 1999
and 2007. However, the percentage of students who
feared attack or harm away from school was smaller
in 2007 (3 percent) than in 2005 (5 percent).

35

  Students were asked if they “never,” “almost never,” “sometimes,” or “most of the time” feared attack or harm at school
or away from school. Students responding “sometimes” or
“most of the time” were considered fearful.
36
  “At school” includes the school building, on school
property, on a school bus.

Indicator 18
Students’ Reports of Avoiding School Activities or Specific Places
in School
In 2007, 7 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they avoided school activities or one or more places
in school because they thought someone might attack or harm them.
School crime may lead students to perceive school
as unsafe, and in trying to ensure their own safety,
students may begin to skip school activities or avoid
certain places in school (Schreck and Miller 2003).
The percentage of students who avoid school activities
and certain areas in school is a measure of their
perception of school safety. In the School Crime
Supplement to the National Crime Victimization
Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked whether they
had avoided school activities or one or more places
in school because they were fearful that someone
might attack or harm them.37 In 2007, 7 percent
of students reported that they had avoided a school
activity or one or more places in school during the
previous school year because of fear of attack or harm.
About 3 percent of students avoided a school activity,
and 6 percent avoided one or more places in school38
(figure 18.1 and table 18.1).
While there was no overall pattern of increase or
decrease between 1999 and 2007 in the percentage of
students who reported that they had avoided a school
activity or one or more places in school because they
were fearful that someone might attack or harm them,
the percentage was higher in 2007 (7 percent) than
in 2005 (6 percent).

37

  For the 2001 survey, the wording was changed from “attack or harm” to “attack or threat of attack.” See appendix A
for more information.
38
 “Avoided school activities” includes avoiding any (extracurricular) activities, skipping class, or staying home from
school. In 2007, the survey wording was changed from
“any extracurricular activities” to “any activities.” Please use
caution when comparing changes in this item over time.
Avoiding one or more places in school includes the entrance,
any hallways or stairs, parts of the cafeteria, restrooms, and
other places inside the school building.

In 2007, 2 percent of students reported that they had
avoided any activity, 1 percent of students reported
that they had avoided a class, and 1 percent of
students reported that they had stayed home from
school because they were fearful someone might
attack or harm them. One percent of students
reported that they had avoided the entrance to the
school, 3 percent that they had avoided the stairs or
hallways, 2 percent that they had avoided parts of the
school cafeteria, 3 percent that they had avoided any
school restrooms, and 1 percent that they had avoided
other places inside the school building because of fear
of attack or harm in 2007.
Students’ reports of avoiding one or more places
in school because of fear of attack or harm varied
by student and school characteristics. A higher
percentage of 7th-graders (7 percent), 8th-graders
(6 percent), 9th-graders (7 percent), and 10th-graders
(5 percent) reported avoiding one or more places
inside school than 12th-graders (3 percent) (figure
18.2). Additionally, a higher percentage of 6th-graders
(8 percent), 7th-graders (7 percent), and 9th-graders
(7 percent) than 11th-graders (4 percent) reported
avoiding one or more places in school because of
fear of attack or harm. No measurable difference was
detected in the extent to which females and males
avoided one or more places in school in 2007 (5 and
6 percent, respectively).
A larger percentage of public school students
(6 percent) than private school students (1 percent)
reported avoiding one or more places inside school
because of fear of attack or harm.

This indicator repeats information from the 2009 Indicators of School Crime and Safety report. For more information: Tables 18.1
and 18.2 and DeVoe and Bauer (2010), (http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2010/2010319.pdf).

Serious Disciplinary Actions Taken by Public Schools
Forty-six percent of public schools (approximately 38,500 schools) took a serious disciplinary action against
a student for specific offenses during the 2007–08 school year. Approximately 767,900 serious disciplinary
actions were taken by public schools during that period.
In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public
school principals were asked to report the number of
disciplinary actions their schools took against students
for specific offenses. The offenses included physical
attacks or fights; insubordination; distribution,
possession, or use of alcohol; distribution, possession,
or use of illegal drugs; use or possession of a firearm
or explosive device; and use or possession of a weapon
other than a firearm or explosive device.
Forty-six percent of public schools (approximately
38,500 schools) took at least one serious disciplinary
action against a student—including suspensions
lasting 5 days or more, removals with no services (i.e.,
expulsions), and transfers to specialized schools—for
specific offenses during the 2007–08 school year
(table 19.1).
The largest percentage of schools that reported taking
a disciplinary action in 2007–08 did so in response
to a physical attack or fight: 31 percent of schools
took a serious disciplinary action for physical attacks
or fights (figure 19.1 and table 19.1). In response to
other offenses, 21 percent of all schools took serious
disciplinary action for insubordination; 19 percent
for distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs;
15 percent took action as a result of use or possession
of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device;
10 percent did so for distribution, possession, or use
of alcohol; and 3 percent did so for use or possession
of a firearm or explosive device.
A total of 767,900 serious disciplinary actions
were taken during the 2007–08 school year. The
largest number of disciplinary actions were taken
for insubordination (327,100 actions) and physical

attacks or fights (271,800). A smaller number of
disciplinary actions were taken in response to the use
or possession of a firearm or explosive device (5,200
actions) than for other offenses covered in the survey.
Of the 767,900 serious disciplinary actions taken
during the 2007–08 school year, 76 percent were
suspensions for 5 days or more, 19 percent were
transfers to specialized schools, and 5 percent were
removals with no services for the remainder of the
school year (figure 19.2). Although the most common
disciplinary action taken was suspensions lasting 5
days or more, differences in serious disciplinary actions
taken varied by the type of offense. Generally, greater
percentages of out-of-school suspensions lasting 5
days or more were in response to insubordination
(82 percent); physical attacks or fights (79 percent);
and the distribution, possession, or use of alcohol (74
percent) than were in response to the other offenses
covered in the survey (ranging from 53 to 60 percent).
Greater percentages of removals with no services for
the remainder of the school year were in response to
the use or possession of a firearm or explosive device
(18 percent); distribution, possession, or use of illegal
drugs (9 percent); and use or possession of a weapon
other than a firearm or explosive device (8 percent)
than were in response to the other offenses covered
in the survey (ranging from 4 to 5 percent). Greater
percentages of transfers to specialized schools were
in response to the distribution, possession, or use of
illegal drugs (36 percent); the use or possession of
a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device
(32 percent); and the use or possession of firearm or
explosive device (29 percent) than were in response
to the other offenses covered in the survey (ranging
from 13 to 22 percent).

Although the overall percentage of schools taking a
serious disciplinary action was lower in 2003–04 (46
percent) than in 1999–2000 (54 percent), there has
been no measurable change since 2003–04 (figure
19.3 and table 19.2). This same general pattern held
both for the percentage of schools taking serious
disciplinary actions for the offense of physical attacks
or fights and for the offense of insubordination.

in the percentage of schools that took a serious
disciplinary action in response to the distribution,
possession, or use of alcohol or illegal drugs. A
smaller percentage of schools reported taking a
serious disciplinary action for the use or possession of
a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device in
2007–08 (15 percent) than in 2005–06 (19 percent).
Similarly, a smaller percentage of schools reported
taking a serious disciplinary action for the use or
possession of a firearm or explosive device in 2007–08
(3 percent) than in 2005–06 (5 percent).

Between the two most recent survey years (2005–06
and 2007–08), there was no measurable difference

Indicator 20
Safety and Security Measures Taken by Public Schools
During the 2007–08 school year, 43 percent of public schools reported that they had an electronic notification
system for a school-wide emergency and 31 percent of public schools reported that they had a structured,
anonymous threat reporting system.
Public schools use a variety of practices and
procedures intended to promote the safety of
students and staff. In the School Survey on Crime
and Safety, public school principals were asked about
their school’s use of safety and security measures
and procedures. Certain practices, such as locked
or monitored doors or gates, are intended to limit
or control access to school campuses, while others,
such as metal detectors, security cameras, and drug
sweeps, are intended to monitor or restrict students’
and visitors’ behavior on campus.
In the 2007–08 school year, nearly all public schools
required visitors to sign in or check in (99 percent)
(table 20.1). Other frequently reported safety and
security measures included prohibiting all tobacco
use on school grounds (91 percent of public schools)
and controlling access to school buildings by locking
or monitoring doors during school hours (90 percent
of public schools) (figure 20.1 and table 20.1). Fortythree percent of public schools reported that they
had an electronic notification system for a schoolwide emergency and 31 percent of public schools
reported that they had a structured, anonymous
threat reporting system. One percent of public schools
required students to pass through metal detectors daily.
The use of safety and security measures varied by
school level during the 2007–08 school year. In
general, a greater percentage of high schools than
middle schools and primary schools, and a greater
percentage of middle schools than primary schools,
reported using the following safety and security
measures: drug testing for athletes; drug testing for
students in extracurricular activities;39 requiring
students to wear badges or picture ID’s; daily metal
detector checks on students;40 random dog sniffs
to check for drugs;38 random sweeps for contraband;38,41 and security cameras to monitor school38
(table 20.2). For example, 19 percent of high schools,
14 percent of middle schools, and 3 percent of
39

  Students in extracurricular activities other than athletics.
  One or more check, sweep, or camera.
41
  For example, drugs or weapons. Does not include dog

40

primary schools reported that students were required
to wear badges or picture IDs. However, a smaller
percentage of high schools than middle or primary
schools reported controlling access to buildings
during school hours and requiring students to wear
uniforms. A greater percentage of middle schools
reported having an electronic notification system for
a school-wide emergency (49 percent) than primary
schools (43 percent) or high schools (44 percent).
In general, a higher percentage of schools with 1,000
or more students than schools with fewer students
reported the use of each safety and security measure
(the exceptions were controlling access to the building
during school hours, drug testing for students in
extracurricular activities, and requiring students to
wear uniforms). For example, 56 percent of schools
with 1,000 or more students had an electronic
notification system for a school wide emergency,
compared to 49 percent of schools with 500–999
students, 41 percent of schools with 300–499
students, and 31 percent of schools with less than
300 students.
The percentage of schools using various security
measures has changed over time. Between the
1999–2000 and 2007–08 school years, there was an
increase in the percentage of public schools reporting
the use of the following safety and security measures:
controlled access to the building during school
hours (from 75 to 90 percent); controlled access to
school grounds during school hours (from 34 to 43
percent); students required to wear badges or picture
IDs (from 4 to 8 percent); faculty required to wear
badges or picture IDs (from 25 to 58 percent); the use
of one or more security cameras to monitor school
(from 19 to 55 percent); the provision of telephones
in most classrooms (from 45 to 72 percent); and the
requirement that students wear uniforms (from 12
to 18 percent) (figure 20.2 and table 20.1). Between
the 2003–04 and 2007–08 school years, there was
an increase in the percentage of schools reporting
the drug testing of student athletes (from 4 to 6
percent) as well as an increase in the percentage of
schools reporting the drug testing of students in other
extracurricular activities (from 3 to 4 percent).

Indicator 21
Students’ Reports of Safety and Security Measures Observed at
School
Sixty-six percent of students reported observing the use of one or more security cameras at their school in
2007 compared to 58 percent of students in 2005.
Schools use a variety of measures to promote the
safety of students, ranging from codes of student
conduct to metal detectors. In the School Crime
Supplement42 to the National Crime Victimization
Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked whether their
school used certain security measures.43 Security
measures include metal detectors, locker checks,
security cameras, security guards or police officers,
adult supervision in hallways, badges or picture
identification for students, a code of student conduct,
locked entrance or exit doors during the day, and a
requirement that visitors sign in. In 2007, nearly all
students ages 12–18 observed the use of at least one of
the selected security measures at their school (figure
21.1 and table 21.1).
In 2007, the majority of students ages 12–18 reported
that their school had a code of student conduct (96
percent) and a requirement that visitors sign in (94
percent). Ninety percent of students reported the
presence of school staff or other adult supervision in
the hallway, and 69 percent reported the presence
of security guards and/or assigned police officers.
Fifty-four percent of students reported locker checks,
61 percent reported locked entrance or exit doors
during the day, and 66 percent reported the use
of security cameras at their schools. Twenty-four
percent of students reported that badges or picture
identification were required. Metal detectors were
the least observed of the selected safety and security
measures: 10 percent of students reported the use of
metal detectors at their school.

The percentage of students reporting the presence
of some of the selected security measures increased
between the two most recent survey years as well
as over longer time periods. For example, a greater
percentage of students reported observing the use
of one or more security cameras at their school in
2007 (66 percent) than in 2005 (58 percent). Over
the longer time period of 2001 through 2007, the
percentage of students who reported observing the
use of one or more security cameras at their school
increased from 39 to 66 percent. Similarly, a greater
percentage of students reported locked entrance or
exit doors during the day in 2007 (61 percent) than
in 2005 (54 percent). Over the longer time period of
1999 through 2007, the percentage of students who
reported locked entrance or exit doors during the day
increased from 38 to 61 percent.
In 2007, about 94 percent of students reported that
their school had a requirement that visitors sign
in compared to 93 percent of students in 2005.
Between 1999 and 2007, the percentage of students
who reported a visitor sign-in requirement increased
from 87 to 94 percent. No significant differences
were detected in the percentage of students who
reported metal detectors, locker checks, the presence
of security guards and/or assigned police officers,
requirements that students wear badges or picture
identification, or a code of student conduct in their
schools across all survey years.

  In 2005 and 2007, the unit response rate for this survey
did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret
the data with caution. For more information, please see appendix A.
43
  Readers should note that this indicator relies on student
reports of security measures and provides estimates based
on students’ awareness of the measure rather than on documented practice. See Indicator 20 for a summary of the use of
various security measures as reported by schools.

This indicator repeats information from the 2009 Indicators of School Crime and Safety report. For more information: Table 21.1

A school-associated violent death is defined as “a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal
injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States” while the victim was on the way to or from
regular sessions at school or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims include students, staff
members, and others who are not students, from July 1, 1992, through June 20, 2009.

Serious violent crimes are also included in violent crimes. 								
NOTE: There were changes in the sample design and survey methodology in the 2006 National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) that affected
survey estimates. Due to this redesign, 2006 data are not presented in this indicator. Data from 2007 onward are comparable to earlier years. For
more information, please see appendix A. Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes
include serious violent crimes and simple assault. Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all
attempted and completed thefts except motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which threat or use of force is involved. Total crimes
include violent crimes and theft. “At school” includes inside the school building, on school property, or on the way to or from school. Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on similar topics, the survey sources for these two indicators differ with respect to time coverage and administration. For more information on these two surveys, please see appendix A. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Estimates of number of
crimes are rounded to the nearest 100.

Serious violent crimes are also included in violent crimes.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian (prior to 2005), Pacific Islander,
and, from 2003 onward, two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be
made with caution.												
NOTE: Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and completed thefts except motor
vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which threat or use of force is involved. Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery,
and aggravated assault. Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and simple assault. Total crimes include violent crimes and theft. “At school”
includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. Due to a redesign of the methods used to measure urbanicity, estimates for 2007 locales are not shown. For more information, please see appendix A. Although Indicators 2 and
3 present information on similar topics, the survey sources for these two indicators differ with respect to time coverage and administration. For more
information on these two surveys, please see appendix A.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.									
2
The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995,
and 1997, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing two or
more races.

Theft/larceny includes taking things worth over $10 without personal confrontation. Please see appendix B for a more detailed definition.		
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At school” was
defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold schoolsponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school hours or when
school activities or events were in session. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Estimates of number of incidents are rounded to the
nearest 100.

Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of full-time-equivalent
(FTE) teachers and aides. The total number of FTE teachers and aides is a combination of full-time and part-time teachers and aides, including
special education teachers and aides, with an adjustment for part-time status.							
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At school” was
defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold schoolsponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school hours or when
school activities or events were in session. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Estimates of number of incidents and schools are
rounded to the nearest 100.

Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 8.
Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. High
schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades,
including K–12 schools.

Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of full-time-equivalent
(FTE) teachers and aides. The total number of FTE teachers and aides is a combination of the full-time and part-time teachers and aides, including
special education teachers and aides, with an adjustment for part-time status.							
NOTE: Violent incidents include rape or attempted rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, threat
of physical attack with or without a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon. Responses were provided by the principal or the person most
knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At school” was defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include
incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session.

Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 8. Middle
schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. High schools are
defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades, including K–12 schools.

Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of full-time-equivalent
(FTE) teachers and aides. The total number of FTE teachers and aides is a combination of the full-time and part-time teachers and aides, including
special education teachers and aides, with an adjustment for part-time status.							
5
Violent incidents include rape or attempted rape,, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, threat of physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon.						
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At school” was
defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold schoolsponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to respond only for those times that were during normal school hours or when school
activities or events were in session.

In 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period was the previous 6 months. Cognitive testing
showed that estimates from 2007 are comparable to previous years.								
2
Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian (prior to 2005), Pacific Islander,
and, from 2003 onward, two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be
made with caution.												
NOTE: Data for 2005 have been revised from previously published figures. All gangs, whether or not they are involved in violent or illegal activity,
are included. “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. Due to a redesign of the
methods used to measure urbanicity, estimates for 2007 locales are not shown. For more information, please see appendix A.

The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999, making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993,
1995, and 1997, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing
two or more races.

showed that estimates from 2007 are comparable to previous years.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian (prior to 2005), Pacific Islander,
and, from 2003 onward, two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be
made with caution.											
NOTE: Data for 2005 have been revised from previously published figures. “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school
bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. Hate-related refers to derogatory terms used by others in reference to students’ personal
characteristics. Due to a redesign of the methods used to measure urbanicity, estimates for 2007 locales are not shown. For more information,

In the School Crime Supplement (SCS) questionnaire, students were asked if they had been the target of hate-related words at school. Students
who indicated that they had been called a hate-related word were asked to choose the specific characteristics that the hate-related word targeted.
Students were allowed to choose more than one characteristic. If a student chose more than one characteristic, he or she is counted once under
the “total” category. Therefore, the total percentage of students who reported being called a hate-related word is less than the sum of the students’
individual characteristics.											
2
Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian (prior to 2005), Pacific Islander,
and, from 2003 onward, two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be
made with caution.											
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. Hate-related refers to derogatory
terms used by others in reference to students’ personal characteristics. Due to a redesign of the methods used to measure urbanicity, estimates for
2007 locales are not shown. For more information, please see appendix A.

Injury includes bruises or swelling; cuts, scratches, or scrapes; black eye or bloody nose; teeth chipped or knocked out; broken bones or internal
injuries; knocked unconscious; or other injuries. Only students who reported that their bullying incident constituted being pushed, shoved, tripped, or
spit on were asked if they suffered injuries as a result of the incident.								
2
Cyber-bullied includes students who responded that another student “made unwanted contact, for example, threatened or insulted [the respondent]
via text (SMS) messaging.” This category did not meet reporting standards to be reported separately.					
3
This was defined as another student making “unwanted contact, for example, threatened or insulted [the respondent] via instant messaging.”		
4
Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Pacific Islander, and two or more races. 	
NOTE: Table was revised on June 30, 2010. “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school.
Bullying types do not sum to total because students could have experienced more than one type of bullying. In 2007, the unit response rate for this
survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. For more information, please see appendix A.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, and, from 2003
onward, two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.	
NOTE: Table was revised on June 30, 2010. “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school.
In 2007, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. Detail may not sum to
totals because of rounding. For more information, please see appendix A.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. 									
2
The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995,
and 1997, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing two or
more races.												
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are
simply asked how many times in the last 12 months they have been in a physical fight.

NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are
simply asked how many times in the last 12 months they had been in a physical fight. The estimate for the United States is drawn from a nationally
representative sample of schools and is not the aggregate of participating states. Each state estimate is based on a sample that is representative of
that state.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.									
2
The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995,
and 1997, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing two or
more races.												
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students were
simply asked on how many days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days.

NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students
are simply asked how many days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days. The estimate for the United States is drawn from a nationally
representative sample of schools and is not the aggregate of participating states. Each state estimate is based on a sample that is representative
of that state.

The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995,
and 1997, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing two or
more races.

nationally representative sample of schools and is not the aggregate of participating states. Each state estimate is based on a sample that is representative of that state.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.

The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999, making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993,
1995, and 1997, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing
two or more races.												
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are
simply asked how many times during the past 30 days they used marijuana.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian (prior to 2005), Pacific Islander,
and, from 2003 onward, two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made
with caution.												
NOTE: Data for 2005 have been revised from previously published figures. “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school
bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. For the 2001 survey, the wording was changed from “attack or harm” to “attack or threat of
attack.” Students were asked if they “never,” “almost never,” “sometimes,” or “most of the time” feared attack or harm at school or away from school.
Students responding “sometimes” or “most of the time” were considered fearful. Fear of attack away from school was not collected in 1995. Due to a
redesign of the methods used to measure urbanicity, estimates for 2007 locales are not shown. For more information, please see appendix A.

NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. Serious disciplinary actions include removals with no continuing services for at least the remainder of the school year, transfers to specialized schools for disciplinary
reasons, and out-of-school suspensions lasting 5 or more days, but less than the remainder of the school year. Respondents were instructed to
respond only for those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified
otherwise. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Estimates of number of actions and schools are rounded to the nearest 100.

General Information
The indicators in this report are based on information
drawn from a variety of independent data sources,
including national surveys of students, teachers,
and principals, and data collections from federal
departments and agencies, including the Bureau of
Justice Statistics, the National Center for Education
Statistics, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Each data source has an independent sample design,
data collection method, and questionnaire design or
is the result of a universe data collection. Universe
data collections include a census of all known entities
in a specific universe (e.g., all deaths occurring on
school property). Readers should be cautious when
comparing data from different sources. Differences in
sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and
question phrasing can all affect the comparability of
results. For example, some questions from different
surveys may appear the same, but were asked of
different populations of students (e.g., students ages
12–18 or students in grades 9–12); in different years;
about experiences that occurred within different
periods of time (e.g., in the past 30 days or during
the past 12 months); or at different locations (e.g., in
school or anywhere).
All comparisons described in this report are
statistically significant at the .05 level. The primary
test procedure used in this report was Student’s t
statistic, which tests the difference between two
sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted
for multiple comparisons. Estimates displayed in the
text, figures, and tables are rounded from original
estimates, not from a series of rounding.
The following is a description of data sources,
accuracy of estimates, and statistical procedures used
in this report.

Sources of Data
This section briefly describes each of the datasets used
in this report: the School-Associated Violent Deaths
Surveillance Study, the Supplementary Homicide
Reports, the Web-based Injury Statistics Query
and Reporting System Fatal, the National Crime
Victimization Survey, the School Crime Supplement
to the National Crime Victimization Survey, the
Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the Schools and Staffing
Survey, and the School Survey on Crime and Safety.
Directions for obtaining more information are
provided at the end of each description.

Appendix A: Technical Notes

School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study
(SAVD)
The School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance
Study (SAVD) is an epidemiological study developed
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
conjunction with the U.S. Department of Education
and the U.S. Department of Justice. SAVD seeks to
describe the epidemiology of school-associated violent
deaths, identify common features of these deaths,
estimate the rate of school-associated violent death in
the United States, and identify potential risk factors
for these deaths. The surveillance system includes
descriptive data on all school-associated violent
deaths in the United States, including all homicides,
suicides , or legal intervention in which the fatal injury
occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary
or secondary school; while the victim was on the way
to or from regular sessions at such a school; or while
attending or on the way to or from an official schoolsponsored event. Victims of such events include
nonstudents, as well as students and staff members.
SAVD includes descriptive information about the
school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). The SAVD
Surveillance System has collected data from July 1,
1992, through the present.
SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and
collect data on school-associated violent deaths.
Cases are initially identified through a search of
the LexisNexis newspaper and media database.
Then law enforcement officials are contacted to
confirm the details of the case and to determine if
the event meets the case definition. Once a case is
confirmed, a law enforcement official and a school
official are interviewed regarding details about the
school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). A copy of
the full law enforcement report is also sought for each
case. The information obtained on schools includes
school demographics, attendance/absentee rates,
suspensions/expulsions and mobility, school history
of weapon-carrying incidents, security measures,
violence prevention activities, school response to the
event, and school policies about weapon carrying.
Event information includes the location of injury,
the context of injury (while classes were being held,
during break, etc.), motives for injury, method of
injury, and school and community events happening
around the time period. Information obtained on
victim(s) and offender(s) includes demographics,
circumstances of the event (date/time, alcohol or drug
use, number of persons involved), types and origins of
weapons, criminal history, psychological risk factors,
school-related problems, extracurricular activities,
and family history, including structure and stressors.

One hundred and five school-associated violent deaths
were identified from July 1, 1992, to June 30, 1994
(Kachur et al. 1996). A more recent report from
this data collection identified 253 school-associated
violent deaths between July 1, 1994, and June 30,
1999 (Anderson et al. 2001). Other publications from
this study have described how the number of events
change during the school year (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention 2001), the source of the
firearms used in these events (Reza et al. 2003), and
suicides that were associated with schools (Kauffman
et al. 2004). The most recent publication describes
trends in school associated homicide from July 1, 1992,
to June 30, 2006 (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention 2008). The interviews conducted on cases
between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1999, achieved
a response rate of 97 percent for police officials and
78 percent for school officials. For several reasons, all
data for years from 1999 to the present are flagged
as “subject to change”. For some recent data, the
interviews with school and law enforcement officials
to verify case details have not been completed. The
details learned during the interviews can occasionally
change the classification of a case. Also, new cases
may be identified because of the expansion of the
scope of the media files used for case identification.
Sometimes other cases not identified during earlier
data years using the independent case finding efforts
(which focus on nonmedia sources of information)
will be discovered. Also, other cases may occasionally
be identified while the law enforcement and school
interviews are being conducted to verify known cases.
For additional information about SAVD, contact:

by local law enforcement agencies participating in the
FBI’s UCR program. The data include murders and
nonnegligent manslaughters in the United States from
January 1976 to December 2008; that is, negligent
manslaughters and justifiable homicides have been
eliminated from the data. Based on law enforcement
agency reports, the FBI estimates that 644,554
murders (including nonnegligent manslaughters) were
committed from 1976 to 2008. Agencies provided
detailed information on 582,405 victims and 648,526
offenders.

Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting
System Fatal (WISQARS™ Fatal)

Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR)
The Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR),
which are a part of the Uniform Crime Reporting
(UCR) program, provide incident-level information
on criminal homicides, including situation (number
of victims to number of offenders); the age, sex, and
race of victims and offenders; types of weapons used;
circumstances of the incident; and the relationship
of the victim to the offender. The data are provided
monthly to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)

About 90 percent of homicides are included in the
SHR. However, adjustments can be made to the
weights to correct for missing reports. Estimates
from the SHR used in this report were generated by
the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) using a weight
developed by BJS that reconciles the counts of SHR
homicide victims with those in the UCR for the 1992
through 2005 data years. The weight is the same for
all cases for a given year. The weight represents the
ratio of the number of homicides reported in the UCR
to the number reported in the SHR. For additional

WISQARS Fatal provides mortality data related to
injury. The mortality data reported in WISQARS
Fatal come from death certificate data reported to
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data
include causes of death reported by attending
physicians, medical examiners, and coroners. It also
includes demographic information about decedents
reported by funeral directors, who obtain that information from family members and other informants.
NCHS collects, compiles, verifies, and prepares these
data for release to the public. The data provide information about what types of injuries are leading causes
of deaths, how common they are, and who they affect.
These data are intended for a broad audience—the
public, the media, public health practitioners and
researchers, and public health officials—to increase
their knowledge of injury.

National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS),
administered for the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics
by the U.S. Census Bureau, is the nation’s primary
source of information on crime and the victims of
crime. Initiated in 1972 and redesigned in 1992,
the NCVS collects detailed information annually
on the frequency and nature of the crimes of rape,
sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault,
theft, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft
experienced by Americans and their households each
year. The survey measures both crimes reported to
police and crimes not reported to the police.
Readers should note that in 2003, in accordance with
changes to the Office of Management and Budget’s
standards for the classification of federal data on race
and ethnicity, the NCVS item on race/ethnicity was
modified. A question on Hispanic origin is followed
by a question on race. The new question about race
allows the respondent to choose more than one race
and delineates Asian as a separate category from
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Analysis
conducted by the Demographic Surveys Division at
the U.S. Census Bureau showed that the new question
had very little impact on the aggregate racial distribution of the NCVS respondents, with one exception.
There was a 1.6 percentage point decrease in the
percentage of respondents who reported themselves
as White. Due to changes in race/ethnicity categories,
comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be
made with caution.
There were changes in the sample design and survey
methodology in the 2006 National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) that impacted survey estimates.
Due to this redesign, 2006 data are not presented in
this indicator. Data from 2007 onward are comparable to earlier years. Analysis of the 2007 estimates
160

Appendix A: Technical Notes

indicate that the program changes made in 2007 had
relatively small effects on NCVS changes. As discussed
in Criminal Victimization, 2006 the substantial
increases in victimization rates from 2005 to 2006
do not appear to be due to actual changes in crime
during that period. The increases were attributed to
the impact of methodological changes in the survey.

cv06tn.pdf. The number of NCVS eligible households
in sample in 2008 was about 42,000. They were
selected using a stratified, multistage cluster design.
In the first stage, the primary sampling units (PSUs),
consisting of counties or groups of counties, were
selected. In the second stage, smaller areas, called
Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected from
each sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs,
clusters of four households, called segments, were
selected for interview. At each stage, the selection
was done proportionate to population size in
order to create a self-weighting sample. The final
sample was augmented to account for households
constructed after the decennial Census. Within each
sampled household, U.S. Census Bureau personnel
interviewed all household members age 12 and older
to determine whether they had been victimized by
the measured crimes during the 6 months preceding
the interview.
The first NCVS interview with a housing unit is
conducted in person. Subsequent interviews are
conducted by telephone, if possible. About 67,000
persons age 12 and older are interviewed each 6
months. Households remain in the sample for 3
years and are interviewed seven times at 6-month
intervals. Since the survey’s inception, the initial
interview at each sample unit has been used only to
bound future interviews to establish a time frame
to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered in these
subsequent interviews. Beginning in 2006, data from
the initial interview have been adjusted to account for
the effects of bounding and included in the survey
estimates. After their seventh interview, households
are replaced by new sample households. The NCVS
has consistently obtained a response rate of over 90
percent at the household level. The completion rates
for persons within households in 2008 were about 86
percent. Weights were developed to permit estimates
for the total U.S. population 12 years and older. For

School Crime Supplement (SCS)
Created as a supplement to the NCVS and codesigned
by the National Center for Education Statistics
and Bureau of Justice Statistics, the School Crime
Supplement (SCS) survey was conducted in 1989,
1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007 to collect
additional information about school-related victimizations on a national level. This report includes data
from the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007
collections. The 1989 data are not included in this
report as a result of methodological changes to the
NCVS and SCS. The survey was designed to assist
policymakers as well as academic researchers and
practitioners at the federal, state, and local levels so
that they can make informed decisions concerning
crime in schools. The SCS asks students a number
of key questions about their experiences with and
perceptions of crime and violence that occurred inside
their school, on school grounds, on a school bus, or
on the way to or from school. Additional questions
not included in the NCVS were also added to the
SCS, such as those concerning preventive measures
used by the school, students’ participation in after
school activities, students’ perceptions of school rules,
the presence of weapons and gangs in school, the
presence of hate-related words and graffiti in school,
student reports of bullying and reports of rejection
at school, and the availability of drugs and alcohol in
school, as well as attitudinal questions relating to fear
of victimization and avoidance behavior at school.
In all SCS survey years through 2005, the SCS was
conducted for a 6-month period from January to
June in all households selected for the NCVS (see
discussion above for information about the NCVS
sampling design and changes to the race/ethnicity
item made for 2003 onward). It should be noted that
the initial NCVS interview has always been included
in the SCS data collection. Within these households,
the eligible respondents for the SCS were those
household members who had attended school at any
time during the 6 months preceding the interview,
were enrolled in grades 6–12, and were not home
schooled. In 2007, the questionnaire was changed and
household members who attended school any time
during the school year were included. The age range
of students covered in this report is 12–18 years of
age. Eligible respondents were asked the supplemental

questions in the SCS only after completing their entire
NCVS interview.
The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999, 2001,
2003, 2005, and 2007 was calculated by using NCVS
incident variables appended to the 1995, 1999, 2001,
2003, 2005, and 2007 SCS data ﬁles. The NCVS type
of crime variable was used to classify victimizations
of students in the SCS as serious violent, violent, or
theft. The NCVS variables asking where the incident
happened and what the victim was doing when it
happened were used to ascertain whether the incident
happened at school. For prevalence of victimization,
the NCVS definition of “at school” includes in the
school building, on school property, or on the way to
or from school. Only incidents that occurred inside
the United States are included.
In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modified
from previous collections. First, in 1995 and 1999, “at
school” was defined for respondents as in the school
building, on the school grounds, or on a school bus.
In 2001, the definition for “at school” was changed
to mean in the school building, on school property,
on a school bus, or going to and from school. This
change was made to the 2001 questionnaire in order
to be consistent with the definition of “at school” as
it is constructed in the NCVS and was also used as
the definition in 2003, 2005, and 2007. Cognitive
interviews conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on
the 1999 SCS suggested that modifications to the
definition of “at school” would not have a substantial
impact on the estimates.
A total of 9,700 students participated in the 1995
SCS, 8,400 in 1999, 8,400 in 2001, 7,200 in 2003,
6,300 in 2005, and 5,600 in 2007. In the 2007
SCS, the household completion rate was 90 percent.
In the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 SCS, the
household completion rates were 95 percent, 94
percent, 93 percent, 92 percent, and 91 percent,
respectively, and the student completion rates were 78
percent, 78 percent, 77 percent, 70 percent, and 62
percent respectively. For the 2007 SCS, the student
completion rate was 58 percent.
Thus, the overall unweighted SCS response rate
(calculated by multiplying the household completion rate by the student completion rate) was 74
percent in 1995, 73 percent in 1999, 72 percent in
2001, 64 percent in 2003, 56 percent in 2005, and
53 percent in 2007. Response rates for most survey
items were high—typically over 95 percent of all
eligible respondents. The weights were developed to
compensate for differential probabilities of selection
and nonresponse. The weighted data permit inferIndicators of School Crime and Safety: 2010

161

ences about the eligible student population who were
enrolled in schools in 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005,
and 2007.
Due to the low unit response rate in 2005 and 2007,
a unit nonresponse bias analysis was done. There are
two types of nonresponse: unit and item nonresponse.
Unit response rates indicate how many sampled units
have completed interviews. Because interviews with
students could only be completed after households
had responded to the NCVS, the unit completion
rate for the SCS reflects both the household interview
completion rate and the student interview completion
rate. Nonresponse can greatly affect the strength
and application of survey data by leading to an
increase in variance as a result of a reduction in the
actual size of the sample and can produce bias if the
nonrespondents have characteristics of interest that
are different from the respondents. Furthermore,
imputation, a common recourse to nonresponse,
can lead to the risk of underestimating the sampling
error if imputed data are treated as though they were
observed data.
In order for response bias to occur, respondents
must have different response rates and responses to
particular survey variables. The magnitude of unit
nonresponse bias is determined by the response
rate and the differences between respondents and
nonrespondents on key survey variables. Although the
bias analysis cannot measure response bias since the
SCS is a sample survey and it is not known how the
population would have responded, the SCS sampling
frame has four key student or school characteristic
variables for which data is known for respondents
and nonrespondents: sex, race/ethnicity, household
income, and urbanicity, all of which are associated
with student victimization. To the extent that there
are differential responses by respondents in these
groups, nonresponse bias is a concern.
In 2005, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of bias for the race, household income, and
urbanicity variables. White (non-Hispanic) and Other
(non-Hispanic) respondents had higher response
rates than Black (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic
respondents. Respondents from households with an
income of $35,000–$49,999 and $50,000 or more
had higher response rates than those from households
with incomes of less than $7,500, $7,500–$14,999,
$15,000–$24,999 and $25,000–$34,999. Respondents who live in urban areas had lower response
rates than those who live in rural or suburban areas.
Although the extent of nonresponse bias cannot be
determined, weighting adjustments, which corrected

162

Appendix A: Technical Notes

for differential response rates, should have reduced
the problem.
In 2007, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias
found evidence of bias by the race/ethnicity and
household income variables. Hispanic respondents
had lower response rates than other race/ethnicities.
Respondents from households with an income of
$25,000 or more had higher response rates than those
from households with incomes of less than $25,000.
However, when responding students are compared to
the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable
differences between the responding students and the
eligible students, suggesting the nonresponse bias has
little impact on the overall estimates.

Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)
The National School-Based Youth Risk Behavior
Survey (YRBS) is one component of the Youth
Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), an
epidemiological surveillance system developed by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
to monitor the prevalence of youth behaviors that
most influence health. The YRBS focuses on priority
health-risk behaviors established during youth that
result in the most significant mortality, morbidity,
disability, and social problems during both youth
and adulthood. This report uses 1993, 1995, 1997,
1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009 YRBS data.
The YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling
design to produce a nationally representative sample
of students in grades 9–12 in the United States.
The target population consisted of all public and
private school students in grades 9–12 in the 50
states and the District of Columbia. The first-stage
sampling frame included selecting primary sampling
units (PSUs) from strata formed on the basis of
urbanization and the relative percentage of Black
and Hispanic students in the PSU. These PSUs are
either counties; subareas of large counties; or groups
of smaller, adjacent counties. At the second stage,
schools were selected with probability proportional
to school enrollment size.

The final stage of sampling consisted of randomly
selecting, in each chosen school and in each of
grades 9–12, one or two classrooms from either a
required subject, such as English or social studies,
or a required period, such as homeroom or second
period. All students in selected classes were eligible to
participate. Three strategies were used to oversample
Black and Hispanic students: (1) larger sampling rates
were used to select PSUs that are in high-Black and
high-Hispanic strata; (2) a modified measure of size
was used that increased the probability of selecting
schools with a disproportionately high percentage of
combined Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or
American Indian/Alaska Native enrollment; and (3)
two classes per grade, rather than one, were selected
in schools with a high percentage of combined Black,
Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/
Alaska Native enrollment. Approximately 16,300,
10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, 15,200, 13,900,
14,000, and 16,400 students participated in the 1993,
1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009
surveys, respectively.
The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993
survey, 60 percent for the 1995 survey, 69 percent for
the 1997 survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey, 63
percent for the 2001 survey, 67 percent for the 2003
survey, 67 percent for the 2005 survey, 68 percent
for the 2007 survey, and 71 percent for the 2009
survey. NCES standards call for response rates of 85
percent or better for cross-sectional surveys, and bias
analyses are required by NCES when that percentage
is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full nonresponse
bias analysis has not been done because the data
necessary to do the analysis are not available. The
weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse and
the oversampling of Black and Hispanic students in
the sample. The final weights were constructed so that
only weighted proportions of students (not weighted
counts of students) in each grade matched national
population projections.
State-level data were downloaded from the Youth
Online: Comprehensive Results web page. Each state
and local school-based YRBS employs a two-stage,
cluster sample design to produce representative samples
of students in grades 9–12 in their jurisdiction. All
except a few state and local samples include only
public schools, and each local sample includes only
schools in the funded school district (e.g., San Diego
Unified School District) rather than in the entire city
(e.g., greater San Diego area).

In the first sampling stage in all except a few states
and districts, schools are selected with probability
proportional to school enrollment size. In the second
sampling stage, intact classes of a required subject
or intact classes during a required period (e.g.,
second period) are selected randomly. All students
in sampled classes are eligible to participate. Certain
states and districts modify these procedures to meet
their individual needs. For example, in a given
state or district, all schools, rather than a sample
of schools, might be selected to participate. State
and local surveys that have a scientifically selected
sample, appropriate documentation, and an overall
response rate greater than or equal to 60 percent are
weighted. The overall response rate reflects the school
response rate multiplied by the student response rate.
These three criteria are used to ensure that the data
from those surveys can be considered representative
of students in grades 9–12 in that jurisdiction. A
weight is applied to each record to adjust for student
nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade,
sex, and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore,
weighted estimates are representative of all students
in grades 9–12 attending schools in each jurisdiction.
Surveys that do not have an overall response rate of
greater than or equal to 60 percent and that do not
have appropriate documentation are not weighted and
are not included in this report.
In 2009, a total of 42 states and 20 districts had
weighted data. In sites with weighted data, the student
sample sizes for the state and local YRBS ranged from
965 to 14,870. School response rates ranged from 73
to 100 percent, student response rates ranged from
61 to 90 percent, and overall response rates ranged
from 60 to 94 percent.
Readers should note that reports of these data
published by the CDC and in this report do not
include percentages where the denominator includes
less than 100 unweighted cases.
In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office
of Management and Budget’s standards for the
classification of federal data on race and ethnicity,
the YRBS item on race/ethnicity was modified. The
version of the race and ethnicity question used in
1993, 1995, and 1997 was:

In the 2005 national survey and in all 2007 and
2009 surveys, race/ethnicity was computed from two
questions: (1) “Are you Hispanic or Latino?” (response
options were “yes” and “no”), and (2) “What is your
race?” (response options were “American Indian or
Alaska Native,” “Asian,” “Black or African American,”
“Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,” or
“White”). For the second question, students could
select more than one response option. For this
report, students were classified as “Hispanic” if they
answered “yes” to the first question, regardless of
how they answered the second question. Students
who answered “no” to the first question and selected
more than one race/ethnicity in the second category
were classified as “More than one race.” Students
who answered “no” to the first question and selected
only one race/ethnicity were classified as that race/
ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was classified as missing for
students who did not answer the first question and
for students who answered “no” to the first question
but did not answer the second question.
CDC has conducted two studies to understand the
effect of changing the race/ethnicity item on the
YRBS. Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found
that allowing students to select more than one
response to a single race/ethnicity question on the
YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/
ethnicity among high school students. Eaton, Brener,
Kann, and Pittman (2007) found that self-reported
race/ethnicity was similar regardless of whether the
single-question or a two-question format was used.

Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS)
This report draws upon data on teacher victimization
from the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS),
which provides national- and state-level data on
public schools and national- and affiliation-level
data on private schools. The 1993–94, 1999–2000,
2003–04, and 2007–08 SASS were collected by the
U.S. Census Bureau and sponsored by the National
Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The
1993–94, 1999–2000, and 2003–04 administrations
of SASS consisted of four sets of linked surveys,
including surveys of schools, the principals of each
selected school, a subsample of teachers within each
school, and public school districts. The 2007–08
administration of SASS consisted of five types of
questionnaires: district questionnaires, principal
questionnaires, school questionnaires, teacher
questionnaires, and school library media center
questionnaires. In 1993–94, there were two sets of
teacher surveys, public and private school teachers. In
1999–2000, there were four sets of teacher surveys,
public, private, public charter, and Bureau of Indian
Education (BIE) school teachers. In 2003–04 and
2007–08, there were three sets of teacher surveys,
public (including public charter), private, and BIE.
For this report, BIE and public charter schools are
included with public schools.
The public school sampling frames for the 1993–94,
1999–2000, 2003–04, and 2007–08 SASS were
created using the 1991–92, 1997–98, 2001–02, and
2005–06 NCES Common Core of Data (CCD)
Public School Universe Files, respectively. In SASS,
a school was defined as an institution or part of
an institution that provides classroom instruction
to students; has one or more teachers to provide
instruction; serves students in one or more of grades
1–12 or the ungraded equivalent and is located in one
or more buildings apart from a private home. It was
possible for two or more schools to share the same

building; in this case they were treated as different
schools if they had different administrations (i.e.,
principals or school head). Since CCD and SASS
differ in scope and their definition of a school, some
records were deleted, added, or modified in order to
provide better coverage and a more efficient sample
design for SASS. Data were collected by multistage
sampling, which began with the selection of schools.

school teachers (who are included with public school
teachers). For private school teachers, the overall
weighted response rates were 80 percent in 1993–94,
67 percent in 1999–2000, 70 percent in 2003–04,
and 66 percent in 2007–08. Values were imputed for
questionnaire items that should have been answered
but were not. For additional information about SASS,
contact:

This report uses 1993–94, 1999–2000, 2003–04,
and 2007–08 SASS data. Approximately 10,000
public schools and 3,300 private schools were selected
to participate in the 1993–94 SASS, 11,100 public
schools (9,900 public schools, 100 BIE-funded
schools, and 1,100 charter schools) and 3,600
private schools were selected to participate in the
1999–2000 SASS, 10,400 public schools (10,200
public schools and 200 BIE-funded schools) and
3,600 private schools were selected to participate in
the 2003–04 SASS, and 9,980 public schools (9,800
public schools and 180 BIE-funded schools) and
2,940 private schools were selected to participate in
the 2007–08 SASS. Within each school, teachers
selected were further stratified into one of five teacher
types in the following hierarchy: (1) Asian or Pacific
Islander; (2) American Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; (3)
teachers who teach classes designed for students with
limited English proficiency; (4) teachers in their first,
second, or third year of teaching; and (5) teachers not
classified in any of the other groups. Within each
teacher stratum, teachers were selected systematically
with equal probability. In 1993–94, approximately
57,000 public school teachers and 11,500 private
school teachers were sampled. In 1999– 2000, 56,300
public school teachers, 500 BIE teachers, 4,400 public
charter school teachers, and 10,800 private school
teachers were sampled. In 2003–04, 52,500 public
school teachers, 700 BIE teachers, and 10,000 private
school teachers were sampled. In 2007–08, 47,440
public school teachers, 750 BIE teachers, and 8,180
private school teachers were sampled.

This report focuses on responses from teachers. The
overall weighted response rate for public school
teachers in 1993–94 was 88 percent. In 1999–2000,
the overall weighted response rates were 77 percent for
public school teachers, and 86 and 72 percent for BIE
and public charter school teachers, respectively (which
are included with public school teachers for this
report). In 2003–04, the overall weighted response
rates were 76 percent for public school teachers and
86 percent for BIE-funded school teachers (who are
included with public school teachers). In 2007–08,
the overall weighted response rates were 72 percent for
public school teachers and 71 percent for BIE-funded

School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)
The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)
is managed by the National Center for Education
Statistics (NCES) on behalf of the U.S. Department
of Education. SSOCS collects extensive crime and
safety data from principals and school administrators
of U.S. public schools. Data from this collection can
be used to examine the relationship between school
characteristics and violent and serious violent crimes
in primary schools, middle schools, high schools, and
combined schools. In addition, data from SSOCS can
be used to assess what crime prevention programs,
practices, and policies are used by schools. SSOCS
has been conducted in school years 1999–2000,
2003–04, 2005–06, and 2007–08. A fifth collection
is planned for school year 2009–10.
SSOCS was developed by NCES and is funded by
the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools of the U.S.
Department of Education. The 2007–08 SSOCS
(SSOCS:2008) was conducted by the U.S. Census
Bureau. Data collection began on February 25, 2008,
when questionnaire packets were mailed to sampled
schools, and continued through June 18, 2008. A total
of 2,560 public schools submitted usable questionnaires: 618 primary schools, 897 middle schools, 936
high schools, and 109 combined schools.
The sampling frame for SSOCS:2008 was constructed
from the public school universe file created for the
2007–08 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). The
SASS frame was derived from the 2005–06 Common
Core of Data (CCD) Public Elementary/Secondary
School Universe data file. Certain types of schools
were excluded from the CCD file in order to meet
the sampling needs of SASS: those in U.S. outlying

areas1 and Puerto Rico, overseas Department of
Defense schools, newly closed schools, home schools,
and schools with a high grade of kindergarten
or lower. Additional schools were then excluded
from the SASS frame to meet the sampling needs
of SSOCS: special education schools, vocational
schools, alternative schools (e.g., adult continuing
education schools and remedial schools), ungraded
schools, schools sponsored by the Bureau of Indian
Education, and other “nonregular” schools.2 Charter
schools were not excluded. The use of the modified
SASS sampling frame for SSOCS:2008 is consistent
with the 1999–2000 SSOCS (SSOCS:2000) and
the 2003–04 SSOCS (SSOCS:2004). The 2005–06
SSOCS (SSOCS:2006) deviated from this by using
the CCD directly as a sampling frame. This deviation was necessary because SSOCS:2006 occurred
between SASS collections.
A total of 3,484 schools were selected for the 2008
study. In February 2008, questionnaires were mailed
to school principals, who were asked to complete the
survey or to have it completed by the person most
knowledgeable about discipline issues at the school.
A total of 2,560 schools completed the survey. The
weighted overall response rate was 77.2 percent. A
nonresponse bias analysis was conducted on the 13
items with weighted item nonresponse rates below 85
percent. The detected bias was not deemed problematic enough to suppress any items from the data file.
Weights were developed to adjust for the variable
probabilities of selection and differential nonresponse
and can be used to produce national estimates for
regular public schools in the 2007–08 school year. For
information on the 1999–2000, 2003–04, 2005–06,
and 2007–08 iterations, see Neiman and DeVoe

Appendix A: Technical Notes

Accuracy of Estimates

The accuracy of any statistic is determined by the joint
effects of nonsampling and sampling errors. Both
types of error affect the estimates presented in this
report. Several sources can contribute to nonsampling
errors. For example, members of the population of
interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling
frame; sampled members refuse to answer some of
the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of
the survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse);
mistakes are made during data editing, coding,
or entry; the responses that respondents provide
differ from the “true” responses; or measurement
instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail
to measure the characteristics they are intended
to measure. Although nonsampling errors due to
questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced
somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and
imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling
errors or gauging the effects of these errors is usually
difficult.
Sampling errors occur because observations are
made on samples rather than on entire populations.
Surveys of population universes are not subject
to sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample
will differ somewhat from those that would have
been obtained by a complete census of the relevant
population using the same survey instruments,
instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a
statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling;
it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in
a particular sample. In addition, the standard errors
for two sample statistics can be used to estimate the
precision of the difference between the two statistics
and to help determine whether the difference based
on the sample is large enough so that it represents the
population difference.
Most of the data used in this report were obtained
from complex sampling designs rather than a simple
random design. The features of complex sampling
require different techniques to calculate standard
errors than are used for data collected using a simple
random sampling. Therefore, calculation of standard
errors requires procedures that are markedly different
from the ones used when the data are from a simple
random sample. The Taylor series approximation
technique or the balanced repeated replication (BRR)
method was used to estimate most of the statistics
and their standard errors in this report.
Standard error calculation for data from the School
Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series
approximation method using PSU and strata variables
available from each dataset. For statistics based on

all years of NCVS data, standard errors were derived
from a formula developed by the U.S. Census Bureau,
which consists of three generalized variance function
(gvf) constant parameters that represent the curve
fitted to the individual standard errors calculated
using the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique.

tables of values at certain critical levels, called
alpha levels. For this report, an alpha value of .05
was used, which has a t value of 1.96. If the t value
was larger than 1.96, then the difference between
the two estimates is statistically significant at the
95 percent level.

The coefficient of variation (CV ) represents the ratio
of the standard error to the mean. As an attribute
of a distribution, the CV is an important measure of
the reliability and accuracy of an estimate. In this
report, the CV was calculated for all estimates, and
in cases where the CV was at least 30 percent the
estimates were noted with a ! symbol (interpret data
with caution). In cases where the CV was greater than
50 percent, the estimate was determined not to meet
reporting standards and was suppressed.

A linear trend test was used when differences among
percentages were examined relative to ordered
categories of a variable, rather than the differences
between two discrete categories. This test allows one
to examine whether, for example, the percentage of
students using drugs increased (or decreased) over
time or whether the percentage of students who
reported being physically attacked in school increased
(or decreased) with their age. Based on a regression
with, for example, student’s age as the independent
variable and whether a student was physically attacked
as the dependent variable, the test involves computing
the regression coefficient (b) and its corresponding
standard error (se). The ratio of these two (b/se) is the
test statistic t. If t is greater than 1.96, the critical
value for one comparison at the .05 alpha level,
the hypothesis that there is a linear relationship
between student’s age and being physically attacked
is not rejected.

Statistical Procedures
The comparisons in the text have been tested for
statistical significance to ensure that the differences
are larger than might be expected due to sampling
variation. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited
in the report are statistically significant at the .05
level. Several test procedures were used, depending
upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature
of the statement being tested. The primary test
procedure used in this report was Student’s t statistic,
which tests the difference between two sample
estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for
multiple comparisons. The formula used to compute
the t statistic is as follows:

t=

E1 - E2
√se  12

+

	

se  22

(1)

where E1 and E2 are the estimates to be compared
and se1 and se2 are their corresponding standard
errors. Note that this formula is valid only for
independent estimates. When the estimates are not
independent (for example, when comparing a total
percentage with that for a subgroup included in the
total), a covariance term (i.e., 2 * r * se1 * se2) must
be subtracted from the denominator of the formula:

t=

E1 - E2
√se  12

+

se  22 -

	

(2 * r * se1 * se2 )

(2)

where r is the correlation coefficient. Once the t value
was computed, it was compared to the published

Some comparisons among categories of an ordered
variable with three or more levels involved a test for a
linear trend across all categories, rather than a series
of tests between pairs of categories. In this report,
when differences among percentages were examined
relative to a variable with ordered categories, analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear
relationship between the two variables. To do this,
ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts
corresponding to successive levels of the independent
variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors
(that is, standard errors that were calculated by the
Taylor series method), the variance between the
means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used
to partition the total sum of squares into within- and
between-group sums of squares. These were used to
create mean squares for the within- and betweengroup variance components and their corresponding
F statistics, which were then compared to published
values of F for a significance level of .05. Significant
values of both the overall F and the F associated with
the linear contrast term were required as evidence of
a linear relationship between the two variables.

Glossary of
Terms

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2010

169

General Terms
Crime Any violation of a statute or regulation or any
act that the government has determined is injurious
to the public, including felonies and misdemeanors.
Such violation may or may not involve violence, and
it may affect individuals or property.
Incident A specific criminal act or offense involving
one or more victims and one or more offenders.
Multistage sampling A survey sampling technique in
which there is more than one wave of sampling. That
is, one sample of units is drawn, and then another
sample is drawn within that sample. For example,
at the first stage, a number of Census blocks may be
sampled out of all the Census blocks in the United
States. At the second stage, households are sampled
within the previously sampled Census blocks.
Prevalence The percentage of the population directly
affected by crime in a given period. This rate is based
upon specific information elicited directly from the
respondent regarding crimes committed against his
or her person, against his or her property, or against
an individual bearing a unique relationship to him
or her. It is not based upon perceptions and beliefs
about, or reactions to, criminal acts.
School An education institution consisting of one or
more of grades K through 12.
School crime Any criminal activity that is committed
on school property.
School year The 12-month period of time denoting
the beginning and ending dates for school accounting purposes, usually from July 1 through June 30.
Stratification A survey sampling technique in
which the target population is divided into mutually
exclusive groups or strata based on some variable or
variables (e.g., metropolitan area) and sampling of
units occurs separately within each stratum.

Suicide An act of taking one’s own life voluntarily
and intentionally.
National Crime Victimization Survey
Aggravated assault Attack or attempted attack with
a weapon, regardless of whether or not an injury
occurs, and attack without a weapon when serious
injury results.
At school (students) Inside the school building, on
school property (school parking area, play area, school
bus, etc.), or on the way to or from school.
Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) Geographic
entities defined by the U.S. Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for use by federal statistical
agencies in collecting, tabulating, and publishing
federal statistics.
Rape Forced sexual intercourse including both
psychological coercion as well as physical force.
Forced sexual intercourse means vaginal, anal, or
oral penetration by the offender(s). Includes attempts
and verbal threats of rape. This category also includes
incidents where the penetration is from a foreign
object, such as a bottle.
Robbery Completed or attempted theft, directly
from a person, of property or cash by force or threat
of force, with or without a weapon, and with or
without injury.
Serious violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery,
or aggravated assault.

Unequal probabilities A survey sampling technique
in which sampled units do not have the same probability of selection into the sample. For example, the
investigator may oversample rural students in order
to increase the sample sizes of rural students. Rural
students would then be more likely than other students to be sampled.

Sexual assault A wide range of victimizations,
separate from rape or attempted rape. These crimes
include attacks or attempted attacks generally involving unwanted sexual contact between the victim and
offender. Sexual assault may or may not involve force
and includes such things as grabbing or fondling.
Sexual assault also includes verbal threats.

Specific Terms Used in Various Surveys

Simple assault Attack without a weapon resulting
either in no injury, minor injury, or an undetermined
injury requiring less than 2 days of hospitalization.
Also includes attempted assault without a weapon.

School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study
Homicide An act involving a killing of one person by
another resulting from interpersonal violence.

170

School-associated violent death A homicide or
suicide in which the fatal injury occurred on the
campus of a functioning elementary or secondary
school in the United States, while the victim was on
the way to or from regular sessions at such a school, or
while the victim was attending or traveling to or from
an official school-sponsored event. Victims included
nonstudents as well as students and staff members.

Appendix B: Glossary of Terms

Theft Completed or attempted theft of property or
cash without personal contact.

Victimization A crime as it affects one individual
person or household. For personal crimes, the number
of victimizations is equal to the number of victims involved. The number of victimizations may be greater
than the number of incidents because more than one
person may be victimized during an incident.
Victimization rate A measure of the occurrence of
victimizations among a specific population group.
Violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, or simple assault.
School Crime Supplement
At school In the school building, on school property,
on a school bus, or going to or from school.
Gang Street gangs, fighting gangs, crews, or something else. Gangs may use common names, signs,
symbols, or colors. All gangs, whether or not they
are involved in violent or illegal activity, are included.
Serious violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery,
or aggravated assault.
Total victimization Combination of violent victimization and theft. If a student reported an incident of
either type, he or she is counted as having experienced
any victimization. If the student reported having
experienced both, he or she is counted once under
“total victimization.”
Violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, or simple assault.
Youth Risk Behavior Survey
Illegal drugs Examples of illegal drugs were marijuana, cocaine, inhalants, steroids, or prescription
drugs without a doctor’s permission, heroin, and

more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely
settled surrounding areas) and inside a principal city
(defined as a city that contains the primary population and economic center of a metropolitan statistical
area, which, in turn, is defined as one or more contiguous counties that have a “core” area with a large
population nucleus and adjacent communities that
are highly integrated economically or socially with
the core).
Elementary school A school in which the lowest
grade is less than or equal to grade 6 and the highest
grade is less than or equal to grade 8.
Elementary school teachers An elementary school
teacher is one who, when asked for the grades taught,
checked: (1) only “ungraded” and was designated as
an elementary teacher on the list of teachers provided
by the school; (2) 6th grade or lower or “ungraded,”
and no grade higher than 6th; (3) 6th grade or lower
and 7th grade or higher, and reported a primary
assignment of prekindergarten, kindergarten, or
general elementary; (4) 7th and 8th grades only, and
reported a primary assignment of prekindergarten,
kindergarten, or general elementary; (5) 6th grade or
lower and 7th grade or higher, and reported a primary
assignment of special education and was designated as
an elementary teacher on the list of teachers provided
by the school; or (6) 7th and 8th grades only, and
reported a primary assignment of special education
and was designated as an elementary teacher on the
list of teachers provided by the school. A teacher
at a school that has grade 6 or lower or one that is
“ungraded” with no grade higher than the 8th.
Instructional level Instructional levels divide
teachers into elementary or secondary based on a
combination of the grades taught, main teaching
assignment, and the structure of the teacher’s class(es).
Those with only ungraded classes are categorized as
elementary level teachers if their main assignment
is early childhood/prekindergarten or elementary,
or they teach either special education in a selfcontained classroom or an elementary enrichment
class. All other teachers with ungraded classes are
classified as secondary level. Among teachers with
regularly graded classes, in general, elementary level
teachers teach any of grades prekindergarten through
5th; report an early childhood/prekindergarten,
elementary, self-contained special education, or
elementary enrichment main assignment; or are
those whose preponderance of grades taught are
kindergarten through 6th. In general, secondary-

but usually no grade lower than 5th. They also teach
more of grades 7 through 12 than lower level grades.
Rural A territory outside any urbanized area (defined
as densely settled “cores” with populations of 50,000
or more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent
densely settled surrounding areas) or urban cluster

and was designated as a secondary teacher on the list
of teachers provided by the school; or (6) 6th grade
or lower and 7th grade or higher, or 7th and 8th
grades only, and was not categorized above as either
elementary or secondary.
Suburban A territory outside a principal city (defined
as a city that contains the primary population and
economic center of a metropolitan statistical area,
which, in turn, is defined as one or more contiguous
counties that have a “core” area with a large population nucleus and adjacent communities that are

component, that are widely seen as threatening the
basic values and cultural norms of society at large.
Firearm/explosive device Any weapon that is
designed to (or may readily be converted to) expel a
projectile by the action of an explosive. This includes
guns, bombs, grenades, mines, rockets, missiles, pipe
bombs, or similar devices designed to explode and
capable of causing bodily harm or property damage.

person, property, or society that is motivated, in whole
or in part, by the offender’s bias against a race, color,
national origin, ethnicity, gender, religion, disability,
or sexual orientation.
Insubordination A deliberate and inexcusable defiance of or refusal to obey a school rule, authority, or
a reasonable order. It includes but is not limited to
direct defiance of school authority, failure to attend
assigned detention or on-campus supervision, failure to respond to a call slip, and physical or verbal

Robbery The taking or attempting to take anything
of value that is owned by another person or
organization, under confrontational circumstances
by force or threat of force or violence and/or by

than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000)
and small suburbs (population less than 100,000).
Theft/larceny Taking things valued at over $10
without personal confrontation. Specifically, the
unlawful taking of another person’s property without
personal confrontation, threat, violence, or bodily
harm. Included are pick pocketing, stealing purse or
