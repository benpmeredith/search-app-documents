Executive Summary
Introduction
Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for
teaching and learning, free of crime and violence. Any
instance of crime or violence at school not only affects
the individuals involved, but also may disrupt the
educational process and affect bystanders, the school
itself, and the surrounding community (Brookmeyer,
Fanti, and Henrich 2006; Goldstein, Young, and Boyd
2008).
Establishing reliable indicators of the current state of
school crime and safety across the nation and regularly
updating and monitoring these indicators are important
in ensuring the safety of our nation’s students. This is
the aim of Indicators of School Crime and Safety.
This report is the seventeenth in a series of annual
publications produced jointly by the National Center
for Education Statistics (NCES), Institute of Education
Sciences (IES), in the U.S. Department of Education,
and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) in the U.S.
Department of Justice. This report presents the most
recent data available on school crime and student safety.
The indicators in this report are based on information
drawn from a variety of data sources, including
national surveys of students, teachers, principals, and
postsecondary institutions. Sources include results
from the School-Associated Violent Deaths Study,
sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, the
Department of Justice, and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC); the National Crime
Victimization Survey and School Crime Supplement to
that survey, sponsored by BJS and NCES, respectively;
the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, sponsored by the CDC;
the Schools and Staffing Survey and School Survey
on Crime and Safety, both sponsored by NCES; the
Supplementary Homicide Reports, sponsored by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation; EDFacts, sponsored by
NCES; and the Campus Safety and Security Survey,
sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education. The
most recent data collection for each indicator varied
by survey, from 2009 to 2013. Each data source has an
independent sample design, data collection method,
and questionnaire design, or is the result of a universe
data collection. All comparisons described in this report
are statistically significant at the .05 level. Additional
information about methodology and the datasets
analyzed in this report may be found in appendix A.
This report covers topics such as victimization, teacher
injury, bullying and cyber-bullying, school conditions,
fights, weapons, availability and student use of drugs
and alcohol, student perceptions of personal safety
at school, and criminal incidents at postsecondary
institutions. Indicators of crime and safety are
compared across different population subgroups and
over time. Data on crimes that occur away from school
are offered as a point of comparison where available.

Key Findings
Preliminary data show that there were 45 schoolassociated violent deaths1 from July 1, 2011, through
June 30, 2012. (Indicator 1). In 2013, among
students ages 12–18, there were about 1,420,900
nonfatal victimizations at school,2 which included
454,900 theft victimizations3 and 966,000 violent
victimizations4 (simple assault and serious violent
victimizations5). (Indicator 2). Out of 791 total hate
crimes6 reported on college campuses in 2012, the most
common type of hate crime reported by institutions was
destruction, damage, and vandalism (412  incidents),
followed by intimidation (261  incidents), simple
assault (79 incidents), aggravated assault (14 incidents),
larceny (11 incidents), robbery (5 incidents), burglary
(5  incidents), and forcible sex offenses (4 incidents;
Indicator 23).
The following key findings are drawn from each
section of the report.
Violent Deaths

x

Of the 45 student, staff, and nonstudent schoolassociated violent deaths occurring between July 1,
2011, and June 30, 2012, there were 26 homicides,
14 suicides, and 5 legal intervention deaths.7 Of
these 45 deaths, there were 15 homicides, 5 suicides,
and 0 legal intervention deaths of school-age youth
(ages 5–18) at school. (Indicator 1).

1

A “school-associated violent death” is defined as “a homicide,
suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement
officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a
functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States,
while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at
school or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from
an official school-sponsored event.” Victims of school-associated
violent deaths include students, staff members, and others who
are not students or staff members.
2
“At school” includes inside the school building, on school
property, or on the way to or from school.
3
“Theft” includes attempted and completed purse-snatching,
completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed
thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not
include robbery, which involves the threat or use of force and is
classified as a violent crime.
4
“Violent victimization” includes serious violent crimes and
simple assault.
5
“Serious violent victimization” includes the crimes of rape,
sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.
6
A hate crime is a criminal offense that is motivated, in whole
or in part, by the perpetrator’s bias against the victim(s) based
on their race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or
disability.
7
A legal intervention death is defined as a death caused by
police and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force,
excluding legal executions.

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2014

x

During the 2011–12 school year, 15 of the 1,199
homicides among school-age youth ages 5–18
occurred at school.8 During the 2011 calendar
year, 5 of the 1,568 suicides of school-age youth
ages 5–18 occurred at school. (Indicator 1).

x

In 2013, approximately 3 percent of students
ages 12–18 reported being victimized at school
during the previous 6 months. Two percent
of students reported theft, 1 percent reported
violent victimization, and less than one-half of
1 percent reported serious violent victimization.
(Indicator 3).

x

Between 1995 and 2013, the percentage of students
ages 12–18 who reported being victimized at
school during the previous 6 months decreased
overall (from 10 to 3 percent), as did the
percentages of students who reported theft (from
7 to 2 percent), violent victimization (from 3
to 1 percent), and serious violent victimization
(from 1 percent to less than one-half of 1 percent;
Indicator 3).

x

About 7 percent of students in grades 9–12
reported being threatened or injured with a
weapon such as a gun, knife, or club on school
property13 in 2013. The percentage of students
who reported being threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property has decreased over the
last decade, from 9 percent in 2003 to 7 percent
in 2013. (Indicator 4).

x

In each survey year from 1993 to 2013, a higher
percentage of males than of females in grades
9–12 reported being threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property. In 2013,
approximately 8 percent of males and 6 percent of
females reported being threatened or injured with
a weapon on school property. The percentage of
males who reported being threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property was lower in
2013 than in 2011 (8 vs. 10 percent); however,
the percentages for females were not measurably
different between these two years. (Indicator 4).

x

In 2013, a higher percentage of students in grades
9–12 reported being threatened or injured with
a weapon on school property 1 time (3 percent)
than reported being threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property 2 or 3 times
(2  percent), 4 to 11 times (1 percent), or 12 or
more times (1 percent; Indicator 4).

x

During the 2011–12 school year, a higher
percentage of public than private school
teachers reported being threatened with injury
(10 vs. 3 percent) or being physically attacked
(6 vs. 3 percent) by a student from their school.
(Indicator 5).

Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization

x

In 2013, among students ages 12–18, there were
about 1,420,900 nonfatal victimizations at school,9
which included 454,900 theft victimizations10 and
966,000 violent victimizations11 (simple assault
and serious violent victimizations12). (Indicator 2).

x

In 2013, students ages 12–18 experienced higher
rates of nonfatal victimizations at school than
away from school. That year, they experienced
55 victimizations per 1,000 students at school
and 30 per 1,000 students away from school.
(Indicator 2).

x

In 2013, the rate of violent victimization at school
(37 per 1,000 students) was greater than the rate
of violent victimization away from school (15 per
1,000 students). This difference was driven
primarily by higher rates of simple assault at school
(33 per 1,000 students) than away from school
that year (9 per 1,000; Indicator 2).

x

In 2013, students experienced about 5 serious
violent victimizations per 1,000 students at school
and 6 victimizations per 1,000 students away from
school. (Indicator 2).

x

In 2013, the total victimization rate at school
was greater for students ages 12–14 (67 per 1,000
students) compared with students ages 15–18 (44
per 1,000 students; Indicator 2).

x

Between 1992 and 2013, the total victimization
rates for students ages 12–18 generally declined
both at and away from school. (Indicator 2).

A lower percentage of 12th-graders than of 9th-,
10th-, or 11th-graders reported that illegal drugs
were made available to them on school property
in 2013; that year, 19 percent of 12th-graders
reported that illegal drugs were made available

During the 2009–10 school year, 85 percent of
public schools recorded that one or more crime
incidents had taken place at school,14 amounting
to an estimated 1.9 million crimes. This translates
to a rate of 40 crimes per 1,000 public school
students enrolled in 2009–10. During the same
year, 60 percent of public schools reported a
crime incident that occurred at school to the
police, amounting to 689,000 crimes—or 15
crimes per 1,000 public school students enrolled.
(Indicator 6 ).
In 2009–10, about 74 percent of public schools
recorded one or more violent incidents of crime,
16 percent recorded one or more serious violent
incidents, 44 percent recorded one or more
thefts, and 68 percent recorded one or more

of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that other
teachers at their school enforced the school
rules, and 84 percent reported that the principal
enforced the school rules. (Indicator 12).

2013. The percentage of students who reported
seeing hate-related graffiti in 2013 was lower than
the percentage in 2011 (28 percent; Indicator 10).

x

In 2013, a lower percentage of White students
than students of any other race/ethnicity reported
being called a hate-related word during the school
year. About 5 percent of White students reported
being called a hate-related word, compared with 7
percent of Hispanic students, 8 percent of Black
students, 10 percent of Asian students, and 11
percent of students of other races/ethnicities.
There were no measurable differences by race/

In 2013, about 22 percent of students ages
12–18 reported being bullied at school during
the school year. Higher percentages of females
than of males reported that they were made fun
of, called names, or insulted (15 vs. 13 percent);

In 2013, approximately 7 percent of students ages
12–18 reported being cyber-bullied anywhere
during the school year. A higher percentage of
female students than of male students reported
being victims of cyber-bullying overall (9 vs. 5

notifying an adult after being bullied at school
than after being cyber-bullied anywhere (39 vs.
23 percent; Indicator 11).
The percentage of students who reported being
bullied was lower in 2013 (22 percent) than in
every prior survey year (28 percent each in 2005,

more times during the previous 12 months. About
7 percent of students in these grades reported
being in a physical fight on school property 1 to
3 times, 1 percent reported being in a physical
fight on school property 4 to 11 times, and less
than 1 percent reported being in a physical fight
on school property 12 or more times during the
12-month period. (Indicator 13).
The percentage of students who reported carrying
a weapon on school property in the previous
30 days declined from 12 percent in 1993 to
5 percent in 2013. The percentage of students
carrying weapons anywhere was lower in 2013 (18
percent) than in 1993 (22 percent; Indicator 14).

consuming alcohol on at least 1 day during the
previous 30 days. This percentage was higher
than the percentages for 9th-graders (24 percent),
10th-graders (31 percent), and 11thgraders (39 percent; Indicator 15).

In 2013, about 5 percent of students reported
that they avoided at least one school activity or
class16 or one or more places in school17 during
the previous school year because they feared being
attacked or harmed.18 Specifically, 2 percent of
students reported avoiding at least one school
activity or class, and 4 percent reported avoiding
one or more places in school. (Indicator 18).
A higher percentage of Hispanic students
(5  percent) than of White students (3 percent)
reported avoiding one or more places in school in
2013. In addition, a higher percentage of public
school students (4 percent) than of private school
students (1 percent) reported avoiding one or
more places in school. (Indicator 18).

reported that they used security cameras to
monitor the school. (Indicator 20).

xx

During the 2009–10 school year, 43 percent of
public schools reported the presence of one or
more security staff at their school at least once a
week during the school year. Twenty-nine percent
of schools reported having at least one full-time
employed security staff member who was present
at least once a week, and 14 percent of schools
reported having only part-time staff. Twentyeight percent of all schools reported the presence
of security staff routinely carrying a firearm at
school. (Indicator 20).

xx

In 2013, nearly all students ages 12–18 reported
that they observed the use of at least one of the
selected security measures at their schools. Most
students ages 12–18 reported that their schools
had a written code of student conduct and a
requirement that visitors sign in (96 percent each).
Approximately 90 percent of students reported
the presence of school staff (other than security
guards or assigned police officers) or other adults
supervising the hallway, 77 percent reported
the presence of one or more security cameras
to monitor the school, and 76 percent reported
locked entrance or exit doors during the day.
Eleven percent of students reported the use of
metal detectors at their schools, representing the
least observed of the selected safety and security
measures. (Indicator 21).

xx

About 76 percent of students ages 12–18 reported
observing locked entrance or exit doors during
the day in 2013, representing an increase from
65 percent in 2011 as well as an overall increase
from 38 percent in 1999. (Indicator 21).

Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures

xx

During the 2009–10 school year, 39 percent
of public schools (about 32,300 schools) took
at least one serious disciplinary action against
a student for specific offenses. Of the 433,800
serious disciplinary actions taken during the
2009–10 school year, 74 percent were suspensions
for 5 days or more, 20 percent were transfers to
specialized schools, and 6 percent were removals
with no services for the remainder of the school
year. (Indicator 19).

xx

Between the 2003–04 and 2011–12 school
yea rs, t he percenta ge of public schools
reporting that they required that students wear
uniforms increased from 13 to 19 percent. Also,
the percentages of public schools reporting
the following security measures were higher
in 2011–12 than in 2003–04: using security
cameras to monitor the school; controlling
access to buildings during school hours;
and controlling access to grounds during school
hours. (Indicator 20).

xx

During the 2011–12 school year, 88 percent of
public schools reported that they controlled access
to school buildings by locking or monitoring
doors during school hours, and 64 percent

16 
“Avoided school activities or classes” includes student reports
of three activities: avoiding any (extracurricular) activities,
avoiding any classes, or staying home from school. Before 2007,
students were asked whether they avoided “any extracurricular
activities.” Starting in 2007, the survey wording was changed
to “any activities.” Caution should be used when comparing
changes in this item over time.
17 
“Avoiding one or more places in school” includes student
reports of five activities: avoiding the entrance, any hallways or
stairs, parts of the cafeteria, restrooms, and other places inside
the school building.
18 
For the 2001 survey only, the wording was changed
from “attack or harm” to “attack or threaten to attack.” See
appendix A for more information.

xx

In 2012, there were 29,500 criminal incidents at
public and private 2-year and 4-year postsecondary
institutions that were reported to police and
security agencies, representing a 4 percent

2001 to 35.6 per 10,000 students in 2012. Also,
the number of referrals for liquor law violations
per 10,000 students was higher in 2012 (127.4)
than in 2001 (111.3). In contrast, the number of
referrals per 10,000 students for illegal weapons

drug law violations increased by 76 percent during
this period, reaching 20,800, and arrests for liquor
law violations rose by 8 percent, reaching 29,500.
(Indicator 22).

campuses in 2012, the most common type of hate
crime reported by institutions was destruction,

xx

Race-related hate crimes accounted for 46 percent
of reported vandalisms classified as hate crimes, 45
percent of reported intimidations, and 44 percent
of reported simple assaults in 2012. Additionally,
one-quarter of vandalism and intimidation hate
crimes and 28 percent of simple assaults were

Foreword
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2014 provides
the most recent national indicators on school crime
and safety. The information presented in this report
is intended to serve as a reference for policymakers
and practitioners so that they can develop effective
programs and policies aimed at violence and school
crime prevention. Accurate information about the
nature, extent, and scope of the problem being
addressed is essential for developing effective
programs and policies.
This is the seventeenth edition of Indicators of School
Crime and Safety, a joint publication of the Bureau
of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES). This report provides
detailed statistics to inform the nation about current
aspects of crime and safety in schools.
The 2014 edition of Indicators of School Crime
and Safety includes the most recent available data,
compiled from a number of statistical data sources
supported by the federal government. Such sources
include results from the School-Associated Violent
Deaths Study, sponsored by the U.S. Department
of Education, the Department of Justice, and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC); the National Crime Victimization Survey and
School Crime Supplement to the survey, sponsored

by the BJS and NCES, respectively; the Youth Risk
Behavior Survey, sponsored by the CDC; the Schools
and Staffing Survey and School Survey on Crime and
Safety, both sponsored by NCES; the Supplementary
Homicide Reports, sponsored by the Federal Bureau
of Investigation; EDFacts, sponsored by NCES; and
the Campus Safety and Security Survey, sponsored
by the U.S. Department of Education.
The entire report is available on the Internet
(http://nces.ed.gov/programs/crimeindicators/

Introduction

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2014

1

Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for
teaching and learning free of crime and violence.
Any instance of crime or violence at school not only
affects the individuals involved but also may disrupt
the educational process and affect bystanders, the
school itself, and the surrounding community
(Brookmeyer, Fanti, and Henrich 2006; Goldstein,
Young, and Boyd 2008). For both students and
teachers, victimization at school can have lasting
effects. In addition to experiencing loneliness,
depression, and adjustment difficulties (Crick and
Bigbee 1998; Crick and Grotpeter 1996; Nansel et al.
2001; Prinstein, Boergers, and Vernberg 2001; Storch
et al. 2003), victimized children are more prone to
truancy (Ringwalt, Ennett, and Johnson 2003),
poor academic performance (MacMillan and Hagan
2004; Wei and Williams 2004), dropping out of
school (Beauvais et al. 1996; MacMillan and Hagan
2004), and violent behaviors (Nansel et al. 2003).
For teachers, incidents of victimization may lead to
professional disenchantment and even departure from
the profession altogether (Karcher 2002; Smith and
Smith 2006).
For parents, school staff, and policymakers to
effectively address school crime, they need an accurate
understanding of the extent, nature, and context of
the problem. However, it is difficult to gauge the
scope of crime and violence in schools given the large
amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of
extreme school violence. Measuring progress toward
safer schools requires establishing good indicators of
the current state of school crime and safety across
the nation and regularly updating and monitoring
these indicators; this is the aim of Indicators of School
Crime and Safety.

Purpose and Organization of This Report
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2014 is the
seventeenth in a series of reports produced since
1998 by the National Center for Education Statistics
(NCES) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)
that present the most recent data available on school
crime and student safety. Although the data presented
in this report are the most recent data available at the
time of publication, the data do not cover the most
recent two or more school years. The report is not
intended to be an exhaustive compilation of school
crime and safety information, nor does it attempt
to explore reasons for crime and violence in schools.
Rather, it is designed to provide a brief summary
of information from an array of data sources and
to make data on national school crime and safety
accessible to policymakers, educators, parents, and
the general public.

Introduction

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2014 is
organized into sections that delineate specific
concerns to readers, starting with a description of the
most serious violent crimes. The sections cover violent
deaths; nonfatal student and teacher victimization;
school environment; fights, weapons, and illegal
substances; fear and avoidance; discipline, safety, and
security measures, and campus safety and security.
Each section contains a set of indicators that, taken
together, aim to describe a distinct aspect of school
crime and safety. Where available, data on crimes
that occur outside of school grounds are offered
as a point of comparison.1 Supplemental tables for
each indicator provide more detailed breakouts and
standard errors for estimates. A glossary of terms and
a reference section appear at the end of the report.
This edition of the report contains updated data for
sixteen indicators: violent deaths at school and away
from school (Indicator 1), incidence of victimization
at school and away from school (Indicator 2),
prevalence of victimization at school (Indicator
3), threats and injuries with weapons on school
property (Indicator 4), students’ reports of gangs at
school (Indicator 8), students’ reports of illegal drug
availability on school property (Indicator 9), students’
reports of being called hate-related words and seeing
hate-related graffiti (Indicator 10), bullying at school
and cyber-bullying anywhere (Indicator 11), physical
fights on school property and anywhere (Indicator 13),
students carrying weapons on school property and
anywhere and students’ access to firearms (Indicator
14), students’ use of alcohol on school property and
anywhere (Indicator 15), students’ use of marijuana
on school property and anywhere (Indicator 16 ),
students’ perceptions of personal safety at school and
away from school (Indicator  17), students’ reports of
avoiding school activities or classes or specific places
in school (Indicator 18), students’ reports of safety and
security measures observed at school (Indicator 21),
and criminal incidents at postsecondary institutions
(Indicator 22).
In addition, this year’s report introduces a new
indicator on hate crime incidents at postsecondary
institutions (Indicator 23).
Also included in this year’s report are references to
publications relevant to each indicator that the reader
may want to consult for additional information
or analyses. These references can be found in the
“For more information” sidebars at the bottom of
each indicator.

Data in this report are not adjusted to reflect the number of
hours that youths spend on school property versus the number
of hours they spend elsewhere.

Data
The indicators in this report are based on information
drawn from a variety of independent data sources,
including national surveys of students, teachers,
principals, and postsecondary institutions and
universe data collections from federal departments
and agencies, including BJS, NCES, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, and the Off ice of
Postsecondary Education. Each data source has an
independent sample design, data collection method,
and questionnaire design, or is the result of a universe
data collection.
The combination of multiple, independent sources
of data provides a broad perspective on school crime
and safety that could not be achieved through any
single source of information. However, readers should
be cautious when comparing data from different
sources. While every effort has been made to keep key
definitions consistent across indicators, differences in
sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and
question phrasing can all affect the comparability
of results. For example, both Indicators 20 and 21
report data on selected security and safety measures
used in schools. Indicator 20 uses data collected from
a schools and staffing survey administered to public
and private school principals about safety and security
practices used in their schools for the 2011–12
school year, as well as from a survey of public school
principals about safety and security practices used in
their schools during the 2009–10 school year. The
schools range from primary through high schools.
Indicator 21, however, uses data collected from 12through 18-year-old students residing in a sample of
households. These students were asked whether they
observed selected safety and security measures in
their school in 2013, but they may not have known
whether, in fact, the security measure was present.
In addition, different indicators contain various
approaches to the analysis of school crime data and,
therefore, will show different perspectives on school
crime. For example, both Indicators 2 and 3 report
data on theft and violent victimization at school based
on the National Crime Victimization Survey and the
School Crime Supplement to that survey, respectively.
While Indicator 2 examines the number of incidents
of victimization, Indicator 3 examines the percentage
or prevalence of students who reported victimization.
Table A provides a summary of some of the variations
in the design and coverage of sample surveys used in
this report.
Several indicators in this report are based on selfreported survey data. Readers should note that
limitations inherent to self-reported data may affect

estimates (Addington 2005; Cantor and Lynch 2000).
First, unless an interview is “bounded” or a reference
period is established, estimates may include events
that exceed the scope of the specified reference period.
This factor may artificially increase reported incidents
because respondents may recall events outside of the
given reference period. Second, many of the surveys
rely on the respondent to “self-determine” a condition.
This factor allows the respondent to define a situation
based upon his or her own interpretation of whether
the incident was a crime or not. On the other hand,
the same situation may not necessarily be interpreted
in the same way by a bystander or the perceived
offender. Third, victim surveys tend to emphasize
crime events as incidents that take place at one point
in time. However, victims can often experience a
state of victimization in which they are threatened or
victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally, respondents
may recall an event inaccurately. For instance, people
may forget the event entirely or recall the specifics
of the episode incorrectly. These and other factors
may affect the precision of the estimates based on
these surveys.
Data trends are discussed in this report when possible.
Where trends are not discussed, either the data
are not available in earlier surveys or the wording
of the survey question changed from year to year,
eliminating the ability to discuss any trend.
Where data from samples are reported, as is the
case with most of the indicators in this report, the
standard error is calculated for each estimate provided
in order to determine the “margin of error” for these
estimates. The standard errors of the estimates for
different subpopulations in an indicator can vary
considerably and should be taken into account when
making comparisons. With the exception of Indicator
2, in this report, in cases where the standard error
was between 30 and 50 percent of the associated
estimate, the estimates were noted with a “!” symbol
(Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of
variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and
50 percent). In Indicator 2, the “!” symbol cautions
the reader that estimates marked indicate that the
reported statistic was based on 10 or fewer cases.
With the exception of Indicator 2, in cases where
the standard error was 50 percent or greater of the
associated estimate, the estimate was suppressed
(Reporting standards not met. Either there are too
few cases for a reliable estimate or the coefficient
of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater). See
appendix A for more information.
The appearance of a “!” symbol (Interpret data with
caution) in a table or figure indicates a data cell with

a high ratio of standard error to estimate so the reader
should use caution when interpreting such data.
These estimates are still discussed, however, when
statistically significant differences are found despite
large standard errors.
The comparisons in the text have been tested for
statistical significance to ensure that the differences
are larger than might be expected due to sampling
variation. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons
cited in the report are statistically significant at
the .05  level. Several test procedures were used,
depending upon the type of data being analyzed
and the nature of the comparison being tested.
The primary test procedure used in this report was
Student’s t statistic, which tests the difference between
two sample estimates. The t test formula was not
adjusted for multiple comparisons. Linear trend tests
were used to examine changes in percentages over
a range of values such as time or age. Linear trends
tests allow one to examine whether, for example, the
percentage of students who reported using drugs
Table A.	

increased (or decreased) over time or whether the
percentage of students who reported being physically
attacked in school increased (or decreased) with age.
When differences among percentages were examined
relative to a variable with ordinal categories (such as
grade), analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test
for a linear relationship between the two variables.
Percentages reported in the tables and figures
are generally rounded to one decimal place
(e.g., 76.5 percent), while percentages reported in the
text are generally rounded from the original number
to whole numbers (with any value of 0.50 or above
rounded to the next highest whole number). While
the data labels on the figures have been rounded to
one decimal place, the graphical presentation of these
data is based on the unrounded estimates.
Appendix A of this report contains descriptions of all
the datasets used in this report and a discussion of
how standard errors were calculated for each estimate.

Indicator 1
Violent Deaths at School and Away From School
Over all available survey years, the percentage of youth homicides occurring at school remained at less than
2 percent of the total number of youth homicides, and the percentage of youth suicides occurring at school
remained at less than 1 percent of the total number of youth suicides.
Violent deaths at schools are rare but tragic events
with far-reaching effects on the school population
and surrounding community. Indicator 1 presents
data on school-associated violent deaths that were
collected through the School-Associated Violent
Deaths (SAVD) Surveillance Study. The most recent
data released for the SAVD Surveillance Study cover
the period from July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012.
More recent information gathered from media reports
can provide a glimpse of SAVD cases occurring since
June 2012. For example, the Sandy Hook Elementary
School shooting incident on December 14, 2012,
in Newtown, Connecticut resulted in 20 child
homicides, 6 adult homicides, and 1 adult suicide.2
The SAVD Surveillance Study defines a schoolassociated violent death as “a homicide, suicide, or
legal intervention 3 (involving a law enforcement
officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on the
campus of a functioning elementary or secondary
school in the United States.” School-associated violent
deaths include those that occurred while the victim
was on the way to or returning from regular sessions at
school or while the victim was attending or traveling
to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims
of school-associated violent deaths include not only
students and staff members, but also others who are
not students or staff members, such as parents.
Between July 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012, there were
a total of 45  school-associated violent deaths in
elementary and secondary schools in the United States
(figure 1.1 and table 1.1). Of the 45 student, staff, and
nonstudent school-associated violent deaths occurring
during this time span, there were 26 homicides,
14 suicides, and 5 legal interventions. Data for school-

associated violent deaths for the 2011–12 school year
are preliminary until interviews with law enforcement
personnel have been completed.
Data on violent deaths occurring away from school
were included in order to compare them to data on
violent deaths occurring at school. The most recent
data available for total suicides of school-age youth
(ages 5–18; referred to as youth in the remainder of
the indicator) are for the 2011 calendar year; the most
recent data available for total homicides of youth are
for the 2011–12 school year.4 During the 2011–12
school year, there were 1,199 homicides of youth
(figure 1.2 and table 1.1). During the 2011 calendar
year, there were 1,568 suicides of youth. During the
2011–12 school year, there were 15 homicides and
5 suicides of school-age youth at school (figure 1.1 and
table 1.1). When instances of homicide and suicide
of school-age youth at school were combined, there
was approximately 1 homicide or suicide for each
2.7 million students enrolled.5
The percentage of youth homicides occurring at school
remained at less than 2 percent of the total number of
youth homicides over all available survey years, even
though the absolute number of homicides of schoolage youth at school varied to some degree across the
years (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). Between 1992–93 and
2011–12, from 1 to 10 school-age youth committed
suicide at school each year, with no consistent pattern
of increase or decrease in the number of suicides.
The percentage of youth suicides occurring at school
remained at less than 1 percent of the total number of
youth suicides over all available survey years.

A legal intervention death is defined as a death caused by
police and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force,
excluding legal executions.

Data on total suicides are available only by calendar year,
whereas data on suicides and homicides at school and data
on total homicides are available by school year. Due to these
differences in reference periods, please use caution when
comparing violent deaths at school to total violent deaths.

The total number of students enrolled in prekindergarten
through 12th grade during the 2011–12 school year
was 54,789,757 (Snyder and Dillow 2015).

This indicator has been updated to include 2011–12 data for total homicides and total legal intervention deaths, and 2011 data
for total suicides. For more information: Table 1.1, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2008), (http://www.cdc.gov/

A school-associated violent death is defined as “a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal
injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States,” while the victim was on the way to or from
regular sessions at school, or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims include students, staff
members, and others who are not students, from July 1, 1992 through June 30, 2012.
NOTE: “At school” includes on school property, on the way to or from regular sessions at school, and while attending or traveling to or from a schoolsponsored event. Estimates were revised and may differ from previously published data.
SOURCE: Data on homicides and suicides of youth ages 5–18 at school and total school-associated violent deaths are from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), 1992–2012 School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study (SAVD), partially funded by the U.S. Department of
Education, Office of Safe and Healthy Students, previously unpublished tabulation (February 2015).

Indicator 2
Incidence of Victimization at School and Away From School6
For students ages 12–18, the rate of violent victimization in 2013 was higher at school than away from
school. The 2013 violent victimization rates were 37 per 1,000 students at school and 15 per 1,000 students
away from school. This difference was driven primarily by higher rates of simple assault at school.
In 62013, data from the National Crime Victimization
Survey showed that students ages 12–18 experienced
more victimizations at school than away from
school.7 Students ages 12–18 experienced about
1,420,900 nonfatal victimizations (theft 8 and
violent victimization9) at school, compared with
about 778,500 nonfatal victimizations away from
school (table 2.1). These figures represent total crime
victimization rates of 55  victimizations per 1,000
students at school and 30 per 1,000 students away
from school.
For most of the years between 1992 and 2008 and
in 2012, the rate of theft at school was higher than
the rate of theft away from school among students
ages 12–18 (figure 2.1). There were no measurable
differences between the rates of theft at school and
away from school in 2009, 2010, 2011, or 2013.
At school, the rate of theft was lower in 2013 (18 thefts
per 1,000 students) than in 2012 (24 thefts per 1,000
students). The rate of theft away from school was not
measurably different between 2012 and 2013. In
2013, the rate of theft away from school was 16 per
1,000 students.
Between 1992 and 2000, the rate of violent
victimization per 1,000 students at school was
either lower than the rate away from school or not
measurably different than the rate away from school.
Since 2001, the rate of violent victimization per 1,000

Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on similar
topics, the survey sources for these two indicators differ with
respect to time coverage and administration. Indicator 3 is
based on data from the School Crime Supplement (SCS) to
the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). For more
information on these two surveys, please see appendix A.

“Students” refers to youth ages 12–18 whose educational
attainment did not exceed grade 12 at the time of the survey.
An uncertain percentage of these persons may not have attended
school during the survey reference period. These data do not take
into account the number of hours that students spend at school
or away from school. “At school” includes inside the school
building, on school property, or on the way to or from school.
8 
“Theft” includes attempted and completed purse-snatching,
completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed
thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not
include robbery, which involves the threat or use of force and is
classified as a violent crime.
9 
“Violent victimization” includes serious violent crimes and
simple assault.

students at school has generally been higher than the
rate away from school or not measurably different than
the rate away from school. In 2013, the rate of violent
victimization at school (37 per 1,000 students) was
greater than the rate of violent victimization away from
school (15 per 1,000 students). This difference was
driven primarily by higher rates of simple assault10 at
school (33 per 1,000 students) than away from school
that year (9 per 1,000).
The rate of serious violent victimization11 against
students ages 12–18 was generally lower at school
than away from school in most survey years between
1992 and 2008. There were no measurable differences
in the rates at school and away from school between
2009 and 2013.
At school, there was no measurable difference between
the rates of serious violent victimization for students
ages 12–18 in 2012 and in 2013. There was also no
measurable difference between 2012 and 2013 in
the rates of serious violent victimizations away from
school for students ages 12–18. In 2013, students
experienced about 5 serious violent victimizations
per 1,000 students at school and 6 victimizations per
1,000 students away from school.
Between 1992 and 2013, the total victimization rates
for students ages 12–18 generally declined both at and
away from school (figure 2.1). The total victimization
rate against students ages 12–18 at school declined
70 percent from 181 victimizations per 1,000 students
in 1992 to 55 victimizations per 1,000 students in
2013. Away from school, the rate of total victimization
declined 83 percent from 173 victimizations per 1,000
students to 30 victimizations per 1,000.
Indicator 2 continued on page 11.

10 

“Simple assault” is the difference between total violence
and serious violence. It includes threats and attacks without a
weapon or serious injury.
11 
“Serious violent victimization” includes the crimes of rape,
sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.

This indicator has been updated to include 2013 data. For more information: Tables 2.1 and 2.2.

This pattern also held for thefts, violent victimizations,
and serious violent victimizations between 1992 and
2013. Thefts at school declined from a rate of 114
per 1,000 students to 18 per 1,000, and the rate of
theft away from school decreased from 79 thefts per
1,000 students to 16 per 1,000. The rate of violent
victimization at school declined overall from 68
victimizations per 1,000 students in 1992 to 37 per
1,000 in 2013; however, this rate increased between

2010 and 2013 (from 17 to 37 per 1,000 students).
Away from school, the rate of violent victimization
declined from 94 victimizations per 1,000 students in
1992 to 15 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2013.
Serious violent victimizations at school declined from
8 per 1,000 students in 1992 to 5 per 1,000 in 2013.
The rate of serious violent victimization away from
school declined from 43 victimizations per 1,000
students in 1992 to 6 per 1,000 in 2013.

Serious violent victimization is also included in all violent victimization.
NOTE: Due to methodological changes, use caution when comparing 2006 estimates to other years. “Serious violent victimization” includes the crimes of
rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. “All violent victimization” includes serious violent crimes as well as simple assault. “Theft” includes
attempted and completed purse-snatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts.
Theft does not include robbery, which involves the threat or use of force and is classified as a violent crime. “Total victimization” includes thefts and
violent crimes. “At school” includes inside the school building, on school property, or on the way to or from school. Although Indicators 2 and 3 present
information on similar topics, the survey sources for these two indicators differ with respect to time coverage and administration. Indicator 3 is based
on data from the School Crime Supplement. For more information on these two surveys, please see appendix A. The population size for students ages
12–18 was 25,856,300 in 2013. Detail may not sum to totals due to rounding. Estimates may vary from previously published reports.

The victimization rates for students in 2013 varied
according to student characteristics. The total
victimization rate at school was greater for students
ages 12–14 (67 per 1,000 students) than for students
ages 15–18 (44 per 1,000 students; table 2.2 and
figure 2.2). This difference was due primarily to
the higher rate of violent victimization at school for
younger students (52 per 1,000 students ages 12–14)
compared with older students (24 per 1,000 students
ages 15–18). No measurable differences were detected
between age groups in the rates of theft victimization
at school or in the rates of total victimization, theft,
and violent victimization away from school in 2013.
In 2013, there were no measurable differences between
the rates of total victimization, theft, and violence at
school for males and females. There were also no
measurable differences between the rates of total
victimization, theft, and violence away from school
for males and females in 2013. In 2013, the rate of
nonfatal victimization for males was 62 victimizations
per 1,000 students at school and the nonfatal
victimization rate for females was 47 victimizations
per 1,000 students at school (figure 2.3). Away from
school, the nonfatal victimization rate for males was

29 victimizations per 1,000 students, and the nonfatal
victimization rate for females was 31 victimizations
per 1,000 students. The rate of violent victimization
for males at school was 43 victimizations per 1,000
students, and the violent victimization rate for females
at school was 31 victimizations per 1,000 students.
Away from school, the violent victimization rate
for males was 13 victimizations per 1,000 students,
and the violent victimization rate for females was
16 victimizations per 1,000 students.
Students residing in rural areas had lower rates
of nonfatal victimization at school than students
residing in urban and suburban areas. Nonfatal
victimization rates at school were 32 per 1,000
students in rural areas, compared with 57 per 1,000
students in urban areas and 60 per 1,000 students in
suburban areas. Students residing in rural areas also
had a lower rate of theft victimization away from
school (11 per 1,000 students) compared to students
residing in urban areas (20 per 1,000 students). There
were no measurable differences by urbanicity in the
violent victimization rates at or away from school for
students living in urban, suburban, or rural areas.

Serious violent victimization is also included in all violent victimization.
NOTE: “Serious violent victimization” includes the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. “All violent victimization”
includes serious violent crimes as well as simple assault. “Theft” includes attempted and completed purse-snatching, completed pickpocketing,
and all attempted and completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery, which involves the threat or use
of force and is classified as a violent crime. “Total victimization” includes theft and violent crimes. “At school” includes inside the school building,
on school property, or on the way to or from school. Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on similar topics, the survey sources for
these two indicators differ with respect to time coverage and administration. Indicator 3 is based on data from the School Crime Supplement. For

Indicator 3
Prevalence of Victimization at School
In 2013, approximately 3 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being victimized at school during
the previous 6 months. Two percent of students reported theft, 1 percent reported violent victimization,
and less than one-half of 1 percent reported serious violent victimization. Between 1995 and 2013, the
percentage of students ages 12–18 who reported being victimized at school decreased overall, as did the
percentages of students who reported theft, violent victimization, and serious violent victimization.
The School Crime Supplement12 collects data on
the percentage of students ages 12–18 who reported
criminal victimization at school13 during the previous
6 months. In addition to the total percentage reported
by students, victimization is reported by type, namely
theft,14 violent victimization,15 and serious violent
victimization.16 Results from the most recent data
collection show that in 2013 approximately 3 percent
of students ages 12–18 reported being victimized at
school during the previous 6 months. Two percent
of students reported theft, 1 percent reported violent
victimization, and less than one-half of 1 percent
reported serious violent victimization (figure 3.1 and
table 3.1).
In 2013, a higher percentage of 9th-graders than
of 12th-graders reported being victimized at school
during the previous 6 months (4 vs. 2 percent; figure
3.2 and table 3.1). The percentage of students who
reported theft was higher for 9th- and 10th-graders

(3 percent each) and 11th-graders (2 percent) than for
8th-graders (1 percent). In addition, the percentage
of students who reported violent victimization was
higher for 6th-graders (3 percent) than for 10thand 11th-graders (1 percent each). No measurable
differences were observed by sex or race/ethnicity in
reports of victimization overall or in reports of specific
types of victimization.
Among students ages 12–18 in 2013, the percentage
reporting theft at school during the previous 6 months
was higher for students from urban and suburban
areas (2 percent each) than for students from rural
areas (1 percent). No measurable differences were
observed between public and private schools in
student reports of victimization overall or in reports
of specific types of victimization.

“At school” includes the school building, on school property,
on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from
school.
14
“Theft” includes attempted and completed purse-snatching,
completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed
thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not
include robbery, which involves the threat or use of force and is
classified as a violent crime.

Serious violent victimization is also included in violent victimization.
NOTE: “Total victimization” includes theft and violent victimization. “Theft” includes attempted and completed purse-snatching, completed
pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery, which involves the
threat or use of force and is classified as a violent crime. “Serious violent victimization” includes the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, and
aggravated assault. “Violent victimization” includes the serious violent crimes as well as simple assault. “At school” includes the school building,
on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and
because students who reported both theft and violent victimization are counted only once in total victimization. Although Indicators 2 and 3 present
information on similar topics, the survey sources for these two indicators differ with respect to time coverage and administration. Indicator 3 is based
on data from the School Crime Supplement. For more information on these two surveys, please see appendix A.

Between 1995 and 2013, the percentage of students
ages 12–18 who reported being victimized at school
during the previous 6 months decreased overall (from
10 to 3 percent), as did the percentages of students
who reported theft (from 7 to 2 percent), violent
victimization (from 3 to 1 percent), and serious violent
victimization (from 1 percent to less than one-half of
1 percent). The percentage of students who reported
being victimized at school decreased between 1995
and 2013 for both male (from 10 to 3  percent)
and female students (from 9 to 3 percent), as well
as for White (from 10 to 3 percent), Black (from
10  to 3 percent), and Hispanic students (from 8 to
3 percent). In addition, the percentages of students
who reported being victimized decreased between
1995 and 2013 for all grades 6 through 12.

A decrease between 1995 and 2013 in the percentage
of students reporting criminal victimization also
occurred by school characteristics. About 9 percent
of students from urban areas, 10 percent of students
from suburban areas, and 8 percent of students
from rural areas reported being victimized at school
in 1995, compared with 3 percent each of students
from urban and suburban areas and 2 percent of
students from rural areas in 2013. About 10 percent
of public school students and 7 percent of private
school students reported being victimized at school
in 1995; the reported percent decreased to 3 percent
each for public and private school students in 2013.

Indicator 4
Threats and Injuries With Weapons on School Property
In 2013, about 7 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported that they were threatened or injured with
a weapon on school property. The percentage of students who reported being threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property has decreased over the last decade, from 9 percent in 2003 to 7 percent in 2013.
In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades
9–12 were asked whether they had been threatened or
injured with a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club on
school property17 during the 12 months preceding the
survey. In 2013, about 7 percent of students reported
they were threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property (table 4.1). This percentage was not
measurably different from the percentages reported
in 2011 and in 1993 (the first year of data collection
for this item), but it decreased over the last decade,
from a high of 9 percent in 2003 to 7 percent in 2013.
In each survey year from 1993 to 2013, a higher
percentage of males than of females reported being
threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property in the previous 12 months (figure 4.1 and
table 4.1). In 2013, approximately 8 percent of males
and 6 percent of females reported being threatened
or injured with a weapon on school property. The
percentage of males who reported being threatened or
injured with a weapon on school property was lower
in 2013 than in 2011 (8 vs. 10 percent); however, the
percentages for females were not measurably different
between these two years.
There were differences in the percentages of students
who reported being threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property in the previous 12 months
by race/ethnicity and grade level. In 2013, lower
percentages of White students (6 percent) and Asian
students (5 percent) than of Hispanic students
(8  percent) and American Indian/Alaska Native
students (18 percent) reported being threatened or

17 

injured with a weapon on school property (figure 4.2
and table 4.1). In addition, a lower percentage of
White students than of Black students reported
being threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property (6 vs. 8 percent). In 2013, a lower percentage
of 12th-graders (5 percent) than of students in any
other grade (9 percent of 9th-graders and 7 percent
each of 10th- and 11th-graders) reported being
threatened or injured with a weapon (table 4.1).
As part of the survey students were also asked how
many times they had been threatened or injured with
a weapon on school property during the previous
12 months. In 2013, 93 percent of students reported
that they had not been threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property. A higher percentage of
students reported being threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property 1 time (3 percent) than
reported being threatened or injured with a weapon
on school property 2 or 3 times (2 percent), 4 to 11
times (1  percent), or 12 or more times (1 percent;
figure 4.3 and table 4.1).
In 2013, the percentage of public school students who
reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property during the previous 12 months varied
among the 35 states for which data were available.
Among these states, the percentage of students who
reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property ranged from 4 percent in Wisconsin
and Massachusetts to 11 percent in Louisiana and
Arkansas (table 4.2).

“On school property” was not defined for survey respondents.

This indicator has been updated to include 2013 data. For more information: Tables 4.1 and 4.2, and Centers for Disease

Indicator 5
Teachers Threatened With Injury or Physically Attacked by Students
During the 2011–12 school year, a higher percentage of public than private school teachers reported being
threatened with injury (10 vs. 3 percent) or being physically attacked (6 vs. 3 percent) by a student from
their school.
Students are not the only victims of intimidation or
violence in schools. Teachers are also subject to threats
and physical attacks, and students from their schools
sometimes commit these offenses. The Schools and
Staffing Survey (SASS) asks school teachers whether
they were threatened with injury or physically
attacked by a student from their school in the previous
12 months. During the 2011–12 school year, 9 percent
of school teachers reported being threatened with
injury by a student from their school (table 5.1).
This percentage was lower than the 12 percent of
teachers who reported being threatened with injury in
1993–94, but higher than the percentages of teachers
who reported being threatened with injury in
2003–04 and 2007–08 (7 percent each; figure 5.1).
The percentage of teachers reporting that they had
been physically attacked by a student from their school
in 2011–12 (5 percent) was higher than in any previous
survey year (ranging from 3 to 4 percent).
During the 2011–12 school year, there were no
measurable differences in the percentages of male
and female teachers who reported being threatened
with injury during the school year (9 percent each);
however, there were gender differences in the reports
of being physically attacked (figure 5.2). Six percent
of female school teachers reported being physically
attacked by a student from their school, compared
with 4 percent of male teachers.
There were some differences in the percentages of
teachers who reported being threatened by a student
and being physically attacked by the race/ethnicity
of the teacher. In the 2011–12 school year, a higher

percentage of Black teachers (14 percent) than White
teachers and teachers of other racial/ethnic groups
(9 percent each) reported being threatened by a
student from their school during the school year.
A higher percentage of Black teachers (8 percent)
than Hispanic teachers (4 percent) reported being
physically attacked by a student.
The percentages of teachers who reported being
threatened with injury or being physically attacked
during the school year by a student from their school
varied by school characteristics during the 2011–12
school year (figure 5.3). The percentage of elementary
teachers who reported being physically attacked by a
student was higher than the percentage of secondary
teachers reporting it (8 vs. 3 percent). In addition,
a higher percentage of public than private school
teachers reported being threatened with injury
(10 vs. 3 percent) or being physically attacked (6 vs.
3 percent) by a student during 2011–12.
Public school teachers’ reports of being threatened
with injury or physically attacked varied among
the states and the District of Columbia. During the
2011–12 school year, the percentage of public school
teachers who reported being threatened with injury
during the previous 12 months ranged from 5 percent
in Oregon to 18 percent in Louisiana (table 5.2). The
percentage who reported being physically attacked
ranged from 3 percent in Alabama, Mississippi,
North Dakota, Oregon, and Tennessee to 11 percent
in Wisconsin.

Indicator 6
Violent and Other Crime Incidents at Public Schools, and Those
Reported to the Police
In 2009–10, about 74 percent of public schools recorded one or more violent incidents, 16 percent recorded
one or more serious violent incidents, and 44 percent recorded one or more thefts.
In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public
school principals were asked to provide the number
of violent incidents,18 serious violent incidents,19 thefts
of items valued at $10 or greater without personal
confrontation, and other incidents20 that occurred at
their school.21 Public school principals were also asked
to provide the number of incidents they reported to
the police. This indicator presents the percentage of
public schools that recorded one or more of these
specified crimes, the total number of these crimes
recorded, and the rate of crimes per 1,000 students.
These data are also presented for crimes that were
reported to the police.
In all survey years the percentage of public schools
that recorded incidents of crime was between 85 and
86 percent, with the exception of school year 2003–
04. In 2003–04, the percentage of public schools that
recorded incidents of crime was 89 percent. Similarly,
the percentage of public schools that reported
incidents of crime to the police was between 60 and
62 percent in all survey years with the exception of
2003–04, when 65 percent of public schools reported
one or more incidents to the police.
For the majority of types of crime, the percentages
of public schools recording incidents of crime or
reporting incidents of crime to the police in 2009–10
were not measurably different from the percentages
of schools doing so in 2007–08. However, the
18 
“Violent incidents” include rape, sexual battery other than
rape, physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, threat
of physical attack with or without a weapon, and robbery with
or without a weapon.
19 
“Serious violent incidents” include rape, sexual battery other
than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon, threat of
physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a
weapon.
20 
“Other incidents” include possession of a firearm or explosive
device; possession of a knife or sharp object; distribution,
possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol; vandalism; and
inappropriate distribution, possession, or use of prescription
drugs.
21 
“At school” was defined for respondents to include activities
that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school
buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or
activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that
occurred before, during, or after normal school hours, or when
school activities or events were in session.

percentage of schools that recorded vandalism
decreased from 49 percent in 2007–08 to 46 percent
in 2009–10.
During the 2009–10 school year, 85 percent of public
schools recorded that one or more of these incidents
of violence, theft, or other crimes had taken place,
amounting to an estimated 1.9 million crimes (figure
6.1 and table 6.1). This figure translates to a rate of
approximately 40 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled
in 2009–10. During the same year, 60 percent of
schools reported one of the specified crimes to the
police, amounting to about 689,000 crimes—or
15 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled.
In 2009–10, a greater percentage of schools recorded
an incident of crime than reported an incident of
crime to the police. This pattern held true for violent
crimes, serious violent crimes, thefts, and other
crimes. Seventy-four percent of schools recorded one
or more violent incidents of crime (a rate of 25 crimes
per 1,000 students enrolled), 16 percent recorded one
or more serious violent incidents (a rate of 1 crime
per 1,000 students enrolled), 44 percent recorded one
or more thefts (a rate of 5 crimes per 1,000 students
enrolled), and 68 percent recorded one or more
other incidents (a rate of 9 crimes per 1,000 students
enrolled). In comparison, 40 percent of public schools
reported at least one violent incident to police (a rate
of 6 reported crimes per 1,000 students), 10 percent
reported at least one serious violent incident to
police (a rate of less than 1 percent reported crimes
per 1,000 students), 25 percent reported at least one
theft to police (a rate of 3 reported crimes per 1,000
students), and 46 percent reported one or more other
incidents to police (a rate of 6 reported crimes per
1,000 students).

“Theft or larceny” (taking things worth over $10 without personal confrontation) was defined for respondents as “the unlawful taking of another
person’s property without personal confrontation, threat, violence, or bodily harm.” This includes pocket picking, stealing a purse or backpack (if left
unattended or no force was used to take it from owner), theft from a building, theft from a motor vehicle or motor vehicle parts or accessories, theft
of a bicycle, theft from a vending machine, and all other types of thefts.

The percentage of schools that recorded incidents
of violent crime, serious violent crime, theft, and
other incidents varied by school characteristics. For
example, by school level, primary schools recorded
lower percentages of these types of crimes than
middle schools and high schools: 64 percent of
primary schools recorded violent incidents of crime
compared with 91 percent each of middle schools
and high schools (figure 6.2 and table 6.2). A lower
percentage of primary schools recorded serious violent
incidents of crime (13 percent) than middle or high
schools (19 and 28 percent, respectively), a lower
percentage of primary schools recorded incidents of
theft (26 percent) than middle or high schools (65 and
83 percent, respectively), and a lower percentage of
primary schools recorded other incidents (57 percent)
than middle or high schools (82 and 92 percent,
respectively).
A similar pattern was observed for public schools
that reported such incidents of violent crime, serious
violent crime, theft, and other incidents to the police.
The percentages of primary schools that reported
incidents of these types of crime to the police were
lower than for middle schools and high schools (figure
6.2 and table 6.3).

School Environment

Data on the number of crimes recorded and reported
by schools in 2009–10 were categorized by frequency
range as well. For example, 26 percent of schools
recorded zero violent crimes, and 19 percent of schools
recorded 20 or more violent crimes (figure 6.3 and
table 6.4). Sixty percent of schools did not report a
violent crime to the police, while 5 percent of schools
reported 20 or more violent crimes to the police. With
regard to serious violent crimes, 84 percent of schools
did not record a serious violent crime, and 2 percent
of schools recorded 10 or more such crimes. Ninety
percent of schools did not report a serious violent
crime to the police, and 1 percent of schools reported
10 or more serious violent crimes to the police (table
6.5). The number of crimes recorded by schools by
frequency range varied by school characteristics. A
larger percentage of city schools recorded 20 or more
violent incidents in 2009–10 than suburban schools
or rural schools (table 6.4). In 2009–10, this amounts
to about 25 percent of city schools recording 20 or
more violent incidents, compared with 19 percent
of suburban schools and 14 percent of rural schools.

Indicator 7
Discipline Problems Reported by Public Schools
During the 2009–10 school year, 23 percent of public schools reported that bullying occurred among students
on a daily or weekly basis, 9 percent reported student acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse
on a daily or weekly basis, and 5 percent reported that student verbal abuse of teachers occurred on a daily
or weekly basis. Sixteen percent reported gang activities during the school year.
In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school
principals were asked how often certain disciplinary
problems happened in their schools.22 This indicator
examines the daily or weekly occurrence of student
racial/ethnic tensions, bullying, sexual harassment of
other students, sexual harassment of other students
based on sexual orientation or gender identity, verbal
abuse of teachers, acts of disrespect for teachers other
than verbal abuse, and widespread disorder in the
classroom. It also looks at occurrences of gang and
cult or extremist group activities during the school
year. In the 2009–10 survey administration, schools
were also asked to report selected types of cyberbullying problems at school or away from school that
occurred daily or weekly.
During the 2009–10 school year, 23 percent of
public schools reported that bullying occurred
among students on a daily or weekly basis, and
9  percent reported student acts of disrespect for
teachers other than verbal abuse on a daily or weekly
basis (table 7.1). With regard to other discipline

problems reported as occurring at least once a week,
5 percent of schools reported student verbal abuse
of teachers, and 3 percent each reported student
racial/ethnic tensions, student sexual harassment of
other students, sexual harassment of other students
based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and
widespread disorder in classrooms. Sixteen percent
of public schools reported that gang activities
had happened at all during the 2009–10 school
year and 2 percent reported that cult or extremist
activities had happened at all during this period.
Discipline problems reported by public schools
varied by school characteristics. In 2009–10, a higher
percentage of city schools than rural schools and
suburban schools reported various types of discipline
problems (figure 7.1 and table 7.1). For example,
27 percent of city schools, compared with 21 percent
of rural schools and 20 percent of suburban schools,
reported that student bullying occurred at least once
a week.
Indicator 7 continued on page 36.

“At school” was defined for respondents to include activities
that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school
buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or

occurred before, during, or after normal school hours or when
school activities or events were in session.

In 2009–10, the percentage of middle schools
reporting student racial and ethnic tension (5 percent)
was higher than the percentage of high schools (3
percent) and primary schools (2 percent) that reported
student racial and ethnic tension (table 7.1). Schools
with an enrollment size of 1,000 or more reported
higher percentages of student racial and ethnic
tension (6 percent) than schools with an enrollment
size of 500–999 or 300–499 (3 percent each).
In addition, 10 percent of schools where 76 percent or
more of the students were eligible for free or reducedprice lunch reported the daily or weekly occurrence
of student verbal abuse of teachers, compared to 1
percent of schools where 25 percent or less of the
students were eligible.23
The percentages of public schools that reported the
occurrence of student bullying, student verbal abuse
of teachers, and student acts of disrespect for teachers
other than verbal abuse were greater in 1999–2000
than in 2009–10. For example, in 1999–2000,
approximately 29 percent of public schools reported
student bullying, compared with 23 percent of public
schools that reported student bullying in 2009–10.
Eleven percent of schools reported that student acts
of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse
occurred at least once a week in 2007–08, higher than
the 9 percent in 2009–10 (table 7.1). The percentage
of public schools that reported widespread disorder
in the classrooms decreased from 4 percent in

2007–08 to 3 percent in 2009–10. The percentages
of public schools that reported gang activity at all at
their schools during the school year decreased from
20 percent in 2007–08 to 16 percent in 2009–10
(table 7.1).
In 2009–10, the School Survey on Crime and Safety
included a questionnaire item on cyber-bullying
in which public schools were asked to report the
occurrence of cyber-bullying among students at
school and away from school.24 Eight percent of
public schools reported that cyber-bullying had
occurred among students daily or at least once a
week at school or away from school. Four percent
each of public schools also reported that the school
environment was affected by cyber-bullying and that
staff resources were used to deal with cyber-bullying
(table 7.2 and figure 7.2).
Public schools’ reports on the occurrence of cyberbullying at school and away from school in 2009–10
varied by school characteristics (table 7.2). Primary
schools reported lower percentages of cyber-bullying
among students (2 percent) than middle schools
(19 percent), high schools (18 percent), and combined
schools (13 percent). Thirteen percent of schools with
less than 5 percent combined enrollment of Black,
Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/
Alaska Native students reported cyber-bullying
among students, compared with 5 percent of schools
with 50 percent or more combined enrollment.

Students’ Reports of Gangs at School
The percentage of students ages 12–18 who reported that gangs were present at their school decreased from
18 percent in 2011 to 12 percent in 2013. A higher percentage of students from urban areas (18 percent)
reported a gang presence than students from suburban (11 percent) and rural areas (7 percent) in 2013.
In order to assess gang activity in and around the
vicinity of schools, the School Crime Supplement
to the National Crime Victimization Survey asked
students ages 12–18 if gangs were present at their
school25 during the school year. The percentage of
students ages 12–18 who reported that gangs were
present at their school decreased from 18 percent in
2011 to 12 percent in 2013 (figure 8.1 and table 8.1).
The percentage of students who reported a gang
presence has decreased every year since 2005, when
it was 24 percent.
In 2013, a higher percentage of students from urban
areas (18 percent) reported a gang presence at their
school than students from suburban (11 percent) and
rural areas (7 percent). Between 2011 and 2013, the
percentages of students from urban and suburban
areas who reported a gang presence at their school
both decreased (from 23 to 18 percent for students
from urban areas and from 16 to 11 percent for
students in suburban areas). There was no measurable
change in the percentage of rural students who
reported a gang presence at their school between
2011 and 2013.
A higher percentage of students attending public
schools (13 percent) than of students attending private
schools (2 percent) reported that gangs were present at
their school in 2013. The percentage of public school
students who reported a gang presence decreased from
19 percent in 2011 to 13 percent in 2013. However,
the percentage of private school students who reported
a gang presence at their school in 2013 was not
measurably different from the percentage in 2011.

In 2013, the percentages of male and female students
who reported a gang presence at their school were not
measurably different (13 and 12 percent, respectively).
Between 2011 and 2013, the percentage of male
students who reported a gang presence decreased
from 18 to 13 percent, and the percentage of female
students who reported a gang presence decreased from
17 to 12 percent.
Higher percentages of Hispanic (20 percent) and
Black (19 percent) students reported the presence
of gangs at their school than White (7 percent) and
Asian (9 percent) students (figure 8.2 and table 8.1).
The percentage of White students who reported a
gang presence decreased from 11 percent in 2011 to
7 percent in 2013. Similarly, between 2011 and 2013
the percentage of Black students who reported a gang
presence decreased from 33 to 19 percent, and the
percentage of Hispanic students decreased from 26
to 20 percent. The percentages reported in 2013 by
Asian students and students of other races/ethnicities
were not measurably different from the percentages
reported in 2011.
The percentages of students in 6th through 8th
grade who reported a gang presence at their school
were lower than the percentages for students in 9th
through 12th grade in 2013 (table 8.1). Five percent
of 6th-graders and 8 percent each of 7th- and 8thgraders reported the presence of gangs, compared
with 14 percent of 9th-graders, 15 percent of 12thgraders, 17 percent of 11th-graders, and 18 percent
of 10th-graders.

Students’ Reports of Illegal Drug Availability on School Property
The percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported that illegal drugs were offered, sold, or given to
them on school property increased from 1993 to 1995 (from 24 to 32 percent), but then decreased to 22
percent in 2013. The percentage of students who reported that illegal drugs were made available to them
on school property was lower in 2013 than in 2011 (22 vs. 26 percent).
In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades
9–12 were asked whether someone had offered, sold,
or given them an illegal drug on school property in
the 12 months preceding the survey.26 From 1993
to 1995 the percentage of students in grades 9–12
who reported that illegal drugs were made available
to them on school property increased (from 24 to
32 percent), but then decreased to 22 percent in
2013 (table 9.1). There was no measurable difference
between the percentages reported in 1993 and 2013.
However, the percentage of students who reported
that drugs were made available to them on school
property was lower in 2013 (22 percent) than in 2011
(26 percent; figure 9.1 and table 9.1).
In every survey year from 1993 to 2013, a lower
percentage of females than of males reported that
illegal drugs were offered, sold, or given to them on
school property. In 2013, some 20 percent of females
and 24 percent of males reported that illegal drugs
were made available to them on school property. The
percentage of males who reported that drugs were
offered, sold, or given to them on school property in
2013 was lower than the percentage reported in 2011
(29 percent). However, for females the percentage
reported in 2013 was not measurably different from
the percentage reported in 2011.
In 2013, lower percentages of Black students
(19 percent) and White students (20 percent) than of
Hispanic students (27 percent) and students of Two

26 

or more races (26 percent) reported that illegal drugs
were offered, sold, or given to them on school property
(figure 9.2 and table 9.1). In addition, the percentage
of Black students who reported that illegal drugs were
made available to them on school property was lower
than the percentage of Pacific Islander students (19 vs.
28 percent). Between 2011 and 2013, the percentages
of Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska
Native students who reported that illegal drugs were
made available to them on school property declined.
A lower percentage of 12th-graders than of 9th-,
10th-, or 11th-graders reported that illegal drugs
were made available to them on school property in
2013 (table 9.1). Nineteen percent of 12th-graders
reported that illegal drugs were made available to
them on school property that year, compared with
22 percent of 9th-graders and 23 percent each of
10th- and 11th-graders.
In 2013, public school student reports of the
availability of illegal drugs on school property
varied across the 36 states for which state-level data
were available (table 9.2). Among these states, the
percentage of students reporting that illegal drugs
were offered, sold, or given to them on school property
ranged from 12 percent in Mississippi to 33 percent
in New Mexico.

“On school property” was not defined for survey respondents.

Students’ Reports of Being Called Hate-Related Words and Seeing
Hate-Related Graffiti
In 2013, about 7 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being the target of hate-related words and
25 percent reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the school year; the corresponding 2011
percentages were both higher (9 and 28 percent, respectively).
The School Crime Supplement to the National Crime
Victimization Survey collects data on students’
reports of being the target of hate-related27 words and
seeing hate-related graffiti at school.28 Specifically,
students ages 12–18 were asked whether someone
at school had called them a derogatory word having
to do with their race, ethnicity, religion, disability,
gender, or sexual orientation. Additionally, students
were asked if they had seen hate-related graffiti at
their school—that is, hate-related words or symbols
written in classrooms, bathrooms, or hallways or on
the outside of the school building.
In 2013, about 7 percent of students ages 12–18
reported being the target of hate-related words at
school during the school year, which was lower than
the 9 percent reported in 2011 (figure 10.1 and table
10.1). The percentage of students who reported being
the target of hate-related words decreased from 12
percent in 2001 (the first year of data collection
for this item) to 7 percent in 2013. Similarly, in
2013, about 25 percent of students reported seeing
hate-related graffiti at school during the school year,
which was lower than the 28 percent reported in
2011, and also represented a decrease from the 36
percent reported in 1999, when data for students’
reports of seeing hate-related graffiti at school were
first collected.
The percentages of males and females who reported
being called a hate-related word during the school
year did not measurably differ in any survey year from
2001 to 2013. The percentages of male and female
students who reported being called a hate-related
word were lower in 2013 (7 percent each) than in

2011 (9 percent each). In addition, the percentages
of both males and females who reported being called
a hate-related word decreased overall between 2001
and 2013 (from 13 to 7 percent for males and from
12 to 7 percent for females).
The percentages of males and females who reported
seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the school
year did not measurably differ in any survey year
from 2001 to 2013. The percentage of male students
who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school was
lower in 2013 (24 percent) than in 2011 (29 percent),
as well as in 1999 (34 percent). The percentage of
female students who reported seeing hate-related
graffiti at school was lower in 2013 (25  percent)
than in 2011 (28 percent) and lower than in 1999
(39 percent).
In 2013, a lower percentage of White students than
students of any other race/ethnicity reported being
called a hate-related word during the school year.
About 5 percent of White students reported being
called a hate-related word, compared with 7 percent
of Hispanic students, 8 percent of Black students,
10 percent of Asian students, and 11 percent of
students of other races/ethnicities. There were no
measurable differences by race/ethnicity, however, in
the percentages of students who reported seeing haterelated graffiti at school in 2013. About 21 percent
of Asian students, 24 percent of White students,
26  percent each of Hispanic and Black students,
and 28 percent of students of other races/ethnicities
reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school.

Some measurable differences were observed across
grades in students’ reports of being called a haterelated word and seeing hate-related graffiti at
school in 2013 (figure 10.1 and table 10.1). In 2013,
a lower percentage of 12th-graders (4 percent) than
of 7th-, 8th-, and 9th-graders (7 percent each), and
11th-graders (8  percent) reported being called a
hate-related word at school. A lower percentage of
7th-graders (22 percent) reported seeing hate-rated
graffiti at school than 9th- and 10th-graders (27 and
26 percent, respectively).
In each data collection year between 1999 and 2013,
a higher percentage of public school students than of
private school students reported seeing hate-related
graffiti at school. For instance, in 2013, approximately
26 percent of public school students reported
seeing hate-related graffiti at school, compared with
13 percent of private school students. However, the
percentages of public and private school students
who reported being called a hate-related word were
not measurably different in 2013 (7 percent each).

44

School Environment

Students who reported being the target of haterelated words at school in 2013 were asked to indicate
whether the derogatory word they were called referred
to their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, or
sexual orientation (figure 10.2 and table 10.2). A lower
percentage of male students than of female students
reported being called a hate-related word referring
to their gender (less than one-half of 1 percent vs.
2 percent).
With respect to being called a hate-related word
referring to their race, a lower percentage of White
students than of their peers reported being targeted
in 2013 (table 10.2). Specifically, 2 percent of White
students reported being called a hate-related word
referring to their race, compared with 4 percent of
Hispanic students, 6 percent of Black students, and 8
percent each of Asian students and students of other
races/ethnicities.

Students who indicated that they had been called a hate-related word were asked to choose the specific characteristics that the hate-related word
or words targeted. Students were allowed to choose more than one characteristic. If a student chose more than one characteristic, he or she is
counted only once in the total percentage of students who reported being called a hate-related word; therefore, the total is less than the sum of the
students’ individual characteristics.
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and going to and from school. “Hate-related” refers to
derogatory terms used by others in reference to students’ personal characteristics.

Indicator 11
Bullying at School and Cyber-Bullying Anywhere
The percentage of students who reported being bullied was lower in 2013 (22 percent) than in every prior
survey year (28 percent each in 2005, 2009, and 2011 and 32 percent in 2007).
The School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the National
Crime Victimization Survey collects data on
bullying29 and cyber-bullying30 by asking students
ages 12–18 if they had been bullied at school 31
and cyber-bullied anywhere during the school
year. Students were also asked about the types and
frequencies of bullying and cyber-bullying they had
been subjected to, as well as whether an adult at
school32 had been notified of the incidents. Cyberbullying is distinct from bullying at school; however,
bullying at school might be a pertinent context to
understand cyber-bullying anywhere. In the SCS,
survey items on cyber-bullying anywhere were asked
separately from survey items on bullying at school.
In a different survey, the Youth Risk Behavior Survey
(YRBS), students in grades 9–12 were asked if they
had been bullied on school property33 or electronically
bullied during the previous 12 months. In addition
to collecting data at the national level, the YRBS also
collects data at the state level. Readers should take
note of the differing data sources and terminology.
On the SCS in 2013, about 22 percent of students
ages 12–18 reported being bullied at school during the
school year (figure 11.1 and table 11.1). Of students
ages 12–18, about 14 percent reported that they were
made fun of, called names, or insulted; 13 percent
reported being the subject of rumors; and 6 percent
29 
“Bullying” includes students who responded that another
student had made fun of them, called them names, or insulted
them; spread rumors about them; threatened them with harm;
tried to make them do something they did not want to do;
excluded them from activities on purpose; destroyed their
property on purpose; or pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on
them.
30 
“Cyber-bullying” includes students who responded that
another student had posted hurtful information about them on
the Internet; purposely shared private information about them
on the Internet; threatened or insulted them through instant
messaging; threatened or insulted them through text messaging;
threatened or insulted them through e-mail; threatened or
insulted them while gaming; or excluded them online.
31 
“At school” includes the school building, on school property,
on a school bus, or going to and from school.
32 
“Adult at school” refers to a teacher or other adult at school.
33 
In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), bullying was
defined for respondents as “when one or more students tease,
threaten, spread rumors about, hit, shove, or hurt another
student over and over again.” “On school property” was not
defined for survey respondents.

reported that they were pushed, shoved, tripped,
or spit on. Of those students who reported being
pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on at school, about
21 percent reported injury as a result of the incident.
Additionally, about 4 percent of all students reported
being excluded from activities on purpose, 4 percent
reported being threatened with harm, 2 percent
reported that others tried to make them do things
they did not want to do, and 2 percent reported that
their property was destroyed by others on purpose.
In 2013, a higher percentage of females than of males
ages 12–18 reported being bullied at school during
the school year (24 vs. 19 percent). Also, higher
percentages of females than of males reported that
they were made fun of, called names, or insulted
(15 vs. 13 percent); were the subject of rumors (17 vs.
10 percent); and were excluded from activities on
purpose (5 vs. 4 percent). In contrast, a higher
percentage of males (7 percent) than of females
(5 percent) reported being pushed, shoved, tripped,
or spit on.
A higher percentage of White students (24 percent)
than of Hispanic students (19 percent) and Asian
students (9 percent) reported being bullied at school
in 2013. In addition, higher percentages of Black
students (20 percent) and Hispanic students than
of Asian students reported being bullied at school.
A higher percentage of White students (16 percent)
than of Hispanic students (12 percent), Black
students (10 percent), and Asian students (7 percent)
reported being made fun of, called names, or insulted.
Similarly, 15 percent of White students reported that
they had been the subject of rumors, compared with
11 percent of Hispanic students and 4 percent of
Asian students.

Higher percentages of students in grades 6 through
11 than of students in grade 12 reported being
bullied at school during the school year. In 2013,
about 14   percent of 12th-graders reported being
bullied at school, compared with 28 percent of 6thgraders, 26 percent of 7th-graders, 22 percent of
8th-graders, 23 percent of 9th-graders, 19 percent
of 10th-graders, and 20 percent of 11th-graders.
No measurable differences were observed in the
percentage of students who reported being bullied
at school by school characteristics such as urbanicity
and control of school.
The SCS also asked students ages 12–18 who
reported being bullied at school to indicate the
location where they had been victimized. In 2013,
of students who reported being bullied during the
school year, about 46 percent of students reported
that the bullying occurred in the hallway or stairwell
at school, 34  percent reported being bullied inside
the classroom, and 23 percent reported being bullied
outside on school grounds (figure 11.2 and table
11.2). About 19 percent of students who were bullied
reported that the bullying occurred in the cafeteria,
9 percent reported that it occurred in the bathroom
or locker room, 8 percent reported that it occurred on
the school bus, and 1 percent reported that it occurred
somewhere else in school.
In 2013, approximately 7 percent of students ages
12–18 reported being cyber-bullied anywhere during
the school year (figure 11.3 and table 11.3). About

School Environment

3 percent of students reported that another student
had posted hurtful information about them on the
Internet, and 3 percent reported being the subject
of harassing text messages. Some 2 percent reported
being the subject of harassing instant messages
and 1 percent each reported having their private
information purposely shared on the Internet, being
the subject of harassing e-mails, being harassed while
gaming, and being excluded online.
A higher percentage of female students than of male
students ages 12–18 reported being victims of cyberbullying in 2013. Nine percent of females compared
with 5 percent of males were victims of cyber-bullying
overall. In particular, a higher percentage of females
than of males were victims of various types of cyberbullying: Having hurtful information about them
posted on the Internet by another student (5 vs.
1 percent), having their private information purposely
shared on the Internet (1 percent vs. less than one-half
of 1 percent), being the subject of harassing instant
messages (3 vs. 1 percent), and being the subject of
harassing text messages (5 vs. 2 percent). In contrast,
2 percent of male students reported being harassed
while gaming, compared with less than one-half of
1 percent of female students.

The percentage of students who reported being cyberbullied anywhere during the school year in 2013
was higher for White students (8 percent) than for
Black students (5 percent). There were no measurable
differences by grade level, urbanicity, or school sector
in the prevalence of students reporting being a victim
of cyber-bullying.
In 2013, about 33 percent of students who reported
being bullied at school indicated that they were
bullied at least once or twice a month during the
school year: 19 percent reported being bullied once
or twice a month, 8 percent reported being bullied
once or twice a week, and 6 percent reported being
bullied almost every day (figure 11.4 and table 11.4).
About 27  percent of students who reported being
cyber-bullied anywhere indicated that they were
cyber-bullied at least once or twice a month during
the school year: 15 percent reported being cyberbullied once or twice a month, 8 percent reported
being cyber-bullied once or twice a week, and
4 percent reported being cyber-bullied almost every
day. Among students who reported being cyberbullied, a higher percentage of females than of males
reported being cyber-bullied once or twice a month
(19 vs. 9 percent).

50

School Environment

Students who reported being bullied or cyber-bullied
were also asked whether they had notified an adult
about the incident. In 2013, a higher percentage
of students reported notifying an adult after being
bullied at school than after being cyber-bullied
anywhere (39 vs. 23 percent). While there was no
measurable difference by sex in the percentage of
students notifying an adult after being bullied at
school, a higher percentage of females than of males
reported notifying an adult after being cyber-bullied
(32 vs. 11 percent). In addition, higher percentages
of 6th- and 7th-graders than of 8th- through 12thgraders reported notifying an adult after being
bullied at school, and higher percentages of 7th- and
8th-graders than of 9th-graders reported notifying
an adult after being cyber-bullied. The percentage of
students who reported notifying an adult after being
bullied at school was higher for those who reported
being bullied once or twice a week (55 percent)
than for those who reported being bullied once or
twice a year (37 percent) or once or twice a month
(38 percent).

The percentages of students reporting being bullied
at school varied over time from 2005 through 2013.
Prior data are excluded from the time series due to
a significant redesign of the bullying items in 2005.
The percentage of students who reported being bullied
was lower in 2013 (22 percent) than in every prior
survey year (28 percent each in 2005, 2009, and
2011 and 32 percent in 2007; table 11.5). A similar
pattern was observed for some of the student and
school characteristics examined. For example, in 2013
about 24 percent of female students reported being
bullied at school, compared with 29 percent each in
2005 and 2009, about 31 percent in 2011, and 33
percent in 2007. Similarly, about 24 percent of White
students reported being bullied at school in 2013,
compared with 29 percent in 2009, about 30 percent
in 2005, about 31 percent in 2011, and 34 percent
in 2007. By school characteristics, in 2013 about 22
percent of students from suburban schools reported
being bullied at school, compared with 28 percent
in 2009, about 29 percent each in 2005 and 2011,
and 31 percent in 2007 (figure 11.5). Similarly, about

As mentioned in the introduction, the Youth Risk
Behavior Survey (YRBS) collects both national and
state-level data on bullying and electronic bullying for
students in grades 9–12. In 2013, both national and
state-level data on the percentages of students who
reported being bullied on school property during the
previous 12 months were available for 40 states (table
11.6). Among these states, the percentages of students
who reported being bullied on school property ranged
from 16 percent in Florida to 26 percent in Montana.
There were also 40 states that had 2013 data available
on the percentages of students who reported being
electronically bullied during the previous 12 months.
Among these states, the percentages of students
who reported being electronically bullied ranged
from 12 percent in Mississippi, Florida, and North
Carolina to 21 percent in Maine.

Indicator 12
Teachers’ Reports on School Conditions
In 2011–12, higher percentages of public school teachers than of private school teachers reported that student
misbehavior and student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching.
Managing inappropriate behaviors and classroom
disruptions is time-consuming and takes away from
valuable instructional time and student engagement
in academic behaviors (Riley, McKevitt, Shriver,
and Allen 2011). In the Schools and Staffing Survey
(SASS), public and private school teachers were
asked whether student misbehavior and student
tardiness and class cutting interfered with their
teaching. During the 2011–12 school year, 38 percent
of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that student
misbehavior interfered with their teaching, and
35 percent reported that student tardiness and class
cutting interfered with their teaching (figure 12.1
and table 12.1). Teachers were also asked whether
school rules were enforced by other teachers at their
school, even for students not in their classes, and
whether school rules were enforced by the principal.
In 2011–12, about 69 percent of teachers agreed or
strongly agreed that other teachers at their school
enforced the school rules, and 84 percent reported
that the principal enforced the school rules (figure
12.1 and table 12.2).
The percentages of teachers who reported that
student misbehavior and student tardiness and
class cutting interfered with their teaching varied
by school characteristics during the 2011–12 school
year (table 12.1). For example, a higher percentage
of public school teachers (41 percent) than of private
school teachers (22 percent) reported that student
misbehavior interfered with their teaching. Thirtyeight percent of public school teachers reported that
student tardiness and class cutting interfered with
their teaching, compared with 19 percent of private
school teachers.
In every survey year, a lower percentage of elementary
school teachers than of secondary school teachers
reported that student tardiness and class cutting

interfered with their teaching; in 2011–12,
31 percent of elementary school teachers and
45 percent of secondary school teachers reported that
student tardiness and class cutting interfered with
their teaching (table 12.1). There was no measurable
difference between the percentages of elementary and
secondary school teachers who reported that student
misbehavior interfered with their teaching.
The percentage of teachers who reported that student
misbehavior interfered with their teaching fluctuated
between 1993–94 and 2011–12; however, the
percentage was higher in 2011–12 (38 percent) than
in the previous survey year (34 percent in 2007–08;
figure 12.2). The percentage of teachers reporting
that student tardiness and class cutting interfered
with their teaching increased between 1993–94 and
2011–12 (from 25 to 35 percent). A higher percentage
of teachers reported that student tardiness and class
cutting interfered with their teaching in 2011–12
than in 2007–08 (35 vs. 31 percent).
In every survey year, a lower percentage of public
school teachers than of private school teachers agreed
that school rules were enforced by other teachers
and by the principal in their school (table 12.2). In
2011–12, some 68 percent of public school teachers
reported that school rules were enforced by other
teachers, compared with 77 percent of private school
teachers. In addition, 84 percent of public school
teachers reported that school rules were enforced by
the principal, compared with 89 percent of private
school teachers.

Between 1993–94 and 2011–12, the percentage of
teachers who agreed or strongly agreed that school
rules were enforced by other teachers fluctuated
between 64 and 73 percent, and the percentage who
agreed that rules were enforced by the principal
fluctuated between 82 and 89 percent, showing no
consistent trends. However, a lower percentage of
teachers reported that school rules were enforced
by other teachers in 2011–12 (69 percent) than in
the previous survey year (72 percent in 2007–08).
Similarly, the percentage of teachers who reported
that school rules were enforced by the principal
was lower in 2011–12 than in 2007–08 (84 vs.
89 percent).

56

School Environment

In 2011–12, the percentages of public school teachers
who reported that student misbehavior and student
tardiness and class cutting interfered with their
teaching varied by state. For example, among the 50
states and the District of Columbia, the percentage
of teachers who reported that student misbehavior
interfered with their teaching ranged from 31 percent
in Wyoming to 55 percent in Louisiana (table 12.3).
The percentages of teachers who reported that school
rules were enforced by other teachers and by the
principal also varied by state.

Indicator 13
Physical Fights on School Property and Anywhere
The percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported being in a physical fight anywhere decreased between
1993 and 2013 (from 42 to 25 percent), and the percentage of students in these grades who reported being
in a physical fight on school property also decreased during this period (from 16 to 8 percent).
In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in
grades 9–12 were asked about their involvement in
physical fights in general (referred to as “anywhere”
in this indicator),34 as well as about their involvement
in physical fights on school property, during the
12 months preceding the survey.35 In this indicator,
percentages of students reporting involvement in
fights occurring anywhere are used as a point of
comparison with percentages of students reporting
involvement in fights occurring on school property.
Overall, the percentage of students in grades 9–12
who reported being in a physical fight anywhere
decreased between 1993 and 2013 (from 42 to
25 percent), and the percentage of students in these
grades who reported being in a physical fight on
school property also decreased during this period
(from 16 to 8 percent; figure 13.1 and table 13.1). The
percentage of students in these grades who reported
being in a physical fight anywhere was lower in 2013
(25 percent) than in 2011 (33 percent); the percentage
of those who reported being in a physical fight on
school property was also lower in 2013 (8 percent)
than in 2011 (12 percent).
From 1993 through 2013, the percentages of students
in grades 9–12 who reported being in a physical
fight anywhere as well as a physical fight on school
property decreased for all four grade levels. The 2013
percentages of 12th-graders who reported being in a
physical fight, either anywhere or on school property,
were lower than the percentages reported by 9th-,
10th-, and 11th-graders. In 2013, about 19 percent
of 12th-graders reported being in a physical fight
anywhere, compared with 28 percent of 9th-graders,
26 percent of 10th-graders, and 24 percent of
11th-graders. Similarly, 5 percent of 12th-graders,
compared with 11 percent of 9th-graders, 8 percent of
10th-graders, and 7 percent of 11th-graders reported
being in a physical fight on school property.
34 

“Anywhere” includes on school property.
The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior
Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked
how many times in the past 12 months they had been in a
physical fight. In the question asking students about physical
fights at school, “on school property” was not defined for
survey respondents.
35 

The percentages of 9th- to 12th-graders who reported
being in a physical fight in 2013 differed by race/
ethnicity. For example, a higher percentage of Black
students (35 percent) than of students of Two or more
races (29 percent), Hispanic students (28 percent),
Pacific Islander students (22 percent), White students
(21 percent), and Asian students (16 percent) reported
being in a physical fight anywhere (figure 13.2
and table 13.1). In addition, higher percentages of
Hispanic students and students of Two or more races
than of White students and Asian students reported
being in a physical fight anywhere. With regard to
the involvement of 9th- to 12th-graders in physical
fights on school property, the same patterns by race/
ethnicity were observed. The percentage of students
who reported being in a physical fight on school
property was higher for Black students (13 percent)
than for students of Two or more races (10 percent),
Hispanic students (9 percent), Pacific Islander
students (7 percent), White students (6 percent), and
Asian students (5 percent), and the percentages were
higher for students of Two or more races and Hispanic
students than for White students and Asian students.
Between 1993 and 2013, the percentage of students
in grades 9–12 who reported being in a physical
fight anywhere decreased for White students (from
40 to 21 percent), Hispanic students (from 43 to
28 percent), and American Indian/Alaska Native
students (from 50 to 32 percent). During the same
period, the percentage of students in grades 9–12 who
reported being in a physical fight on school property
decreased for White students (from 15 to 6 percent),
Black students (from 22 to 13 percent), and Hispanic
students (from 18 to 9 percent). The percentages of
Asian students who reported being in a physical fight
anywhere and on school property both decreased
between 1999 (the first year separate data on Asian
and Pacific Islander students were available) and
2013. The percentage of Pacific Islander students who
reported being in a physical fight on school property
also decreased between 1999 and 2013.

Students in grades 9–12 were also asked how often
they had been in physical fights during the previous
12 months. In 2013, about 19 percent of students
in these grades reported being in a physical fight
anywhere 1 to 3 times, 4 percent reported being in a
physical fight anywhere 4 to 11 times, and 2 percent
reported being in a physical fight anywhere 12 or
more times (figure 13.3 and table 13.2) during the
12-month period. When students in these grades were
asked about the incidence of physical fights on school
property during the 12-month period, 7  percent
reported being in a physical fight on school property
1 to 3 times, 1 percent reported being in a physical
fight on school property 4 to 11 times, and less than
1 percent reported being in a physical fight on school
property 12 or more times.
The percentages of both male and female 9th- to
12th-graders who reported being in a physical fight
both anywhere and on school property decreased
between 1993 and 2013. About 30 percent of male
students reported being in a physical fight anywhere
in 2013 compared with 51 percent in 1993, and 11
percent reported being in a physical fight on school
property in 2013 compared with 24 percent in 1993.
About 19 percent of female students reported being
in a physical fight anywhere in 2013 compared with
32 percent in 1993, and 6 percent reported being in
a physical fight on school property in 2013 compared
with 9 percent in 1993.
In 2013, a higher percentage of male than of female
9th- to 12th-graders reported being in a physical fight

60

Fights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances

during the previous 12 months (30 vs. 19 percent;
figure 13.3 and table 13.1). The reported frequency
of fights involving students in these grades was also
higher for males than for females (table 13.2). A
higher percentage of males than of females reported
being in a physical fight anywhere 1 to 3 times (22
vs. 16 percent), 4 to 11 times (5 vs. 3 percent), and 12
or more times (3 vs. 1 percent) during the 12-month
period. Similar to the frequency of fights anywhere, in
2013, a higher percentage of males than of females in
grades 9 through 12 reported that they had been in a
physical fight on school property during the previous
12 months (11 vs. 6 percent). Additionally, a higher
percentage of males than of females reported being
in a physical fight on school property 1 to 3 times (9
vs. 5 percent), 4 to 11 times (1 percent vs. less than
1 percent), and 12 or more times (1 percent vs. less
than 1 percent).
Data for the percentage of public school students who
reported being in a physical fight anywhere in 2013
were available for 37 states, and data for physical
fights on school property involving these students
were available for 35 states. Among these states,
the percentages of students who reported being in a
physical fight anywhere ranged from 17 percent in
Hawaii and Maine to 31 percent in Louisiana and
Mississippi, and the percentages of students who
reported being in a physical fight on school property
ranged from 5 percent in Massachusetts to 14 percent
in Mississippi and Maryland (table 13.3).

Indicator 14
Students Carrying Weapons on School Property and Anywhere
and Students’ Access to Firearms
Between 1993 and 2013, the percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported carrying a weapon on
school property 1 day during the previous 30 days declined from 12 to 5 percent. A higher percentage of
male students than of female students reported they had carried a weapon, both anywhere and on school
property, in every survey year from 1993 to 2013.
This indicator uses data from the Youth Risk Behavior
Survey (YRBS) to discuss students’ carrying of
weapons on school property and anywhere, then
uses state data from the EDFacts data collection to
discuss the numbers of incidents involving students
with firearms at school by state, and concludes with a
discussion of data from the School Crime Supplement
(SCS) survey on students’ access to firearms at school
or away from school. Readers should take note of the
differing data sources and terminology.
In the YRBS, students were asked if they had carried
a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club anywhere in
the previous 30 days and if they had carried such a
weapon on school property during the same time
period.36 In this indicator, the percentage of students
carrying a weapon “anywhere”37 is included as a
point of comparison with the percentage of students
carrying a weapon on school property.
In 2013, some 18 percent of students in grades 9–12
reported that they had carried a weapon anywhere
at least 1 day during the previous 30 days: 9 percent
reported carrying a weapon anywhere on 6 or more
days, 6 percent reported carrying a weapon on 2 to
5 days, and 3 percent reported carrying a weapon on
1 day (tables 14.1 and 14.2). In comparison, 5 percent
of students reported carrying a weapon on school
property at least 1 day during the previous 30 days.
This percentage was composed of the 3 percent of
students who reported carrying a weapon on 6 or
more days, the 1 percent of students who reported
carrying a weapon on 2 to 5 days, and the 1 percent
of students who reported carrying a weapon on 1 day
during the 30-day period.
The percentage of students who reported carrying a
weapon on school property in the previous 30 days
36 

The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior
Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how
many days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days. In the
question asking students about carrying a weapon at school, “on
school property” was not defined for survey respondents.
37 
“Anywhere” includes on school property.

declined from 12 percent in 1993 to 5 percent in 2013
(figure 14.1 and table 14.1). The percentage of students
who reported carrying weapons anywhere was lower
in 2013 (18 percent) than in 1993 (22 percent) or 1995
(20 percent). There were no measurable differences
between the 2011 and 2013 percentages of students
who reported carrying a weapon either anywhere or
on school property during the previous 30 days.
In every survey year from 1993 to 2013, a higher
percentage of male students than of female students
reported that they had carried a weapon, both
anywhere and on school property. In 2013, for
example, 28 percent of male students reported
carrying a weapon anywhere, compared with 8
percent of female students. In addition, 8 percent of
male students reported carrying a weapon on school
property, compared with 3 percent of female students.
In 2013, the percentage of White students who
reported carrying a weapon anywhere in the previous
30 days (21 percent) was higher than the percentages
of Hispanic students (16 percent), Pacific Islander and
Black students (13 percent each), and Asian students
(9 percent) who reported doing so (figure 14.2 and
table 14.1). In addition, higher percentages of students
of Two or more races (19 percent) and Hispanic
students than of Black students and Asian students
reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the
period. The percentage of American Indian/Alaska
Native students (18 percent) who reported carrying a
weapon anywhere was also higher than the percentage
of Asian students. With respect to students reporting
that they carried a weapon on school property during
the previous 30 days, a higher percentage of White
students (6 percent) than of Black students (4 percent)
reported that they had carried a weapon during the
previous 30 days.

NOTE: Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days. In the question asking students about carrying a
weapon at school, “on school property” was not defined for survey respondents. Respondents were asked about carrying “a weapon such as a gun,
knife, or club.”

There were no measurable differences by grade in
the percentages of students who reported carrying
a weapon anywhere or on school property at least
1 day during the previous 30 days in 2013: About
18 percent of students at each of grade levels 9 through
12 reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the
previous 30 days, and 5 percent each of 9th-, 10th‑,
and 12th-graders and 6 percent of 11th-graders
reported carrying a weapon on school property.
However, a higher percentage of 12th-graders
(11 percent) than of 9th- and 10th-graders (8 percent
each) reported carrying a weapon anywhere on 6 or
more days during the previous 30 days (table 14.2).
In 2013, state-level data on percentages of public
school students who reported carrying a weapon
anywhere were available for 34 states (table 14.3).
Among these states, the percentages of students who
reported carrying a weapon anywhere ranged from
10 percent in New Jersey and Hawaii to 29 percent
in Wyoming. There were also 34 states that had 2013
data available on the percentages of students reporting
that they carried a weapon on school property during
the previous 30 days; the percentages ranged from
3 percent in New Jersey, Delaware, Massachusetts,
Wisconsin, and Nevada to 10 percent in Montana,
Wyoming, and Vermont.
Reported incidents involving students who brought
or possessed firearms at school are also important to
examine. As part of the EDFacts data collection, state
education agencies report the number of incidents
involving students who brought or possessed firearms
at school. State education agencies compile these data
based on incidents that were reported by their schools
and school districts. During the 2012–13 school year,
there were 1,556 reported firearm possession incidents
at school in the United States (table 14.5). The total
number of incidents varied widely across states,
due in large part to the differing populations at the
state level. Therefore, the ratio of firearm possession
incidents per 100,000 students can provide a more
comparable indication of the frequency of these
incidents across states. During the 2012–13 school
year, the ratio of firearm possession incidents per
100,000 students in the United States was 3.1.
The majority of states had ratios between 1.0 and 10.0
firearm possession incidents per 100,000 students
from 2008–09 to 2012–13. During the 2012–13
school year, eight states and the District of Columbia
had ratios of firearm possession incidents per 100,000
students that were at or below 1.0. The eight states
were: Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New
Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and West
64

Fights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances

Virginia. All of these states, with the exception of West
Virginia, had ratios of firearm incidents per 100,000
students that were at or below 1.0 in the 2011–12
school year as well. During the 2012–13 school
year, three states had ratios above 10.0: Arkansas,
Missouri, and Wyoming. However, only one of these
states, Arkansas, also had a ratio above 10.0 during
the 2011–12 school year. During 2011–12, Utah was
the only other state with a ratio above 10.0 firearm
possession incidents per 100,000 students.
Information about students’ access to firearms can
put student reports of carrying a gun anywhere and
on school property into context. In the SCS survey,
students were asked if they could have gotten a loaded
gun without adult permission, either at school or
away from school, during the current school year.
In 2013, about 4 percent of students ages 12–18
reported having access to a loaded gun without adult
permission, either at school or away from school,
during the current school year (figure 14.3 and table
14.4). The percentage of 12- to 18-year-old students
reporting that they had access to a loaded gun without
adult permission decreased from 7 percent in 2007
(the first year of data collection for this item) to
4 percent in 2013. There was no measurable difference
between the percentages who reported having such
access to a loaded gun between 2011 and 2013.
In every survey year from 2007 to 2011, a higher
percentage of male students than of female students
ages 12–18 reported having access to a loaded gun
without adult permission. However, there was no
measurable difference between the percentages of
male and female students who reported having such
access to a loaded gun in 2013. The percentage of
male students who reported having access to a loaded
gun without adult permission was lower in 2013
than in 2011 (4 vs. 6 percent). The percentages of
female students who reported having such access to
a loaded gun were not measurably different between
these two years.
In 2013, higher percentages of 10th-, 11th-, and
12th‑graders reported having access to a loaded
gun without adult permission than did 7th- and
8th‑graders. About 5 percent of 10th-graders and
6 percent each of 11th- and 12th-graders reported
having access to a loaded gun without adult
supervision, compared with 2 percent each of 7thand 8th-graders. The percentage of 11th-graders
reporting that they had access to a gun without adult
supervision was also higher than the percentage of
9th-graders reporting such access (3 percent).

Indicator 15
Students’ Use of Alcohol on School Property and Anywhere
Between 1993 and 2013, the percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported having at least one
drink of alcohol during the previous 30 days decreased from 48 to 35 percent. The percentage who reported
consuming alcohol in 2013 was lower than the percentage in 2011 (39 percent). In 2011, some 5 percent
of students in grades 9–12 reported having at least one drink of alcohol on school property.
In the 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in
grades 9–12 were asked if they had consumed alcohol
on at least 1 day during the previous 30 days. Prior to
2013, students were also asked if they had consumed
alcohol on school property38 during the previous
30 days. Due to this change in the questionnaire,
this indicator differs from previous editions: it first
discusses results on alcohol consumption anywhere
using data up to 2013 and then discusses students’
reports of alcohol consumption on school property
using data up to 2011.
Between 1993 and 2013, the percentage of students
in grades 9–12 who reported having at least one drink
of alcohol during the previous 30 days decreased
from 48 to 35 percent (figure 15.1 and table 15.1).
Additionally, the percentage who reported consuming
alcohol in 2013 was lower than the percentage in 2011
(39 percent). In 2013, about 17 percent of students
in grades 9–12 reported consuming alcohol on
1 or 2 days during the previous 30 days, 17 percent
reported consuming alcohol on 3 to 29 of the previous
30 days, and 1 percent reported consuming alcohol on
all of the previous 30 days (table 15.2). The percentage
of students who reported consuming alcohol on
1 or 2 days was lower in 2013 than in 2011 (17 vs.
19 percent).
In every survey year between 1993 and 2001, except
in 1995, a higher percentage of males than of females
reported consuming alcohol on at least 1 day during
the previous 30 days. However, in the survey years
since 2003, there have been no measurable differences
between the percentages of male and female students
who reported consuming alcohol on at least 1 of the
previous 30 days. Nevertheless, there were differences
by sex in the number of days students reported

consuming alcohol in 2013. A higher percentage of
females than of males reported consuming alcohol
on 1 or 2 days (19 vs. 16 percent). In contrast, a
higher percentage of males than of females reported
consuming alcohol on all of the previous 30 days
(1 percent vs. less than one-half of 1 percent; figure
15.2 and table 15.2).
In 2013, the percentage of students who reported
consuming alcohol increased with grade level. About
47 percent of 12th-graders reported consuming
alcohol on at least 1 day during the previous
30 days (figure 15.3 and table 15.1). This percentage
was higher than the percentages for 9th-graders
(24  percent), 10th-graders (31 percent), and
11th-graders (39 percent). Additionally, higher
percentages of Hispanic students (37 percent), White
students and students of Two or more races (36 percent
each), American Indian/Alaska Native students
(33 percent), and Black students (30 percent) than
of Asian students (22 percent) reported consuming
alcohol at least 1 day during the previous 30 days in
2013. The percentage of Black students who reported
consuming alcohol at least 1 day was lower than the
percentages reported by White students, Hispanic
students, and students of Two or more races.
In 2013, state-level data on the percentages of students
who reported consuming alcohol were available
for 41  states (table 15.3). Among these states, the
percentages of students who reported drinking
alcohol on at least 1 day during the previous 30 days
ranged from 11 percent in Utah to 39 percent in
Louisiana and New Jersey.

In the question about drinking alcohol at school, “on school
property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term
“anywhere” was not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey
(YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many
days during the previous 30 days they had at least one drink
of  alcohol.

Prior to 2013, data were also collected on student
alcohol consumption on school property during the
previous 30 days. In 2011, some 5 percent of students
in grades 9–12 reported having at least one drink of
alcohol on school property, which was not measurably
different from the percentage in 1993 (figure 15.1 and
table 15.1). About 3 percent of students reported using
alcohol on school property on 1 or 2 of the previous
30 days in 2011. One percent of students reported
using alcohol on school property on 3 to 29 of the
previous 30 days, and one-half percent of students
reported using alcohol on school property on all of
the previous 30 days (table 15.2).

Indicator 16
Students’ Use of Marijuana on School Property and Anywhere
In 2013, some 23 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported using marijuana at least one time in the
previous 30 days, which was higher than the percentage reported in 1993 (18 percent). In 2011, some 6
percent of students reported using marijuana at least one time on school property.
The 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey asked students
in grades 9–12 whether they had used marijuana in
the previous 30 days. Prior to 2013, students were
also asked whether they had used marijuana on school
property39 in the previous 30 days. Due to this change
in the questionnaire, this indicator differs from
previous editions; it first discusses students’ reports of
marijuana use anywhere using data up to 2013, and
then discusses students’ reports of marijuana use on
school property using data up to 2011.
In 2013, some 23 percent of students in grades
9–12 reported using marijuana at least one time in
the previous 30 days, which was higher than the
percentage reported in 1993 (18 percent) but not
measurably different from that reported in 2011
(figure 16.1 and table 16.1). In 2013, about 7 percent
of students in grades 9–12 reported using marijuana
1 or 2 times during the previous 30 days, 11 percent
reported using marijuana 3 to 39 times during the
previous 30 days, and 5 percent reported using
marijuana 40 or more times during the previous 30
days (table 16.2).
In every survey year between 1993 and 2011, higher
percentages of male students than of female students
reported using marijuana at least one time in the
previous 30 days; in 2013, there was no measurable
difference in the percentages reported by male and
female students (25 and 22 percent, respectively;
figure  16.1 and table 16.1). However, a higher
percentage of males (7 percent) than of females
(3 percent) reported using marijuana 40 or more times
during the previous 30 days in 2013 (figure 16.2 and
table 16.2).

In 2013, some differences in the percentages of
students who reported marijuana use were observed
by race/ethnicity and grade level. The percentages
of Asian students (16 percent) and White students
(20 percent) who reported using marijuana during
the previous 30 days were lower than the percentages
reported by Hispanic students (28 percent), Black
students and students of Two or more races (29 percent
each), and American Indian/Alaska Native students
(36 percent; figure 16.3 and table 16.1). In addition,
the percentage of students in 9th grade (18 percent)
who reported using marijuana was lower than the
percentages of students in 10th grade (23 percent),
11th grade (26 percent), and 12th grade (28 percent)
who reported doing so.
In 2013, state-level data for students who reported
using marijuana at least one time in the previous
30  days were available for 42 states (table 16.3).
Among these states, the percentages of students who
reported using marijuana ranged from 8 percent in
Utah to 28 percent in New Mexico.

Prior to 2013, data were also collected on students’
marijuana use on school property during the previous
30 days. Some 6 percent of students reported using
marijuana at least one time on school property in
2011; this was not measurably different from the
percentage reported in 1993 but was higher than
the percentage reported in 2009 (5 percent; figure
16.1  and table 16.1). In 2011, about 3 percent of
students reported using marijuana on school property
1 or 2 times in the previous 30 days, about 2 percent
reported using marijuana 3 to 39 times during the
previous 30 days, and 1 percent reported using
marijuana 40 or more times during the previous
30 days (table 16.2).
In every survey year between 1993 and 2011, higher
percentages of male students than of female students
reported using marijuana on school property at least
one time in the previous 30 days (figure 16.1 and
table 16.1). For example, 8 percent of male students
reported using marijuana on school property in
2011, compared with 4 percent of female students.

Fights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances

In 2011, a higher percentage of American Indian/
Alaska Native students (21 percent) than of students
from most other racial/ethnic groups reported using
marijuana on school property at least one time in the
previous 30 days. Additionally, a higher percentage
of Hispanic students (8 percent) than of White
or Asian students (5 and 4 percent, respectively)
reported using marijuana on school property, and
a higher percentage of Black students (7 percent)
than of White students reported doing so. There
were no measurable differences by grade level in the
percentages of students reporting marijuana use on

In 2011, state-level data for students who reported
using marijuana on school property at least one time
in the previous 30 days were available for 36 states and
the District of Columbia (table 16.3). Among these
states, the percentages of students who reported using
marijuana on school property ranged from 2 percent
in Oklahoma to 10 percent in New Mexico.

Students’ Perceptions of Personal Safety at School and Away
From School
The percentage of students who reported being afraid of attack or harm at school decreased from 12 percent
in 1995 to 3 percent in 2013, and the percentage of students who reported being afraid of attack or harm
away from school decreased from 6 percent in 1999 to 3 percent in 2013.
In the School Crime Supplement to the National
Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18
were asked how often40 they had been afraid of
attack or harm “at school or on the way to and from
school” as well as “away from school.”41 In 2013,
about 3 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that
they were afraid of attack or harm at school or on the
way to and from school during the school year (figure
17.1 and table 17.1). Similarly, 3 percent of students
ages 12–18 reported that they were afraid of attack
or harm away from school during the school year.
Between 1995 and 2013, the percentages of students
who reported being afraid of attack or harm at school
decreased overall (from 12 to 3 percent), as well as
among male students (from 11 to 3 percent) and
female students (from 13 to 4 percent; figure 17.1).
In addition, the percentage of students who reported
being afraid of attack or harm at school decreased
between 1995 and 2013 for White students (from
8 to 3 percent), Black students (from 20 to 5 percent),
and Hispanic students (from 21 to 5 percent).
A declining trend was also observed for away from
school: between 1999 (the first year of data collection
for this item) and 2013, the percentage of students
who reported being afraid of attack or harm decreased
from 6 to 3 percent overall, from 4 to 2 percent for
male students, and from 7 to 3 percent for female
students. The percentages of White students (from
4 to 2 percent), Black students (from 9 to 4 percent),
and Hispanic students (from 9 to 4 percent) who
reported being afraid of attack or harm away from
school also decreased during this period. Between
the two most recent survey years, 2011 and 2013,
no measurable differences were found in the overall
percentages of students who reported being afraid of
attack or harm, either at school or away from school.

In 2013, higher percentages of Black and Hispanic
students (5 percent each) than of White students
(3 percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm
at school (table 17.1). Similarly, higher percentages of
Black and Hispanic students (4 percent each) than
of White students (2 percent) reported being afraid
of attack or harm away from school.
Higher percentages of 6th-graders (5 percent) and
7th- and 10th-graders (4 percent each) reported
being afraid of attack or harm at school than
did 12th-graders (2 percent) in 2013. Likewise,
higher percentages of 6th-, 9th-, and 10th-graders
(3 to 4  percent each) reported being afraid of attack
or harm away from school than did 12th-graders
(1 percent).
In 2013, higher percentages of students in urban
areas than of students in suburban areas reported
being afraid of attack or harm both at school and
away from school (figure 17.2). Specifically, 4 percent
of students in urban areas reported being afraid of
attack or harm at school, compared with 3 percent
of students in suburban areas. Similarly, 4 percent
of students in urban areas reported being afraid of
attack or harm away from school, higher than the
2 percent of students in suburban areas. In addition,
a higher percentage of students in urban areas than of
students in rural areas reported being afraid of attack
or harm away from school (4 vs. 2 percent). There were
no measurable differences between the percentages
of public school and private school students who
reported being afraid of attack or harm at school or
away from school in 2013.

40 
Students were asked if they “never,” “almost never,”
“sometimes,” or “most of the time” feared that someone would
attack or harm them at school or away from school. Students
responding “sometimes” or “most of the time” were considered
fearful. For the 2001 survey only, the wording was changed from
“attack or harm” to “attack or threaten to attack.”
41 
“At school” includes the school building, on school property,
on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and
from school.

Starting in 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period was the previous 6 months.
Cognitive testing showed that estimates from 2007 onward are comparable to previous years.
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. Students
were asked if they “never,” “almost never,” “sometimes,” or “most of the time” feared that someone would attack or harm them at school or away
from school. Students responding “sometimes” or “most of the time” were considered fearful. For the 2001 survey only, the wording was changed
from “attack or harm” to “attack or threaten to attack.” Data on fear of attack or harm away from school were not collected in 1995. For more

Indicator 18
Students’ Reports of Avoiding School Activities or Classes or
Specific Places in School
In 2013, about 5 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they avoided school activities or classes or
one or more places in school because they thought someone might attack or harm them.
The School Crime Supplement to the National
Crime Victimization Survey asked students ages 12–
18 whether they avoided school activities or classes42
or one or more places in school43 because they were
fearful that someone might attack or harm them.44
In 2013, about 5 percent of students reported that
they avoided at least one school activity or class or
one or more places in school during the previous
school year because they feared being attacked or
harmed. Specifically, 2 percent of students reported
avoiding at least one school activity or class, and
about 4 percent reported avoiding one or more places
in school (figure 18.1 and table 18.1).
There was no overall pattern of increase or decrease
between 1999 and 2013 in the percentage of students
who reported that they avoided at least one school
activity or class or one or more places in school
because of fear of attack or harm. The percentage in
2013 (5 percent) was lower than the percentage in
1999 (7 percent) but not measurably different from
the percentage in 2011.

In 2013, about 1 percent each of students reported
that they avoided any activities, avoided any classes,
and stayed home from school. With respect to
avoiding specific places in school, 2 percent of
students reported that they avoided the hallways or
stairs in school, and 1 percent each reported that
they avoided parts of the school cafeteria, any school
restrooms, the entrance to the school, and other places
inside the school building.
Students’ reports of avoiding one or more places
in school because of fear of attack or harm varied
by some student and school characteristics in 2013
(figure 18.2). A higher percentage of Hispanic
students (5  percent) than of White students
(3 percent) reported avoiding one or more places in
school. By grade, higher percentages of 7th-graders
and 9th-graders (5 percent each) than of 8th-graders
(3 percent), 11th-graders (3 percent), or 12th-graders
(2 percent) reported avoiding one or more places in
school. Also, a higher percentage of public school
students (4 percent) than of private school students
(1 percent) reported avoiding one or more places
in  school.

42 
“Avoided school activities or classes” includes student reports
of three activities: avoiding any (extracurricular) activities,
avoiding any classes, or staying home from school. Before 2007,
students were asked whether they avoided “any extracurricular
activities.” Starting in 2007, the survey wording was changed
to “any activities.” Caution should be used when comparing
changes in this item over time.
43 
“Avoiding one or more places in school” includes student
reports of five activities: avoiding the entrance, any hallways or
stairs, parts of the cafeteria, restrooms, and other places inside
the school building.
44 
For the 2001 survey only, the wording was changed from
“attack or harm” to “attack or threaten to attack.” See appendix
A for more information.

Serious Disciplinary Actions Taken by Public Schools
During the 2009–10 school year, 39 percent of public schools took at least one serious disciplinary action
against a student for specific offenses. A total of 433,800 serious disciplinary actions were taken by public
schools during this period.
In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public
school principals were asked to report the number
of disciplinary actions their schools had taken
against students for specific offenses. The student
offenses were physical attacks or fights; distribution,
possession, or use of alcohol; distribution, possession,
or use of illegal drugs; use or possession of a firearm
or explosive device; and use or possession of a weapon
other than a firearm or explosive device.
During the 2009–10 school year, 39 percent of public
schools (32,300 schools) took at least one serious
disciplinary action—including suspensions lasting
5 days or more, removals with no services for the
remainder of the school year (i.e., expulsions), and
transfers to specialized schools—for specific offenses
(table 19.1).
Out of all offenses reported, physical attacks or
fights prompted the largest percentage of schools
(29 percent) to respond with at least one serious
disciplinary action (figure 19.1 and table 19.1). In
response to other offenses by students, 20 percent of
schools reported that they took disciplinary action for
the distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs;
13 percent took action for the use or possession of
a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device;
9 percent did so for the distribution, possession, or
use of alcohol; and 3 percent did so for the use or
possession of a firearm or explosive device.
No linear trends were detected in the percentages
of schools that took at least one serious disciplinary
action for any of the reported offenses over time
between 2003–04 and 2009–10, although the
percentage of schools taking at least one serious
disciplinary action for physical attacks or fights
declined between 1999–2000 (35 percent) and
2009–10 (29 percent).

During the 2009–10 school year, the percentage of
public schools that took serious disciplinary actions
increased with school level. A higher percentage
of high schools (83 percent) took at least one
serious disciplinary action than did middle schools
(67  percent) and primary schools (18 percent).
Combined schools (schools that provide instruction
at both elementary and secondary grades) took
at least one serious disciplinary action at a higher
percentage (49 percent) than primary schools, but at
a lower percentage than either middle schools or high
schools. This pattern by school level was generally
observed for disciplinary actions taken in response
to specific offenses as well. For example, 66 percent
of high schools took serious disciplinary actions in
response to distribution, possession, or use of illegal
drugs, compared with 37 percent of middle schools,
23 percent of combined schools, and 2 percent of
primary schools.
A total of 433,800 serious disciplinary actions were
taken by public schools during the 2009–10 school
year for specific offenses. Most of these reported
disciplinary actions were taken in response to physical
attacks or fights (265,100 actions). The number of
disciplinary actions taken in response to the use or
possession of a firearm or explosive device (5,800
actions) was smaller than for other offenses reported.
Of the serious disciplinary actions taken during the
2009–10 school year, 74 percent were suspensions
for 5 days or more, 20 percent were transfers to
specialized schools, and 6 percent were removals
with no services for the remainder of the school year.

Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 8.
Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. High
schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 12.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. Serious disciplinary
actions include removals with no continuing services for at least the remainder of the school year, transfers to specialized schools for disciplinary reasons, and out-of-school suspensions lasting 5 or more days, but less than the remainder of the school year. Respondents were instructed to respond
only for those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified otherwise.

Safety and Security Measures Taken by Schools
During the 2011–12 school year, 88 percent of public schools reported that they controlled access to school
buildings by locking or monitoring doors during school hours, and 64 percent reported that they used security
cameras to monitor the school. In the 2009–10 school year, 43 percent of schools reported the presence of
one or more security staff at their school at least once a week during the school year.
Schools use a variety of practices and procedures
to promote the safety of students and staff. In the
Schools and Staffing Survey, principals of public
and private schools were asked about their schools’
use of safety and security measures and procedures.
Certain practices, such as locking or monitoring
doors or gates, are intended to limit or control access
to school campuses, while others, such as the use of
metal detectors and security cameras, are intended
to monitor or restrict students’ and visitors’ behavior
on campus. Another measure of safety and security,
collected in the School Survey on Crime and Safety,
is the presence of full-time and part-time security staff
in public schools during the school year.
In the 2011–12 school year, 88 percent of public
schools reported that they controlled access to school
buildings by locking or monitoring doors during
school hours (table 20.1). Other safety and security
measures frequently reported by public schools
included the use of security cameras to monitor the
school (64 percent) and the enforcement of a strict
dress code (49 percent; figure 20.1). In addition, 44
percent of public schools reported that they controlled
access to school grounds by locking or monitoring

gates during school hours, 24 percent reported the
use of random dog sniffs to check for drugs, and 19
percent required that students wear uniforms.
In general, higher percentages of public than of
private schools reported the use of various safety and
security measures in the 2011–12 school year (table
20.1). For example, higher percentages of public than
of private schools reported the use of security cameras
(64 vs. 41 percent) and random dog sniffs to check for
drugs (24 vs. 4 percent). Higher percentages of public
than of private schools also reported the following
measures: controlling access to school buildings
during school hours; requiring that students wear
badges or picture IDs; requiring that book bags be
clear or banning them from school; conducting metal
detector checks on students (including both random
and daily checks); and conducting random sweeps
for contraband.45 However, higher percentages of
private than of public schools enforced a strict dress
code (71 vs. 49 percent) and required that students
wear uniforms (57 vs. 19 percent).

In the 2011–12 school year, higher percentages of
public secondary schools or combined schools than
of elementary schools reported using the following
safety and security measures: enforcing a strict dress
code; requiring that students wear badges or picture
IDs; requiring that book bags be clear or banning
them from school; conducting metal detector checks
on students (including both random and daily
checks); using random dog sniffs to check for drugs;
conducting random sweeps for contraband;46 and
using security cameras to monitor the school (table
20.2). For example, among public schools, 81 percent
of secondary schools, 72 percent of combined schools,
and 58 percent of elementary schools reported the
use of security cameras to monitor the school (table
20.1). In addition, the percentage of public secondary
schools who reported using random dog sniffs for
drugs (57 percent) was higher than the percentages of
combined schools (41 percent) and elementary schools
(11 percent) with such a procedure in place. However,
lower percentages of public secondary schools (84
percent) and combined schools (83 percent) than of
elementary schools (90 percent) reported controlling
access to buildings during school hours. Also, the
percentage of public secondary schools who reported
requiring that students wear uniforms (12 percent)
was lower than the percentages of elementary schools
(20 percent) and combined schools (30 percent) with
such a requirement.
The use of safety and security measures in the
2011–12 school year also varied by public school
locale (table 20.2). Higher percentages of public city
schools than of public schools in suburban, town,
and rural areas reported the following measures:
controlling access to school grounds during school
hours; requiring that students wear uniforms;
enforcing a strict dress code; requiring that students

For example, drugs or weapons. Does not include dog sniffs.

Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures

wear badges or picture IDs; and conducting metal
detector checks on students (including both random
and daily checks). For example, 55 percent of public
city schools reported controlling access to school
grounds, compared with 46 percent of suburban
schools and 37 percent each of public schools in towns
and rural areas. However, public city schools had the
lowest reported percentage of schools with security
cameras (59 percent of city schools vs. between 65 and
67 percent of rural, suburban, and town schools). In
addition, higher percentages of public town and rural
schools than of city and suburban schools reported
the use of random dog sniffs for drugs and random
sweeps for contraband.
Many safety and security measures tended to be more
prevalent in high-poverty public schools (where 76
percent or more of students are eligible for free or
reduced-price lunch) than in low-poverty schools
(where 25 percent or less of students are eligible for
free or reduced-price lunch) during the 2011–12
school year (table 20.2). Higher percentages of highpoverty public schools than of low-poverty schools
reported controlling access to school grounds during
school hours; requiring that students wear uniforms;
enforcing a strict dress code; requiring that students
wear badges or picture IDs; requiring that book bags
be clear or banning them from school; conducting
metal detector checks on students (including both
random and daily checks); and conducting sweeps
for contraband.46 For instance, 64 percent of
high-poverty public schools reported enforcing a
strict dress code, compared with 38 percent of lowpoverty schools. Also, 47 percent of high-poverty
public schools reported requiring school uniforms,
compared to 6 percent of low-poverty public schools.

The percentages of public schools reporting the use
of various safety and security measures in 2011–12
tended to be higher or not measurably different from
the percentages reported in 2003–04 (figure 20.2 and
table 20.1). For example, the percentage of public
schools reporting that they required that students
wear uniforms increased from 13 to 19  percent
between the 2003–04 and 2011–12 school years.
Public schools’ reported use of security cameras
to monitor the school increased from 2003–04
(32  percent) to 2011–12 (64 percent). Also, the
percentage of public schools reporting that they
controlled access to buildings during school hours
was higher in 2011–12 than in 2003–04 (88 vs. 82
percent). A similar pattern was observed for controlled
access to grounds during school hours (44 percent in
2011–12 vs. 39 percent in 2003–04).
In the 2009–10 school year, 43 percent of public
schools reported the presence of one or more security
guards, security personnel, School Resource Officers,
or sworn law enforcement officers at their school
at least once a week during the school year (table
20.3).47 The percentage of public schools reporting
the presence of security staff did not measurably
differ between 2005–06 (42 percent) and 2009–10
(43 percent); however, the percentage of public schools
reporting the presence of security staff was higher
in 2007–08 (46 percent) than in either 2005–06
or 2009–10. Twenty-nine percent of public schools
reported having at least one full-time employed
security staff who was present at least once a week,
and 14 percent of public schools reported having only
part-time staff. A lower percentage of public schools
reported full-time security staff at their school in
2005–06 (27 percent) than in 2007–08 (30 percent),
while there were no measurable differences between
each of these percentages and the percentage reported
in 2009–10 (29 percent). No measurable differences
were found across years for the percentages of public
schools reporting part-time only security staff.

About 28 percent of public primary schools
reported the presence of one or more security staff
at their school at least once a week in 2009–10.
The percentage of public primary schools reporting
security staff was lower than the percentages of middle
schools and high schools reporting the presence of
security staff (66 and 76 percent, respectively) but
was not measurably different from the percentage of
combined schools reporting the presence of security
staff. A higher percentage of public high schools
(62 percent) than of primary (16 percent), combined
(24 percent), or middle schools (46 percent) reported
having full-time security staff (table 20.3).
Differences in the presence of security staff were also
found by other school characteristics. For example,
the percentage of public city schools that reported the
presence of one or more security staff at least once
a week during the 2009–10 school year (51 percent)
was higher than the percentages of town schools
(39 percent) and rural schools (35 percent). The
percentage of public suburban schools reporting the
presence of security staff (45 percent) was also higher
than the percentage of rural schools.
Public schools were also asked to report whether
any of their security staff routinely carried a firearm
at school.48 In 2009–10, some 28 percent of all
public schools reported the presence of security
staff routinely carrying a firearm (table 20.3). The
percentage of public schools reporting security staff
routinely carrying firearms was higher in 2007–08
(34 percent) than in either 2005–06 (31 percent)
or 2009–10 (28 percent); there was no measurable
difference between 2005–06 and 2009–10. Twelve
percent of public primary schools, 25 percent of
combined schools, 51 percent of middle schools, and
63 percent of high schools reported the presence of
one or more security staff at their schools routinely
carrying firearms during the 2009–10 school year.

Indicator 21
Students’ Reports of Safety and Security Measures Observed
at School
In 2013, about 77 percent of students ages 12–18 reported observing one or more security cameras to
monitor the school during the day at their schools, and 76 percent of students reported observing locked
entrance or exit doors during the day.
In the School Crime Supplement to the National
Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18
were asked whether their schools used certain
security measures.49 Security measures include metal
detectors, locker checks, security cameras, security
guards or assigned police officers, adults supervising
hallways, badges or picture identification for students,
a written code of student conduct, locked entrance
or exit doors during the day, and a requirement that
visitors sign in. In 2013, nearly all students ages 12–18
reported that they observed the use of at least one of
the selected security measures at their schools (figure
21.1 and table 21.1).
In 2013, most students ages 12–18 reported that their
schools had a written code of student conduct and a
requirement that visitors sign in (96 percent each).
Approximately 90 percent of students reported the
presence of school staff (other than security guards
or assigned police officers) or other adults supervising
the hallway, 77 percent reported the use of one or
more security cameras at their schools, and 76 percent
reported locked entrance or exit doors during the day.
About 70 percent of students reported the presence
of security guards and/or assigned police officers,
52 percent reported locker checks, and 26 percent
reported that students were required to wear badges or
picture identification at their schools. Eleven percent
of students reported the use of metal detectors at their
schools, representing the least observed of the selected
safety and security measures.
The percentage of students who reported locked
entrance or exit doors during the day increased

between the two most recent survey years, as well
as over the past 14 years. Specifically, 76 percent of
students reported observing locked entrance or exit
doors during the day in 2013, representing an increase
from 65 percent in 2011, as well as an overall increase
from 38 percent in 1999. The percentage of students
who reported the presence of school staff (other than
security guards or assigned police officers) or other
adults supervising the hallway also was higher in
2013 (90 percent) than in 2011 (89 percent) and in
1999 (85 percent).
The percentage of students who reported the presence
of metal detectors at school increased from 1999 to
2013 (from 9 to 11 percent), as did the percentage
of students who reported the presence of security
guards and/or assigned police officers (from 54 to
70  percent) and the percentage of students who
reported a requirement that visitors sign in (from 87 to
96 percent). Beginning in 2001, students were asked
whether they observed the use of security cameras
at school and whether they were required to wear
badges or picture identification. From 2001 to 2013,
the percentage of students who reported the use of
one or more security cameras at school increased from
39 to 77 percent, and the percentage of students who
reported that they were required to wear badges or
picture identification increased from 21 to 26 percent.
No measurable differences were found between the
two most recent survey years (2011 and 2013) in the
percentages of students reporting these safety and
security measures.

Readers should note that this indicator relies on student
reports of security measures and provides estimates based on
students’ awareness of the measure rather than on documented
practice. See Indicator 20 for a summary of the use of various
security measures as reported by schools.

This indicator has been updated to include 2013 data. For more information: Table 21.1, and DeVoe and Bauer (2011), (http://

Indicator 22
Criminal Incidents at Postsecondary Institutions
In 2012, there were 29,500 criminal incidents on campus at public and private 2-year and 4-year
postsecondary institutions that were reported to police and security agencies, representing a 4 percent decrease
from 2011 (30,700). There was also a decrease in the number of on-campus crimes reported per 10,000
full-time-equivalent students, from 20.0 in 2011 to 19.4 in 2012.
Since 1990, postsecondary institutions participating
in Title IV federal student financial aid programs have
been required to comply with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure
of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics
Act, known as the Clery Act. The Clery Act requires
institutions to give timely warnings about crimes to
students and staff; to publicly report campus crime and
safety policies; and to collect, report, and disseminate
campus crime data. Since 1999, data on campus
safety and security have been reported by institutions
through the Campus Safety and Security Survey.
These reports include on-campus criminal offenses and
arrests involving students, faculty, staff, and the general
public. Reports on referrals for disciplinary action
primarily deal with persons associated formally with
the institution (i.e., students, faculty, and other staff).
In 2012, there were 29,500 criminal incidents against
persons and property on campus at public and private
2-year and 4-year postsecondary institutions that were
reported to police and security agencies, representing a
4 percent decrease from 2011 (30,700; table 22.1). There
was also a decrease in the number of on-campus crimes
per 10,000 full-time-equivalent (FTE) students, from
20.0 in 2011 to 19.4 in 2012 (table 22.2).
Among the various types of on-campus crimes reported
in 2012, there were 18,100 burglaries, constituting
61  percent of all criminal incidents (table 22.1 and
figure 22.1). Other commonly reported crimes included
forcible sex offenses (3,900 incidents, or 13 percent of
crimes) and motor vehicle theft (3,000 incidents, or 10
percent of crimes). In addition, 2,400 aggravated assaults
and 1,400 robberies were reported. These estimates
translate to 11.9 burglaries, 2.6 forcible sex offenses,
2.0 motor vehicle thefts, 1.6 aggravated assaults, and
0.9  robberies per 10,000 FTE students (table 22.2).
Eleven murders occurred on college campuses in 2012,
fewer than the 16 that occurred in 2011.

Looking at on-campus crime patterns over a longer
period, the overall number of crimes reported between
2001 and 2012 decreased by 29 percent (table 22.1).
Although the number of reported on-campus crimes
increased by 7 percent between 2001 and 2006 (from
41,600 to 44,500), the number of crimes decreased by
34 percent (to 29,500) between 2006 and 2012. The
number of on-campus crimes reported in 2012 was
lower than in 2001 for every category except forcible
sex offenses. The number of reported forcible sex crimes
on campus increased from 2,200 in 2001 to 3,900 in
2012 (a 77 percent increase). More recently, the number
of reported forcible sex crimes increased from 3,400 in
2011 to 3,900 in 2012 (a 15 percent increase).
Increases in FTE college enrollment between 2001
and 2012 as well as changes in the number of crimes
affected the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000
FTE students (see Digest of Education Statistics 2014
for details about college enrollment). Overall, the
number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 students was
lower in 2012 (19.4 per 10,000) than in 2001 (35.6
per 10,000; table 22.2). Between 2001 and 2006,
enrollment increased by a larger percentage than the
number of crimes, which resulted in the number of
on-campus crimes per 10,000 students in 2006 (33.3)
actually being lower than in 2001 (35.6). Between 2006
and 2012, the number of reported on-campus crimes
decreased, enrollment increased, and the number of
on-campus crimes per 10,000 students decreased from
33.3 to 19.4. The rates per 10,000 students for all types
of reported on-campus crimes other than forcible sex
offenses were lower in 2012 than in 2001. In the case of
forcible sex offenses, the rate was higher in 2012 (2.6 per
10,000 students) than in 2001 (1.9 per 10,000 students).

In 2012, the number of crimes committed on college
campuses differed by type of institution, though
to some extent this reflects the enrollment size of
the sectors and the presence of student residence
halls. For example, more crimes were committed at
institutions with residence halls than at institutions
without residence halls (table 22.2). Crimes
involving students on campus after normal class
hours, such as those occurring in residence halls,
are included in campus crime reports, while crimes
involving students off campus are not. At public
4-year institutions in 2012, some 50 percent of the
14,200 on-campus crimes occurred in residence
halls; at nonprofit 4-year institutions, 61 percent of
the 10,700 on-campus crimes occurred in residence
halls (table 22.1). Burglaries constituted the majority
of the reported crimes at both types of institutions.
Although data for different types of institutions
are difficult to compare directly because of
the differing structures of student services and
campus arrangements, there were decreases in the
numbers of on-campus crimes at most types of
institutions between 2006 and 2012. At public
4-year institutions, the number of on-campus crimes
decreased from a high of 20,600 in 2006 to 14,200
in 2012. Also, the number of on-campus crimes per
10,000 students decreased from 35.5 to 21.1 during
this period (table 22.2). Similarly, at nonprofit
4-year institutions, the number of crimes decreased
from 16,900 in 2006 to 10,700 in 2012, and the
number of crimes per 10,000 students decreased
from 57.7 to 32.5. At public 2-year institutions,
which generally do not have residence halls, the
number of crimes decreased from 5,700 to 3,800
between 2006 and 2012, and the number of crimes
per 10,000 students decreased from 15.4 to 9.4.
As part of the Clery Act, institutions are required
to report the number of arrests made for illegal
weapons possession and drug and liquor law
violations on college campuses. In contrast to the
decreases in reported on-campus crimes, the total
number of arrests for illegal weapons possession
and drug and liquor law violations increased
from 40,300 in 2001 to 51,400 in 2012, although

98

Postsecondary Campus Safety and Security

the 2012 figure was down from 54,400 in 2011
(table 22.1 and figure 22.2). While the number of
arrests for weapons possession was 4 percent lower
in 2012 than in 2001 (1,000 vs. 1,100), there were
increases over the period in the larger categories of
arrests for drug and liquor law violations. Arrests for
drug law violations increased by 76 percent during
this period, reaching 20,800, and arrests for liquor
law violations rose by 8 percent, reaching 29,500.
Some of the increases in arrests may be associated
with increases in student enrollment during this
period. The number of arrests for drug law violations
per 10,000 students increased from 10.2 to 13.7
(table 22.2); however, the number of arrests per
10,000 students for liquor law violations was lower
in 2012 (19.4) than in 2001 (23.5).
There were some differences among institution
types in the patterns of on-campus arrests made for
illegal weapons possession and drug and liquor law
violations. At public 4-year institutions, the number
of on-campus arrests per 10,000 students was higher
in 2012 than in 2001 (62.5 vs. 60.1). In contrast,
there was a decrease in the number of on-campus
arrests per 10,000 students at nonprofit 4-year
institutions (from 24.5 to 16.8). The number of oncampus arrests per 10,000 students at public 2-year
institutions in 2012 was 8.7, which was higher than
in 2001 (7.8) but lower than in 2006 (10.9).
In addition to reporting on-campus arrests,
institutions report referrals for disciplinary action
for cases involving illegal weapons possession,
drug law violations, and liquor law violations.
Disciplinary action counts only include incidents
for which there was a referral for institutional
disciplinary action, but no arrest. In 2012, there
were 248,900 referrals for disciplinary action for
cases involving weapons, drugs, and liquor law
violations, with most of the referrals (90 percent)
involving violations in residence halls. The largest
number of disciplinary referrals (193,500) involved
liquor law violations (table 22.1).

Similar to the number of on-campus arrests for drug
and liquor law violations, the number of disciplinary
referrals for these incidents has increased. The number
of referrals for drug law violations rose by 126 percent,
from 23,900 in 2001 to 54,000 in 2012 (figure 22.3).
The number of referrals for liquor law violations rose
by 49 percent, from 130,000 to 193,500. The number
of referrals for illegal weapons possession was lower
in 2012 (1,400) than in 2006 (1,900), but it was
slightly higher than the number of such referrals
in 2001 (1,300). Some of these increases may be
associated with there being more students on college
campuses; however, there were also increases in the
number of disciplinary actions per 10,000 students,
as the number of disciplinary actions rose faster than
enrollment. The number of referrals for drug law
violations increased from 20.5 per 10,000 students in
2001 to 35.6 per 10,000 students in 2012 (table 22.2).
Also, the number of referrals for liquor law violations

100

Postsecondary Campus Safety and Security

per 10,000 students was higher in 2012 (127.4) than
in 2001 (111.3). In contrast, the number of referrals
per 10,000 students for illegal weapons possession was
lower in 2012 (0.9) than in 2001 (1.1).
Both public 4-year and nonprofit 4-year institutions
had increases in disciplinary referrals between 2001
and 2012. At public 4-year institutions, the number
of referrals for disciplinary action involving illegal
weapons, drug law violations, and liquor law violations
increased from 153.1 per 10,000 students in 2001 to
192.2 in 2012. At nonprofit 4-year institutions, the
number of referrals for these types of incidents rose
from 275.5 per 10,000 students to 334.3 per 10,000
students. In both 2001 and 2011, more than threequarters of these referrals for disciplinary action at
public 4-year and nonprofit 4-year institutions were
for liquor law violations.

Indicator 23
Hate Crime Incidents at Postsecondary Institutions
In 2012, out of the 791 total hate crimes reported on college campuses, the most common type of hate crime
reported by institutions was destruction, damage, and vandalism (412 incidents), followed by intimidation
(261 incidents), and simple assault (79 incidents). Race-related and sexual orientation-related hate crimes
accounted for most of the motivating types of bias.
A 2008 amendment to the Jeanne Clery Disclosure
of Campus Security and Campus Crime Statistics Act
(see Criminal Incidents at Postsecondary Institutions;
Indicator 22) requires campuses to report hate crime
incidents. A hate crime is a criminal offense that is
motivated, in whole or in part, by the perpetrator’s
bias against the victim(s) based on their race,
ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or
disability. In addition to reporting data on haterelated incidents for the existing 7 types of crimes, the
2008 amendments to the Clery Act required campuses
to report hate-related incidents on four additional
types of crimes: simple assault; larceny; intimidation;
and destruction, damage, and vandalism.
In 2012, there were 791 criminal incidents classified
as hate crimes that occurred on the campuses of
public and private 2-year and 4-year postsecondary
institutions which were reported to police and
security agencies (table 23.1). The most common type
of hate crime reported by institutions was destruction,
damage, and vandalism (412 incidents), followed
by intimidation (261 incidents), simple assault
(79  incidents), aggravated assault (14 incidents),
larceny (11 incidents), robbery (5 incidents), burglary
(5 incidents), and forcible sex offenses (4 incidents).
For several other types of on-campus crimes—
namely, murder, negligent manslaughter, non-forcible
sex offenses, motor vehicle theft, and arson—there
were no incidents classified as hate crimes.
The distribution of on-campus crimes classified as
hate crimes in 2012 was similar to the distributions
in previous years. In 2011, there were 763 criminal
incidents on campus that were classified as hate

crimes. Further, the three most common types of
hate crimes in 2011 were vandalism (366 incidents),
intimidation (282 incidents), and simple assault
(67  incidents). These were also the three most
common types of hate crimes reported in 2009 and
2010. There were no reported incidents of murder,
negligent manslaughter, non-forcible sex offenses, or
motor vehicle theft classified as hate crimes in 2009,
2010, or 2011.
For the three most common types of hate crimes
reported in 2012 (vandalism, intimidation, and
simple assault), the most frequent category of bias
associated with these crimes was race. Race-related
hate crimes accounted for 46 percent of reported
vandalisms classified as hate crimes, 45 percent of
reported intimidations, and 44 percent of reported
simple assaults. The second most frequent category
of bias associated with all three types of crimes was
sexual orientation. One-quarter of vandalism and
intimidation hate crimes and 28 percent of simple
assaults were classified with sexual orientation as the
motivating bias. Among the other categories of bias,
18 percent of vandalism hate crimes were classified
as associated with religion, 8 percent with ethnicity,
and 3 percent with gender. No vandalism hate crimes
were associated with disability. For intimidation hate
crimes, 11 percent were classified as associated with
religion, 9 percent with ethnicity, 8 percent with
gender, and 2 percent with disability. Simple assault
had a similar distribution across the remaining
categories of bias: 11 percent were associated with
religion, 6 percent with ethnicity, 6 percent with
gender, and 4 percent with disability.

Similar frequencies of bias were associated with
vandalism, intimidation, and simple assault in
2011. Race was the category of bias most frequently
associated with the three most common hate crimes:
46 percent of vandalisms, 39 percent of intimidations,
and 33 percent of simple assaults. Also similar to 2012,
sexual orientation was the second most frequently
reported category of bias for these three types of hate
crimes in 2011: 28 percent of vandalisms, 32 percent
of intimidations, and 24 percent of simple assaults.
Aggravated assault was the fourth most commonly
reported hate crime in both 2011 and 2012. In 2012,
out of the 14 total aggravated assaults reported,
most crimes were associated with race (6 incidents;

104

Postsecondary Campus Safety and Security

43  percent), followed by sexual orientation
(5  incidents; 36 percent) and religion, gender, and
disability (1 incident each; 7 percent each).
While the number of hate crimes reported in 2012
was highest at 4-year public and 4-year private
nonprofit postsecondary institutions (334 and 300
total incidents, respectively), these institutions also
enroll the largest numbers of students. Public 2-year
institutions, which also enroll a large number of
students, had the third highest number of reported hate
crimes (137 incidents). The frequency of crimes and
the most commonly reported categories of bias were
similar across all types of postsecondary institutions.

1A school-associated violent death is defined as “a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention
(involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a
functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States,” while the victim was on
the way to or from regular sessions at school, or while the victim was attending or traveling
to or from an official school-sponsored event.
2“At school” includes on school property, on the way to or from regular sessions at school,
and while attending or traveling to or from a school-sponsored event.
3Total youth suicides are reported for calendar years 1992 through 2011 (instead of school
years 1992–93 through 2011–12).
4Data from 1999–2000 onward are subject to change until interviews with school and law
enforcement officials have been completed. The details learned during the interviews can
occasionally change the classification of a case.

Serious violent1

NOTE: “Serious violent victimization” includes the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. “All violent victimization” includes serious violent crimes as well as simple assault. “Theft” includes attempted and completed purse-snatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery,
which involves the threat or use of force and is classified as a violent crime. “Total victimization” includes theft and violent crimes. Data
in this table are from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and are reported in accordance with Bureau of Justice Statistics
standards. Due to differences in time coverage and administration between the NCVS and the School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the
NCVS, data in this table cannot be compared with data in tables that are based on the SCS. Detail may not sum to totals because of
rounding and missing data on student characteristics. The population size for students ages 12–18 was 25,856,300 in 2013.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30
and 50 percent.
‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the
coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indians/
Alaska Natives, Asians (prior to 2005), Pacific Islanders, and, from 2003 onward, persons of
Two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity
across years should be made with caution.
2Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an
MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”

3Serious violent victimization is also included in violent victimization.
NOTE: “Total victimization” includes theft and violent victimization. A single student could
report more than one type of victimization. In the total victimization section, students who
reported both theft and violent victimization are counted only once. “Theft” includes
attempted and completed purse-snatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and
completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery,
which involves the threat or use of force and is classified as a violent crime. “Serious violent
victimization” includes the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.
“Violent victimization” includes the serious violent crimes as well as simple assault. “At
school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001
onward, going to and from school.

1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students could not be classified
as Two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing data on race
from 1993, 1995, and 1997 with data from later years.
NOTE: Survey respondents were asked about being threatened or injured “with a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club on school
property.” “On school property” was not defined for respondents. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

1Data for the U.S. total include both public and private schools and were collected through a
national survey representing the entire country.
2Data include both public and private schools.
NOTE: Survey respondents were asked about being threatened or injured “with a weapon
such as a gun, knife, or club on school property.” “On school property” was not defined for
respondents. State-level data include public schools only, with the exception of data for Ohio
and South Dakota. Data for the U.S. total, Ohio, and South Dakota include both public and

private schools. For specific states, a given year’s data may be unavailable (1) because the
state did not participate in the survey that year; (2) because the state omitted this particular
survey item from the state-level questionnaire; or (3) because the state had an overall
response rate of less than 60 percent (the overall response rate is the school response rate
multiplied by the student response rate).

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent.
1Teachers were classified as elementary or secondary on the basis of the grades they taught, rather than on the level of the
school in which they taught. In general, elementary teachers include those teaching prekindergarten through grade 5 and those
teaching multiple grades, with a preponderance of grades taught being kindergarten through grade 6. In general, secondary
teachers include those teaching any of grades 7 through 12 and those teaching multiple grades, with a preponderance of grades
taught being grades 7 through 12 and usually with no grade taught being lower than grade 5.
2Includes American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asians, and Pacific Islanders; for 2003–04 and later years, also includes persons of
two or more races.
3Includes traditional public and public charter schools.

survey items “Distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs” and “Distribution, possession, or use of alcohol” appear only on the
questionnaires for 2005–06 and later years.
2009–10 questionnaire was the first to include the survey item “Inappropriate distribution, possession, or use of prescription drugs.”
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At
school” was defined to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold
school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, and after normal
school hours or when school activities or events were in session. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and because schools
that recorded or reported more than one type of crime incident were counted only once in the total percentage of schools recording or
reporting incidents.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent.
1Theft/larceny (taking things worth over $10 without personal confrontation) was defined for respondents as “the unlawful taking of another
person’s property without personal confrontation, threat, violence, or bodily harm.” This includes pocket picking, stealing a purse or backpack (if left unattended or no force was used to take it from owner), theft from a building, theft from a motor vehicle or motor vehicle parts
or accessories, theft of a bicycle, theft from a vending machine, and all other types of thefts.
2Caution should be used when making direct comparisons of “Other incidents” between years because the survey questions about alcohol and drugs changed, as outlined in footnotes 3, 4, and 5.
3The survey items “Distribution of illegal drugs” and “Possession or use of alcohol or illegal drugs” appear only on the 1999–2000 and
2003–04 questionnaires. Different alcohol- and drug-related survey items were used on the questionnaires for later years.

schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher
than grade 8. Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not
higher than grade 9. High schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest grade
is not higher than grade 12. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades, including K–12 schools.
6Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of full-timeequivalent (FTE) teachers. Information regarding the total number of FTE teachers was obtained from the Common Core of Data
(CCD), the sampling frame for SSOCS.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school.
“At school” was defined to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that
hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after
normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

not higher than grade 9. High schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest
grade is not higher than grade 12. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades, including K–12 schools.
6Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of fulltime-equivalent (FTE) teachers. Information regarding the total number of FTE teachers was obtained from the Common Core of
Data (CCD), the sampling frame for SSOCS.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school.
“At school” was defined to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places
that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or
after normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

in 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period was the previous
6 months. Cognitive testing showed that estimates from 2007 onward are comparable to previous years.
NOTE: Urbanicity refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in
2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).” All gangs, whether or not they are involved in violent or illegal activity, are included. “At school”
includes in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and going to and from school.

1Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.
2Before 1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students were not given the option of
choosing two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing data on race
from 1993, 1995, and 1997 with data from later years.

1Data for the U.S. total include both public and private schools and were collected through a
national survey representing the entire country.
2Data include both public and private schools.
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. State-level data include
public schools only, with the exception of data for Ohio and South Dakota. Data for the U.S.

given year’s data may be unavailable (1) because the state did not participate in the survey
that year; (2) because the state omitted this particular survey item from the state-level questionnaire; or (3) because the state had an overall response rate of less than 60 percent (the
overall response rate is the school response rate multiplied by the student response rate).

1Starting in 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period was the previous 6
months. Cognitive testing showed that estimates from 2007 onward are comparable to previous years.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asians (prior to 2005),
Pacific Islanders, and, from 2003 onward, persons of Two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of
race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.

1Students who indicated that they had been called a hate-related word were asked to

were allowed to choose more than one characteristic. If a student chose more than one

NOTE: “At school” includes in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or
going to and from school. “Hate-related” refers to derogatory terms used by others in reference to students’ personal characteristics. Detail may not sum to totals because of
rounding and because students may have reported being targets of hate-related words
related to more than one student characteristic.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30
and 50 percent.
‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the
coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indians/
Alaska Natives, Pacific Islanders, and persons of Two or more races.
2Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an
MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).” These data
by metropolitan status were based on the location of households and differ from those published in Student Reports of Bullying and Cyber-Bullying: Results from the 2011 School

Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, which were based on the
urban-centric measure of the location of the school that the child attended.
3Control of school as reported by the respondent. These data differ from those based on a
matching of the respondent-reported school name to the Common Core of Data’s Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey or the Private School Survey, as reported in
Student Reports of Bullying and Cyber-Bullying: Results from the 2011 School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey.
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going
to and from school. Bullying types do not sum to totals because students could have experienced more than one type of bullying.

1Bullying was defined for respondents as “when one or more students tease, threaten, spread
rumors about, hit, shove, or hurt another student over and over again.” “On school property”
was not defined for survey respondents.
2Survey respondents were asked about being electronically bullied (“being bullied through email, chat rooms, instant messaging, websites, or texting”). Data on electronic bullying were
not collected in 2009.
3Data for the U.S. total include both public and private schools and were collected through a
national survey representing the entire country.
4Data include both public and private schools.

NOTE: State-level data include public schools only, with the exception of data for Ohio and
South Dakota. Data for the U.S. total, Ohio, and South Dakota include both public and private
schools. For specific states, a given year’s data may be unavailable (1) because the state did
not participate in the survey that year; (2) because the state omitted this particular survey
item from the state-level questionnaire; or (3) because the state had an overall response rate
of less than 60 percent (the overall response rate is the school response rate multiplied by the
student response rate).

1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students could not be classified as
Two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing data on race from 1993,
1995, and 1997 with data from later years.
4Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
5In the question asking students about physical fights at school, “on school property” was not defined for survey respondents.

1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many times in the past 12 months they had been in a physical fight.
2In the question asking students about physical fights at school, “on school property” was not
defined for survey respondents.
3Data for the U.S. total include both public and private schools and were collected through a
national survey representing the entire country.
4Data include both public and private schools.

NOTE: State-level data include public schools only, with the exception of data for Ohio and South
Dakota. Data for the U.S. total, Ohio, and South Dakota include both public and private schools.
For specific states, a given year’s data may be unavailable (1) because the state did not participate in the survey that year; (2) because the state omitted this particular survey item from the
state-level questionnaire; or (3) because the state had an overall response rate of less than 60
percent (the overall response rate is the school response rate multiplied by the student response
rate).

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent.
1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many
days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.
3Before 1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students could not be classified as
Two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing data on race from 1993,
1995, and 1997 with data from later years.

4Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
5In the question asking students about carrying a weapon at school, “on school property” was not defined for survey respondents.
NOTE: Respondents were asked about carrying “a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club.”

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30
and 50 percent.
‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the
coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire;
students were simply asked how many days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days.

2In the question asking students about carrying a weapon at school, “on school property” was
not defined for survey respondents.
3Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.
NOTE: Respondents were asked about carrying “a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club.”
Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire;
students were simply asked how many days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days.
2In the question asking students about carrying a weapon at school, “on school property” was
not defined for survey respondents.
3Data for the U.S. total include both public and private schools and were collected through a
national survey representing the entire country.
4Data include both public and private schools.
NOTE: Respondents were asked about carrying “a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club.”
State-level data include public schools only, with the exception of data for Ohio and South

Dakota. Data for the U.S. total, Ohio, and South Dakota include both public and private
schools. For specific states, a given year’s data may be unavailable (1) because the state did
not participate in the survey that year; (2) because the state omitted this particular survey
item from the state-level questionnaire; or (3) because the state had an overall response rate
of less than 60 percent (the overall response rate is the school response rate multiplied by the
student response rate).

1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how
many days during the previous 30 days they had at least one drink of alcohol.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.
3Before 1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students could not be classified
as Two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing data on race
from 1993, 1995, and 1997 with data from later years.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30
and 50 percent.
‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the
coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire;
students were simply asked how many days during the previous 30 days they had at least
one drink of alcohol.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between
30 and 50 percent.
1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many days during the previous 30 days they had
at least one drink of alcohol.
2In the question about drinking alcohol at school, “on school property” was not defined for
survey respondents. Data on alcohol use at school were not collected in 2013.
3Data for the U.S. total include both public and private schools and were collected
through a national survey representing the entire country.

4Data include both public and private schools.
NOTE: State-level data include public schools only, with the exception of data for Ohio
and South Dakota. Data for the U.S. total, Ohio, and South Dakota include both public
and private schools. For specific states, a given year’s data may be unavailable (1)
because the state did not participate in the survey that year; (2) because the state omitted this particular survey item from the state-level questionnaire; or (3) because the state
had an overall response rate of less than 60 percent (the overall response rate is the
school response rate multiplied by the student response rate).

1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students could not be classified as
Two or more races. Because the response categories changed in 1999, caution should be used in comparing data on race from 1993,
1995, and 1997 with data from later years.
4Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
5In the question about using marijuana at school, “on school property” was not defined for survey respondents. Data on marijuana use
at school were not collected in 2013.

‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many times during the previous 30 days they had used marijuana.

2In the question about using marijuana at school, “on school property” was not defined for survey
respondents.
3Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.
4Data on marijuana use at school were not collected in 2013.
NOTE: Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between
30 and 50 percent.
1The term “anywhere” is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many times during the previous 30 days they had
used marijuana.
2In the question about using marijuana at school, “on school property” was not defined for
survey respondents. Data on marijuana use at school were not collected in 2013.
3Data for the U.S. total include both public and private schools and were collected
through a national survey representing the entire country.

4Data include both public and private schools.
NOTE: State-level data include public schools only, with the exception of data for Ohio
and South Dakota. Data for the U.S. total, Ohio, and South Dakota include both public
and private schools. For specific states, a given year’s data may be unavailable (1)
because the state did not participate in the survey that year; (2) because the state omitted this particular survey item from the state-level questionnaire; or (3) because the state
had an overall response rate of less than 60 percent (the overall response rate is the
school response rate multiplied by the student response rate).

!Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is between 30
and 50 percent.
‡Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the
coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater.
1Starting in 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the
reference period was the previous 6 months. Cognitive testing showed that estimates from
2007 onward are comparable to previous years.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indians/
Alaska Natives, Asians (prior to 2005), Pacific Islanders, and, from 2003 onward, persons of
Two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity
across years should be made with caution.

3Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an
MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and,
from 2001 onward, going to and from school. Students were asked if they “never,” “almost
never,” “sometimes,” or “most of the time” feared that someone would attack or harm them at
school or away from school. Students responding “sometimes” or “most of the time” were
considered fearful. For the 2001 survey only, the wording was changed from “attack or harm”
to “attack or threaten to attack.”

1Starting in 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the
reference period was the previous 6 months. Cognitive testing showed that estimates from
2007 onward are comparable to previous years.
2Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indians/
Alaska Natives, Asians (prior to 2005), Pacific Islanders, and, from 2003 onward, persons of
Two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity
across years should be made with caution.

3Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an
MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
4Before 2007, students were asked whether they avoided “any extracurricular activities.”
Starting in 2007, the survey wording was changed to “any activities.”
NOTE: Students were asked whether they avoided places or activities because they thought
that someone might attack or harm them. For the 2001 survey only, the wording was changed
from “attack or harm” to “attack or threaten to attack.” Detail may not sum to totals because of
rounding and because students reporting more than one type of avoidance were counted
only once in the totals.

the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. High schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower
than grade 9 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 12. Combined schools include all other combinations of
grades, including K–12 schools.
NOTE: Serious disciplinary actions include out-of-school suspensions lasting 5 or more days, but less than the remainder of the school year; removals with no continuing services for at least the remainder of the school year; and transfers
to specialized schools for disciplinary reasons. Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. Respondents were instructed to respond only for those times that
were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified otherwise. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding and because schools that reported serious disciplinary actions in
response to more than one type of offense were counted only once in the total number or percentage of schools.

1 Prior to 2005–06, the questionnaire wording was simply “a weapon other than a firearm” (instead of “a weapon other
than a firearm or explosive device”).
2 In the 1999–2000 questionnaire, only two items are the same as in questionnaires for later years—the item on physical
attacks or fights and the item on insubordination. There are no comparable 1999–2000 data for serious disciplinary
actions taken in response to the other specific offenses listed in this table, nor for total actions taken in response to all
the listed offenses.
3 Totals for 2009–10 are not comparable to totals for other years, because the 2009–10 questionnaire did not include an
item on insubordination.

1Although crimes, arrests, and referrals include incidents involving students, staff, and campus guests, they are expressed as a ratio to FTE students because comprehensive FTE
counts of all these groups are not available.
2Excludes suicides, fetal deaths, traffic fatalities, accidental deaths, and justifiable homicide
(such as the killing of a felon by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty).
3Killing of another person through gross negligence (excludes traffic fatalities).
4Any sexual act directed against another person forcibly and/or against that person’s will.
5Includes only statutory rape or incest.
6Taking or attempting to take anything of value using actual or threatened force or violence.
7Attack upon a person for the purpose of inflicting severe or aggravated bodily injury.
8Unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or theft.

NOTE: Data are for degree-granting institutions, which are institutions that grant associate’s or
higher degrees and participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs. Some institutions that
report Clery data—specifically, non-degree-granting institutions and institutions outside of the
50 states and the District of Columbia—are excluded from this table. Crimes, arrests, and
referrals include incidents involving students, staff, and on-campus guests. Excludes off-campus crimes and arrests even if they involve college students or staff. Detail may not sum to
totals because of rounding. Some data have been revised from previously published figures.

General Information

School-Associated Violent Deaths Study (SAVD)

The indicators in this report are based on information
drawn from a variety of independent data sources,
including national surveys of students, teachers,
principals, and postsecondary institutions, and
data collection from federal departments and
agencies, including the Bureau of Justice Statistics,
the National Center for Education Statistics, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, and the Office of
Postsecondary Education. Each data source has an
independent sample design, data collection method,
and questionnaire design or is the result of a universe
data collection. Universe data collections include a
census of all known entities in a specific universe
(e.g., all deaths occurring on school property). Readers
should be cautious when comparing data from
different sources. Differences in sampling procedures,
populations, time periods, and question phrasing can
all affect the comparability of results. For example,
some questions from different surveys may appear
the same, but were asked of different populations
of students (e.g., students ages 12–18 or students in
grades 9–12); in different years; about experiences
that occurred within different periods of time (e.g.,
in the past 30 days or during the past 12 months);
or at different locations (e.g., in school or anywhere).

The School-Associated Violent Deaths Study (SAVD)
is an epidemiological study developed by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in conjunction
with the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S.
Department of Justice. SAVD seeks to describe the
epidemiology of school-associated violent deaths,
identify common features of these deaths, estimate
the rate of school-associated violent deaths in the
United States, and identify potential risk factors for
these deaths. The study includes descriptive data on all
school-associated violent deaths in the United States,
including all homicides, suicides, or legal intervention
in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of
a functioning elementary or secondary school; while
the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions
at such a school; or while attending or on the way to
or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims of
such incidents include nonstudents, as well as students
and staff members. SAVD includes descriptive
information about the school, event, victim(s), and
offender(s). The SAVD study has collected data from
July 1, 1992, through the present.

All comparisons described in this report are
statistically significant at the .05 level. The primary
test procedure used in this report was Student’s t
statistic, which tests the difference between two
sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted
for multiple comparisons. Estimates displayed in the
text, figures, and tables are rounded from original
estimates, not from a series of rounding.
The following is a description of data sources,
accuracy of estimates, and statistical procedures used
in this report.

Sources of Data
This section briefly describes each of the datasets used
in this report: the School-Associated Violent Deaths

Appendix A: Technical Notes

SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and
collect data on school-associated violent deaths.
Cases are initially identified through a search of the
LexisNexis newspaper and media database. Then
law enforcement officials are contacted to confirm
the details of the case and to determine if the event
meets the case definition. Once a case is confirmed,
a law enforcement official and a school official are
interviewed regarding details about the school,
event, victim(s), and offender(s). A copy of the
full law enforcement report is also sought for each
case. The information obtained on schools includes
school demographics, attendance/absentee rates,
suspensions/expulsions and mobility, school history
of weapon-carrying incidents, security measures,
violence prevention activities, school response to the
event, and school policies about weapon carrying.
Event information includes the location of injury,
the context of injury (while classes were being held,
during break, etc.), motives for injury, method of
injury, and school and community events happening
around the time period. Information obtained on
victim(s) and offender(s) includes demographics,
circumstances of the event (date/time, alcohol or drug
use, number of persons involved), types and origins of
weapons, criminal history, psychological risk factors,
school-related problems, extracurricular activities,
and family history, including structure and stressors.
One hundred and five school-associated violent deaths
were identified from July 1, 1992, to June 30, 1994

(Kachur et al. 1996). A more recent report from
this data collection identified 253 school-associated
violent deaths between July 1, 1994, and June 30,
1999 (Anderson et al. 2001). Other publications from
this study have described how the number of events
change during the school year (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention 2001), the source of the
firearms used in these events (Reza et al. 2003), and
suicides that were associated with schools (Kauffman
et al. 2004). The most recent publication describes
trends in school-associated homicide from July 1,
1992, to June 30, 2006 (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention 2008). The interviews conducted
on cases between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1999,
achieved a response rate of 97 percent for police
officials and 78 percent for school officials. For several
reasons, all data for years from 1999 to the present
are flagged as preliminary. For some recent data, the
interviews with school and law enforcement officials
to verify case details have not been completed. The
details learned during the interviews can occasionally
change the classification of a case. Also, new cases
may be identified because of the expansion of the
scope of the media files used for case identification.
Sometimes other cases not identified during earlier
data years using the independent case finding efforts
(which focus on nonmedia sources of information)
will be discovered. Also, other cases may occasionally
be identified while the law enforcement and school
interviews are being conducted to verify known cases.

nonnegligent manslaughters in the United States from
January 1980 to December 2012; that is, negligent
manslaughters and justifiable homicides have been
eliminated from the data. Based on law enforcement
agency reports, the FBI estimates that 625,919
murders (including nonnegligent manslaughters) were
committed from 1980 to 2011. Agencies provided
detailed information on 590,954 of these homicide
victims. SHR estimates in this report have been
revised from those in previously published reports.

Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR)
Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) are a part
of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). These
reports provide incident-level information on criminal
homicides, including situation type (e.g., number of
victims, number of offenders, and whether offenders
are known); the age, sex, and race of victims and
offenders; weapon used; circumstances of the
incident; and the relationship of the victim to the
offender. The data are provided monthly to the FBI
by local law enforcement agencies participating in
the UCR program. The data include murders and

About 90 percent of homicides are included in the
SHR program. However, adjustments can be made
to the weights to correct for missing victim reports.
Estimates from the SHR program used in this report
were generated by the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS). The SHR data were weighted to compensate
for the average annual 10 percent of homicides that
were not reported to the SHR. The development of
the set of annual weights is a three-step process.
Each year the FBI’s annual Crime in the United States
report presents a national estimate of murder victims
in the United States and estimates of the number
of murder victims in each of the 50 states and the
District of Columbia. The first-stage weight uses the
FBI’s annual estimates of murder victims in each state
and the number of murder victims from that state
found in the annual SHR database.
Specifically, the first-stage weight for victims in state
S in year Y is

For complete reporting states, this first-stage weight
is equal to 1. For partial reporting states, this weight
is greater than 1. For states with a first-stage weight
greater than 2—that is, the state reported SHR data
for less than half of the FBI’s estimated number of
murder victims in the state—the first-stage weight
is set to 1.
The second-stage weight uses the FBI’s annual
national estimates of murder victims in the United
States and the sum of the first-stage weights for each
state. The second-stage weight for victims in all states
in year Y is
FBI estimate of murder victims
in the United States(year Y)
Sum of the first-stage weights of all states(year Y)

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2014

The third step in the process is to calculate the final
annual victim-level SHR weight. The weight used to
develop national estimates of the attributes of murder
victims is
SHR weight(year Y) =
(First-stage weight(year Y))*Second-stage weight(year
)
Y)
Conceptually, the first-stage weight uses a state’s
own reported SHR records to represent all murder
victims in that state, as long as at least 50 percent of
the estimated number of murder victims in that state
have a record in the SHR. The sum of the first-stage
weights then equals the sum of the total number of
all murder victims in states with at least 50 percent
SHR coverage and the simple count of those victims
from the other reporting states. The second-stage
weight is used to inflate the first-stage weights so that
the weight derived from the product of the first- and
second-stage weights represents all murder victims
in that year in the United States. The difference
between the sum of the first-stage weights and the
FBI’s annual national estimate of murder victims
is the unreported murder victims in states with
less than 50 percent SHR coverage and the murder
victims in states that report no data to the SHR in
that year. The second-stage weight compensates for
this difference by assuming that the attributes of the
nonreported victims are similar to the attributes of
weighted murder victims in that year’s SHR database.
The weighting procedure outlined above assumes that
the characteristics of unreported homicide incidents
are similar to the characteristics of reported incidents.
There is no comprehensive way to assess the validity
of this assumption. There is one exception to this
weighting process. Some states did not report any
data in some years. For example, Florida reported
no incidents to the SHR program for the years
1988 through 2012. The annual national weights,
however, attempt to compensate for those few
instances in which entire states did not report any
data. For additional information about the SHR

Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting
System Fatal (WISQARS™ Fatal)
WISQARS Fatal provides mortality data related to
injury. The mortality data reported in WISQARS
Fatal come from death certificate data reported to
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data
include causes of death reported by attending
physicians, medical examiners, and coroners and
demographic information about decedents reported
by funeral directors, who obtain that information
from family members and other informants. NCHS
collects, compiles, verifies, and prepares these data for
release to the public. The data provide information
about unintentional injuries, homicide, and suicide
as leading causes of death, how common they are,
and whom they affect. These data are intended for
a broad audience—the public, the media, public
health practitioners and researchers, and public health
officials—to increase their knowledge of injury.
WISQARS Fatal mortality reports provide tables of
the total numbers of injury-related deaths and the
death rates per 100,000 U.S. population. The reports
list deaths according to cause (mechanism) and intent
(manner) of injury by state, race, Hispanic origin,
sex, and age groupings. For more information on

National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS),
administered for the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS) by the U.S. Census Bureau, is the nation’s
primary source of information on crime and the
victims of crime. Initiated in 1972 and redesigned
in 1992, the NCVS collects detailed information
on the frequency and nature of the crimes of rape,
sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault,
theft, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft
experienced by Americans and American households
each year. The survey measures both crimes reported
to police and crimes not reported to the police.

NCVS estimates reported in Indicators of School
Crime and Safety: 2013 and beyond may differ from
those in previous published reports. This is because a
small number of victimizations, referred to as series
victimizations, are included in this report using
a new counting strategy. High-frequency repeat
victimizations, or series victimizations, are six or
more similar but separate victimizations that occur
with such frequency that the victim is unable to recall
each individual event or describe each event in detail.
As part of ongoing research efforts associated with
the redesign of the NCVS, BJS investigated ways to
include high-frequency repeat victimizations, or series
victimizations, in estimates of criminal victimization.
Including series victimizations results in more accurate
estimates of victimization. BJS has decided to include
series victimizations using the victim’s estimates
of the number of times the victimization occurred
over the past 6 months, capping the number of
victimizations within each series at a maximum of
10. This strategy for counting series victimizations
balances the desire to estimate national rates and
account for the experiences of persons who have been
subjected to repeat victimizations against the desire to
minimize the estimation errors that can occur when
repeat victimizations are reported. Including series
victimizations in national rates results in rather large
increases in the level of violent victimization; however,
trends in violence are generally similar regardless
of whether series victimizations are included. For
more information on the new counting strategy
and supporting research, see Methods for Counting
High Frequency Repeat Victimizations in the National
Crime Victimization Survey at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/

Readers should note that in 2003, in accordance
with changes to the U.S. Office of Management and
Budget’s standards for the classification of federal
data on race and ethnicity, the NCVS item on race/
ethnicity was modified. A question on Hispanic origin
is now followed by a new question about race. The new
question about race allows the respondent to choose
more than one race and delineates Asian as a separate
category from Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific
Islander. An analysis conducted by the Demographic
Surveys Division at the U.S. Census Bureau showed
that the new race question had very little impact on the
aggregate racial distribution of NCVS respondents,
with one exception: There was a 1.6 percentage
point decrease in the percentage of respondents who
reported themselves as White. Due to changes in race/
ethnicity categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity
across years should be made with caution.

There were changes in the sample design and
survey methodology in the 2006 National Crime
Victimization Survey (NCVS) that may have affected
survey estimates. Caution should be used when
comparing 2006 estimates to estimates of other years.
Data from 2007 onward are comparable to earlier
years. Analyses of the 2007 estimates indicate that the
program changes made in 2006 had relatively small
effects on NCVS estimates. For more information on
the 2006 NCVS data, see Criminal Victimization,

The number of NCVS-eligible households in the
sample in 2013 was about 107,400. Households were
selected using a stratified, multistage cluster design.
In the first stage, the primary sampling units (PSUs),
consisting of counties or groups of counties, were
selected. In the second stage, smaller areas, called
Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected from each
sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs, clusters
of four households, called segments, were selected
for interview. At each stage, the selection was done
proportionate to population size in order to create a selfweighting sample. The final sample was augmented to
account for households constructed after the decennial
Census. Within each sampled household, the U.S.
Census Bureau interviewer attempts to interview all
household members age 12 and older to determine
whether they had been victimized by the measured
crimes during the 6 months preceding the interview.
The first NCVS interview with a housing unit is
conducted in person. Subsequent interviews are
conducted by telephone, if possible. About 80,000
persons age 12 and older are interviewed every
6  months. Households remain in the sample for 3
years and are interviewed seven times at 6-month
intervals. Since the survey’s inception, the initial
interview at each sample unit has been used only to
bound future interviews to establish a time frame
to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered in these
subsequent interviews. Beginning in 2006, data from
the initial interview have been adjusted to account
for the effects of bounding and have been included
in the survey estimates. After a household has been
interviewed its seventh time, it is replaced by a new
sample household. In 2013, the household response
rate was about 84 percent, and the completion rate
for persons within households was about 88 percent.
Weights were developed to permit estimates for the

School Crime Supplement (SCS)
Created as a supplement to the NCVS and co-designed
by the National Center for Education Statistics
and Bureau of Justice Statistics, the School Crime
Supplement (SCS) survey has been conducted in 1989,
1995, and biennially since 1999 to collect additional
information about school-related victimizations on
a national level. This report includes data from the
1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, and
2013 collections. The 1989 data are not included in
this report as a result of methodological changes to
the NCVS and SCS. The SCS was designed to assist
policymakers, as well as academic researchers and
practitioners at federal, state, and local levels, to make
informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The
survey asks students a number of key questions about
their experiences with and perceptions of crime and
violence that occurred inside their school, on school
grounds, on the school bus, or on the way to or from
school. Students are asked additional questions about
security measures used by their school, students’
participation in after-school activities, students’
perceptions of school rules, the presence of weapons
and gangs in school, the presence of hate-related words
and graffiti in school, student reports of bullying and
reports of rejection at school, and the availability of
drugs and alcohol in school. Students are also asked
attitudinal questions relating to fear of victimization
and avoidance behavior at school.
The SCS survey was conducted for a 6-month period
from January through June in all households selected
for the NCVS (see discussion above for information
about the NCVS sampling design and changes to the
race/ethnicity variable beginning in 2003). Within
these households, the eligible respondents for the SCS
were those household members who had attended
school at any time during the 6 months preceding
the interview, were enrolled in grades 6–12, and were
not home schooled. In 2007, the questionnaire was
changed and household members who attended school
sometime during the school year of the interview were
included. The age range of students covered in this
report is 12–18 years of age. Eligible respondents were
asked the supplemental questions in the SCS only after
completing their entire NCVS interview. It should be
noted that the first or unbounded NCVS interview
174

Appendix A: Technical Notes

has always been included in analysis of the SCS data
and may result in the reporting of events outside of
the requested reference period.
The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999,
2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013
was calculated by using NCVS incident variables
appended to the SCS data files of the same year. The
NCVS type of crime variable was used to classify
victimizations of students in the SCS as serious violent,
violent, or theft. The NCVS variables asking where the
incident happened (at school) and what the victim was
doing when it happened (attending school or on the
way to or from school) were used to ascertain whether
the incident happened at school. Only incidents that
occurred inside the United States are included.
In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modified
from previous collections. First, in 1995 and 1999, “at
school” was defined for respondents as in the school
building, on the school grounds, or on a school bus.
In 2001, the definition for “at school” was changed
to mean in the school building, on school property,
on a school bus, or going to and from school. This
change was made to the 2001 questionnaire in order
to be consistent with the definition of “at school” as it
is constructed in the NCVS and was also used as the
definition in subsequent SCS collections. Cognitive
interviews conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on
the 1999 SCS suggested that modifications to the
definition of “at school” would not have a substantial
impact on the estimates.
A total of about 9,700 students participated in the
1995 SCS, 8,400 in 1999, 8,400 in 2001, 7,200 in
2003, 6,300 in 2005, 5,600 in 2007, 5,000 in 2009,
6,500 in 2011, and 5,700 in 2013. In the 2013 SCS,
the household completion rate was 86 percent.
In the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009,
2011, and 2013 SCS, the household completion rates
were 95 percent, 94 percent, 93 percent, 92 percent,
91 percent, 90 percent, 92 percent, 91 percent, and 86
percent respectively, and the student completion rates
were 78 percent, 78 percent, 77 percent, 70 percent,
62 percent, 58 percent, 56 percent, 63 percent, and
60 percent respectively. The overall unweighted SCS
unit response rate (calculated by multiplying the
household completion rate by the student completion
rate) was about 74 percent in 1995, 73 percent in 1999,
72 percent in 2001, 64 percent in 2003, 56 percent
in 2005, 53 percent in 2007, 51 percent in 2009, 57
percent in 2011, and 51 percent in 2013.
There are two types of nonresponse: unit and item
nonresponse. NCES requires that any stage of data
collection within a survey that has a unit base-weighted

response rate of less than 85 percent be evaluated for
the potential magnitude of unit nonresponse bias
before the data or any analysis using the data may be
released (U.S. Department of Education 2003). Due to
the low unit response rate in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011,
and 2013, a unit nonresponse bias analysis was done.
Unit response rates indicate how many sampled units
have completed interviews. Because interviews with
students could only be completed after households
had responded to the NCVS, the unit completion
rate for the SCS reflects both the household interview
completion rate and the student interview completion
rate. Nonresponse can greatly affect the strength and
application of survey data by leading to an increase in
variance as a result of a reduction in the actual size of
the sample and can produce bias if the nonrespondents
have characteristics of interest that are different from
the respondents.
In order for response bias to occur, respondents
must have different response rates and responses to
particular survey variables. The magnitude of unit
nonresponse bias is determined by the response
rate and the differences between respondents and
nonrespondents on key survey variables. Although the
bias analysis cannot measure response bias since the
SCS is a sample survey and it is not known how the
population would have responded, the SCS sampling
frame has four key student or school characteristic
variables for which data are known for respondents
and nonrespondents: sex, race/ethnicity, household
income, and urbanicity, all of which are associated
with student victimization. To the extent that there are
differential responses by respondents in these groups,
nonresponse bias is a concern.
In 2005, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of bias for the race, household income,
and urbanicity variables. White (non-Hispanic)
and Other (non-Hispanic) respondents had higher
response rates than Black (non-Hispanic) and
Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households
with an income of $35,000–$49,999 and $50,000
or more had higher response rates than those from
households with incomes of less than $7,500,
$7,500–$14,999, $15,000–$24,999 and $25,000–
$34,999. Respondents who live in urban areas had
lower response rates than those who live in rural or
suburban areas. Although the extent of nonresponse
bias cannot be determined, weighting adjustments,
which corrected for differential response rates, should
have reduced the problem.
In 2007, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of bias by the race/ethnicity and household
income variables. Hispanic respondents had lower
response rates than other races/ethnicities.

Respondents from households with an income of
$25,000 or more had higher response rates than those
from households with incomes of less than $25,000.
However, when responding students are compared to
the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable
differences between the responding students and the
eligible students, suggesting that the nonresponse bias
has little impact on the overall estimates.
In 2009, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of potential bias for the race/ethnicity and
urbanicity variables. White students and students of
other races/ethnicities had higher response rates than
did Black and Hispanic respondents. Respondents
from households located in rural areas had higher
response rates than those from households located in
urban areas. However, when responding students are
compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were
no measurable differences between the responding
students and the eligible students, suggesting
that the nonresponse bias has little impact on the
overall estimates.
In 2011, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of potential bias for the age variable.
Respondents 12 to 17 years old had higher response
rates than did 18-year-old respondents in the NCVS
and SCS interviews. Weighting the data adjusts for
unequal selection probabilities and for the effects of
nonresponse. The weighting adjustments that correct
for differential response rates are created by region,
age, race, and sex, and should have reduced the effect
of nonresponse.
In 2013, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of potential bias for the age, region, and
Hispanic origin variable in the NCVS interview
response. Within the SCS portion of the data, only
the age and region variables showed significant unit
nonresponse bias. Further analysis indicated only the
age 14 and the west region categories showed positive
response biases that were significantly different from
some of the other categories within the age and region
variables. Based on the analysis, nonresponse bias
seems to have little impact on the SCS results.
Response rates for most SCS survey items in all
survey years were high—typically over 97 percent
of all eligible respondents, meaning there is little
potential for item nonresponse bias for most items in
the survey. Weights were developed to compensate for
differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse.
The weighted data permit inferences about the eligible
student population who were enrolled in schools
in all SCS data years. For more information about

Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)
The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System
(YRBSS) is an epidemiological surveillance system
developed by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) to monitor the prevalence of youth
behaviors that most influence health. The YRBSS
focuses on priority health-risk behaviors established
during youth that result in the most significant
mortality, morbidity, disability, and social problems
during both youth and adulthood. The YRBSS
includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior
Survey (YRBS) as well as surveys conducted in states
and large urban school districts. This report uses 1993,
1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009,
2011, and 2013 YRBSS data.
The national YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling
design to produce a nationally representative sample
of students in grades 9–12 in the United States. The
target population consisted of all public and private
school students in grades 9–12 in the 50 states and the
District of Columbia. The first-stage sampling frame
included selecting primary sampling units (PSUs)
from strata formed on the basis of urbanization
and the relative percentage of Black and Hispanic
students in the PSU. These PSUs are either counties;
subareas of large counties; or groups of smaller,
adjacent counties. At the second stage, schools were
selected with probability proportional to school
enrollment size.
The final stage of sampling consisted of randomly
selecting, in each chosen school and in each of
grades 9–12, one or two classrooms from either a
required subject, such as English or social studies,
or a required period, such as homeroom or second
period. All students in selected classes were eligible
to participate. In surveys conducted before 2013,
three strategies were used to oversample Black and
Hispanic students: (1) larger sampling rates were
used to select PSUs that are in high-Black and highHispanic strata; (2) a modified measure of size was
used that increased the probability of selecting schools
with a disproportionately high minority enrollment;
and (3) two classes per grade, rather than one,
were selected in schools with a high percentage of
combined Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or
176

Appendix A: Technical Notes

American Indian/Alaska Native enrollment. In 2013,
only selection of two classes per grade was needed
to achieve an adequate precision with minimum
variance. Approximately 16,300 students participated
in the 1993 survey, 10,900 students participated in
the 1995 survey, 16,300 students participated in
the 1997 survey, 15,300 students participated in the
1999 survey, 13,600 students participated in the 2001
survey, 15,200 students participated in the 2003
survey, 13,900 students participated in the 2005
survey, 14,000 students participated in the 2007
survey, 16,400 students participated in the 2009
survey, 15,400 participated in the 2011 survey, and
13,600 participated in the 2013 survey.
The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993
survey, 60 percent for the 1995 survey, 69 percent for
the 1997 survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey, 63
percent for the 2001 survey, 67 percent for the 2003
survey, 67 percent for the 2005 survey, 68 percent for
the 2007 survey, 71 percent for the 2009 survey, 71
percent for the 2011 survey, and 68 percent for the
2013 survey. NCES standards call for response rates
of 85 percent or better for cross-sectional surveys,
and bias analyses are required by NCES when that
percentage is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full
nonresponse bias analysis has not been done because
the data necessary to do the analysis are not available.
The weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse
and the oversampling of Black and Hispanic students
in the sample. The final weights were constructed
so that only weighted proportions of students (not
weighted counts of students) in each grade matched
national population projections.
State-level data were downloaded from the Youth
Online: Comprehensive Results web page (http://
nccd.cdc.gov/YouthOnline/). Each state and district
school-based YRBS employs a two-stage, cluster
sample design to produce representative samples of
students in grades 9–12 in their jurisdiction. All except
a few state samples, and all district samples, include
only public schools, and each district sample includes
only schools in the funded school district (e.g., San
Diego Unified School District) rather than in the
entire city (e.g., greater San Diego area).
In the first sampling stage in all except a few states
and districts, schools are selected with probability
proportional to school enrollment size. In the second
sampling stage, intact classes of a required subject or
intact classes during a required period (e.g., second
period) are selected randomly. All students in sampled
classes are eligible to participate. Certain states and
districts modify these procedures to meet their
individual needs. For example, in a given state or
district, all schools, rather than a sample of schools,

might be selected to participate. State and local surveys
that have a scientifically selected sample, appropriate
documentation, and an overall response rate greater
than or equal to 60 percent are weighted. The
overall response rate reflects the school response rate
multiplied by the student response rate. These three
criteria are used to ensure that the data from those
surveys can be considered representative of students
in grades 9–12 in that jurisdiction. A weight is applied
to each record to adjust for student nonresponse and
the distribution of students by grade, sex, and race/
ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore, weighted
estimates are representative of all students in grades
9–12 attending schools in each jurisdiction. Surveys
that do not have an overall response rate of greater
than or equal to 60 percent and that do not have
appropriate documentation are not weighted and are
not included in this report.
In 2013, a total of 42 states and 21 districts had
weighted data. Not all of the districts were contained
in the 42 states. For example, California was not
one of the 42 states that obtained weighted data
but it contained several districts that did. For more
information on the location of the districts, please see
http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/participation.
htm. In sites with weighted data, the student sample
sizes for the state and district YRBS ranged from 1,107
to 53,785. School response rates ranged from 70 to
100 percent, student response rates ranged from 60
to 94 percent, and overall response rates ranged from
60 to 87 percent.
Readers should note that reports of these data
published by the CDC and in this report do not
include percentages where the denominator includes
less than 100 unweighted cases.
In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office
of Management and Budget’s standards for the
classification of federal data on race and ethnicity,
the YRBS item on race/ethnicity was modified. The
version of the race and ethnicity question used in 1993,
1995, and 1997 was:
How do you describe yourself?
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.

White—not Hispanic
Black—not Hispanic
Hispanic or Latino
Asian or Pacific Islander
American Indian or Alaskan Native
Other

The version used in 1999, 2001, 2003, and in the
2005, 2007, and 2009 state and local district surveys
was:

How do you describe yourself? (Select one or more
responses.)
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.

American Indian or Alaska Native
Asian
Black or African American
Hispanic or Latino
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
White

In the 2005 national survey and in all 2007, 2009,
2011, and 2013 surveys, race/ethnicity was computed
from two questions: (1) “Are you Hispanic or Latino?”
(response options were “yes” and “no”), and (2) “What
is your race?” (response options were “American
Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian,” “Black or African
American,” “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific
Islander,” or “White”). For the second question,
students could select more than one response option.
For this report, students were classified as “Hispanic”
if they answered “yes” to the first question, regardless
of how they answered the second question. Students
who answered “no” to the first question and selected
more than one race/ethnicity in the second category
were classified as “More than one race.” Students who
answered “no” to the first question and selected only
one race/ethnicity were classified as that race/ethnicity.
Race/ethnicity was classified as missing for students
who did not answer the first question and for students
who answered “no” to the first question but did not
answer the second question.
CDC has conducted two studies to understand the
effect of changing the race/ethnicity item on the
YRBS. Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found
that allowing students to select more than one
response to a single race/ethnicity question on the
YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/
ethnicity among high school students. Eaton, Brener,
Kann, and Pittman (2007) found that self-reported
race/ethnicity was similar regardless of whether the
single-question or a two-question format was used.

Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS)
The Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) is a set of
related questionnaires that collect descriptive data
on the context of public and private elementary and
secondary education. Data reported by districts,
schools, principals, and teachers provide a variety
of statistics on the condition of education in the
United States that may be used by policy makers
and the general public. The SASS system covers a
wide range of topics, including teacher demand,
teacher and principal characteristics, teachers’ and
principals’ perceptions of school climate and problems
in their schools, teacher and principal compensation,
district hiring and retention practices, general
conditions in schools, and basic characteristics of the
student population.
SASS data are collected through a mail questionnaire
with telephone and in-person field follow-up. SASS
has been conducted by the Census Bureau for NCES
since the first administration of the survey, which
was conducted during the 1987–88 school year.
Subsequent SASS administrations were conducted in
1990–91, 1993–94, 1999–2000, 2003–04, 2007–08,
and 2011–12.
SASS is designed to produce national, regional, and
state estimates for public elementary and secondary
schools, school districts, principals, teachers, and
school library media centers; and national and
regional estimates for public charter schools, as well as
principals, teachers, and school library media centers
within these schools. For private schools, the sample
supports national, regional, and affiliation estimates
for schools, principals, and teachers.
From its inception, SASS has had four core components:
school questionnaires, teacher questionnaires,
principal questionnaires, and school district (prior
to 1999–2000, “teacher demand and shortage”)
questionnaires. A fifth component, school library
media center questionnaires, was introduced in the
1993–94 administration and has been included in
every subsequent administration of SASS. School
library data were also collected in the 1990–91
administration of the survey through the school and
principal questionnaires.
School questionnaires used in SASS include the
Public and Private School Questionnaires; teacher
questionnaires include the Public and Private School
Teacher Questionnaires; principal questionnaires
include the Public and Private School Principal (or
School Administrator) Questionnaires, and school
district questionnaires include the School District
(or Teacher Demand and Shortage) Questionnaires.

Appendix A: Technical Notes

Although the four core questionnaires and the school
library media questionnaires have remained relatively
stable over the various administrations of SASS, the
survey has changed to accommodate emerging issues
in elementary and secondary education. Some items
have been added, some have been deleted, and some
questionnaire items have been reworded.
During the 1990–91 SASS cycle, NCES worked
with the Office of Indian Education to add an Indian
School Questionnaire to SASS, and it remained a
part of SASS through 2007–08. The Indian School
Questionnaire explores the same school-level issues
that the Public and Private School Questionnaires
explore, allowing comparisons among the three types
of schools. The 1990–91, 1993–94, 1999–2000,
2003–04, and 2007–08 administrations of SASS
obtained data on Bureau of Indian Education (BIE)
schools (schools funded or operated by the BIE), but
the 2011–12 administration did not obtain BIE data.
SASS estimates for all survey years presented in this
report exclude BIE schools, and as a result, estimates
in this report may differ from those in previously
published reports.
School library media center questionnaires were
administered in public, private, and BIE schools as
part of the 1993–94 and 1999–2000 SASS. During
the 2003–04 administration of SASS, only library
media centers in public schools were surveyed, and
in 2007–08 library media centers in public schools
and BIE and BIE-funded schools were surveyed.
The 2011–12 survey collected data only on school
library media centers in traditional public schools
and in public charter schools. School library questions
focused on facilities, services and policies, staffing,
technology, information literacy, collections and
expenditures, and media equipment. New or revised
topics included access to online licensed databases,
resource availability, and additional elements on
information literacy. The Student Records and
Library Media Specialist/Librarian Questionnaires
were administered only in 1993–94.
As part of the 1999–2000 SASS, the Charter School
Questionnaire was sent to the universe of charter
schools in operation in 1998–99. In 2003–04 and in
subsequent administrations of SASS, charter schools
were included in the public school sample as opposed
to being sent a separate questionnaire. Another change
in the 2003–04 administration of SASS was a revised
data collection procedure using a primary in-person
contact within the school intended to reduce the field
follow-up phase.
The SASS teacher surveys collect information on the
characteristics of teachers, such as their age, race/

ethnicity, years of teaching experience, average number
of hours per week spent on teaching activities, base
salary, average class size, and highest degree earned.
These teacher-reported data may be combined with
related information on their school’s characteristics,
such as school type (e.g., public traditional, public
charter, Catholic, private other religious, and
private nonsectarian), community type, and school
enrollment size. The teacher questionnaires also ask
for information on teacher opinions regarding the
school and teaching environment. In 1993–94, about
53,000 public school teachers and 10,400 private
school teachers were sampled. In 1999–2000, about
56,300 public school teachers, 4,400 public charter
school teachers, and 10,800 private school teachers
were sampled. In 2003–04, about 52,500 public
school teachers and 10,000 private school teachers
were sampled. In 2007–08, about 48,400 public
school teachers and 8,200 private school teachers
were sampled. In 2011–12, about 51,100 public
school teachers and 7,100 private school teachers were
sampled. Weighted overall response rates in 2011–12
were 61.8 percent for public school teachers and 50.1
percent for private school teachers.
The SASS principal surveys focus on such topics as
age, race/ethnicity, sex, average annual salary, years
of experience, highest degree attained, perceived
influence on decisions made at the school, and hours
spent per week on all school activities. These data on
principals can be placed in the context of other SASS
data, such as the type of the principal’s school (e.g.,
public traditional, public charter, Catholic, other
religious, or nonsectarian), enrollment, and percentage
of students eligible for free or reduced price lunch.
In 2003–04, about 10,200 public school principals
were sampled, and in 2007–08, about 9,800 public
school principals were sampled. In 2011–12, about
11,000 public school principals and 3,000 private
school principals were sampled. Weighted response
rates in 2011–12 for public school principals and
private school principals were 72.7 percent and 64.7
percent, respectively.
The SASS 2011–12 sample of schools was confined
to the 50 states and the District of Columbia and
excludes the other jurisdictions, the Department
of Defense overseas schools, the BIE schools, and
schools that do not offer teacher-provided classroom
instruction in grades 1–12 or the ungraded equivalent.
The SASS 2011–12 sample included 10,250 traditional
public schools, 750 public charter schools, and 3,000
private schools.
The public school sample for the 2011–12 SASS
was based on an adjusted public school universe file
from the 2009–10 Common Core of Data (CCD),
a database of all the nation’s public school districts

and public schools. The private school sample for
the 2011–12 SASS was selected from the 2009–10
Private School Universe Survey (PSS), as updated for
the 2011–12 PSS. This update collected membership
lists from private school associations and religious
denominations, as well as private school lists from state
education departments. The 2011–12 SASS private
school frame was further augmented by the inclusion
of additional schools that were identified through the
2009–10 PSS area frame data collection.

School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)
The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)
is managed by the National Center for Education
Statistics (NCES) on behalf of the U.S. Department
of Education. SSOCS collects extensive crime and
safety data from principals and school administrators
of U.S. public schools. Data from this collection can
be used to examine the relationship between school
characteristics and violent and serious violent crimes
in primary schools, middle schools, high schools, and
combined schools. In addition, data from SSOCS can
be used to assess what crime prevention programs,
practices, and policies are used by schools. SSOCS has
been conducted in school years 1999–2000, 2003–04,
2005–06, 2007–08, and 2009–10.
SSOCS was developed by NCES and is funded by
the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools of the U.S.
Department of Education. The 2009–10 SSOCS
(SSOCS: 2010) was conducted by the U.S. Census
Bureau. Data collection began on February 24,
2010, when questionnaire packets were mailed to
sampled schools, and continued through June 11,
2010. A total of 2,648 public schools submitted usable

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2014

179

questionnaires: 684 primary schools, 909 middle
schools, 948 high schools, and 107 combined schools.
The sampling frame for SSOCS: 2010 was constructed
from the 2007–08 Public Elementary/Secondary
School Universe data file of the Common Core of
Data (CCD), an annual collection of data on all
public K–12 schools and school districts. The SSOCS
sampling frame was restricted to regular public schools
in the United States and the District of Columbia
(including charter schools).
A total of 3,476 schools were selected for the 2010
study. In February 2010, questionnaires were mailed
to school principals, who were asked to complete the
survey or to have it completed by the person most
knowledgeable about discipline issues at the school.
A total of 2,648 schools completed the survey. The
weighted overall response rate was 80.8 percent.1 A
nonresponse bias analysis was conducted on the 3
items with weighted item nonresponse rates below
85 percent. The detected bias was not deemed
problematic enough to suppress any items from the
data file. A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted
to evaluate the extent of bias for any survey stage
with a base-weighted unit response rate less than
85 percent. Responding and nonresponding schools
were compared across the characteristics available
for both groups: school level, enrollment size, locale,
percent White enrollment, region, number of full-time
equivalent (FTE) teachers, student-to-teacher ratio,
and percentage of students eligible for free or reducedprice lunch. This analysis indicated that there were
no measurable differences between the responding
schools and the full sample of schools, suggesting that
nonresponse bias is not an issue for SSOCS: 2010.
Weights were developed to adjust for the variable
probabilities of selection and differential nonresponse
and can be used to produce national estimates for
regular public schools in the 2009–10 school year. For
information on the 1999–2000, 2003–04, 2005–06,
2007–08, and 2009–10 iterations, see Neiman (2011).

Campus Safety and Security Survey
The Campus Safety and Security Survey is administered
by the Office of Postsecondary Education. Since 1990,
all postsecondary institutions participating in Title
IV student financial aid programs have been required
to comply with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus
Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, known
as the Clery Act. Originally, Congress enacted the
Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act, which
was amended in 1992, 1998, and again in 2000. The
1998 amendments renamed the law the Jeanne Clery
Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus
Crime Statistics Act. The Clery Act requires schools to
give timely warnings of crimes to the student body
and staff; to publicize campus crime and safety
policies; and to collect, report, and disseminate
campus crime data.
Crime statistics are collected and disseminated by
campus security authorities. These authorities include
campus police; non-police security staff responsible
for monitoring campus property; municipal, county,
or state law enforcement agencies with institutional
agreements for security services; individuals and offices
designated by the campus security policies as those to
whom crimes should be reported; and officials of the
institution with significant responsibility for student
and campus activities. The act requires disclosure for
offenses committed at geographic locations associated
with each institution. For on-campus crimes, this
includes property and buildings owned or controlled
by the institution. In addition to on-campus crimes,
the act requires disclosure of crimes committed in
or on a non-campus building or property owned or
controlled by the institution for educational purposes
or for recognized student organizations, and on public
property within or immediately adjacent to and
accessible from the campus.
There are three types of statistics described in this
report: criminal offenses; arrests for illegal weapons
possession and violation of drug and liquor laws; and
disciplinary referrals for illegal weapons possession
and violation of drug and liquor laws. Criminal
offenses include homicide, sex offenses, robbery,
aggravated assaults, burglary, motor vehicle theft,
and arson. Only the most serious offense is counted
when more than one offense was committed during
an incident. The two other categories, arrests and
referrals, include counts for illegal weapons possession
and violation of drug and liquor laws. Arrests and
referrals relate to only those that are in violation of the
law and not just in violation of institutional policies. If
no federal, state, or local law was violated, these events
are not reported. Further, if an individual is arrested

and referred for disciplinary action for an offense,
only the arrest is counted. Arrest is defined to include
persons processed by arrest, citation, or summons,
including those arrested and released without formal
charges being placed. Referral for disciplinary action
is defined to include persons referred to any official
who initiates a disciplinary action of which a record
is kept and which may result in the imposition of a
sanction. Referrals may or may not involve the police
or other law enforcement agencies.
All criminal offenses and arrests may include students,
faculty, staff, and the general public. These offenses
may or may not involve students that are enrolled in
the institution. Referrals primarily deal with persons
associated formally with the institution (i.e., students,
faculty, staff).
Campus security and police statistics do not necessarily
reflect the total amount or even the nature of crime
on campus. Rather, they reflect incidents that have
been reported and recorded by campus security and/
or local police. The process of reporting and recording
alleged criminal incidents involve some well-known
social filters and steps beginning with the victim. First,
the victim or some other party must recognize that
a possible crime has occurred and report the event.
The event must then be recorded, and if it is recorded,
the nature and type of offense must be classified. This
classification may differ from the initial report due to
the collection of additional evidence, interviews with
witnesses, or through officer discretion. Also, the date
an incident is reported may be much later than the
date of the actual incident. For example, a victim may
not realize something was stolen until much later, or a
victim of violence may wait a number of days to report
a crime. Other factors are related to the probability
that an incident is reported, including the severity of
the event, the victim’s confidence and prior experience
with the police or security agency, or influence from
third parties (e.g., friends and family knowledgeable
about the incident). Finally the reader should be
mindful that these figures represent alleged criminal
offenses reported to campus security and/or local
police within a given year, and they do not necessarily
reflect prosecutions or convictions for crime. More
information on the reporting of campus crime and
safety data may be obtained from: The Handbook for

EDFacts
EDFacts is a centralized data collection through
which state education agencies submit K–12 education
data to the U.S. Department of Education (ED). All
data in EDFacts are organized into “data groups”
and reported to ED using defined file specifications.
Depending on the data group, state education
agencies may submit aggregate counts for the state
as a whole or detailed counts for individual schools
or school districts. EDFacts does not collect studentlevel records. The entities that are required to report
EDFacts data vary by data group but may include the
50 states, the District of Columbia, the Department
of Defense (DoD) dependents schools, the Bureau of
Indian Education, Puerto Rico, American Samoa,
Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S.
Virgin Islands. More information about EDFacts file
specifications and data groups can be found at http://
www.ed.gov/EDFacts.
EDFacts is a universe collection and is not subject
to sampling error, but nonsampling errors such as
nonresponse and inaccurate reporting may occur. The
U.S. Department of Education attempts to minimize
nonsampling errors by training data submission
coordinators and reviewing the quality of state data
submissions. However, anomalies may still be present
in the data.
Differences in state data collection systems may limit
the comparability of EDFacts data across states and
across time. To build EDFacts files, state education
agencies rely on data that were reported by their
schools and school districts. The systems used to
collect these data are evolving rapidly and differ from
state to state. For example, there is a large shift in
California’s firearm incident data between 2010–11
and 2011–12. California cited a new student data
system that more accurately collects firearm incident
data as the reason for the magnitude of the difference.
In some cases, EDFacts data may not align with data
reported on state education agency websites. States
may update their websites on different schedules
than those they use to report to ED. Further, ED
may use methods to protect the privacy of individuals
represented within the data that could be different
from the methods used by an individual state.
EDFacts firearm incidents data are collected in data
group 601 within file 094. EDFacts collects this data
group on behalf of the Office of Safe and Healthy
Students in the Office of Elementary and Secondary
Education. The definition for this data group is “The
number of incidents involving students who brought
or possessed firearms at school.” The reporting period

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2014

181

is the entire school year. Data group 601 collects
separate counts for incidents involving handguns,
rifles/shotguns, other firearms, and multiple weapon
types. The counts reported here exclude the “other
firearms” category. For more information about this
data group, please see file specification 094 for the
relevant school year, available at http://www2.ed.gov/

Accuracy of Estimates
The accuracy of any statistic is determined by the joint
effects of nonsampling and sampling errors. Both
types of error affect the estimates presented in this
report. Several sources can contribute to nonsampling
errors. For example, members of the population of
interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling
frame; sampled members refuse to answer some of
the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of
the survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse);
mistakes are made during data editing, coding,
or entry; the responses that respondents provide
differ from the “true” responses; or measurement
instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail
to measure the characteristics they are intended
to measure. Although nonsampling errors due to
questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced
somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and
imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors
or gauging the effects of these errors is usually difficult.
Sampling errors occur because observations are made
on samples rather than on entire populations. Surveys
of population universes are not subject to sampling
errors. Estimates based on a sample will differ
somewhat from those that would have been obtained by
a complete census of the relevant population using the
same survey instruments, instructions, and procedures.
The standard error of a statistic is a measure of the
variation due to sampling; it indicates the precision of
the statistic obtained in a particular sample. In addition,
the standard errors for two sample statistics can be used
to estimate the precision of the difference between
the two statistics and to help determine whether the

182

Appendix A: Technical Notes

difference based on the sample is large enough so that
it represents the population difference.
Most of the data used in this report were obtained
from complex sampling designs rather than a simple
random design. The features of complex sampling
require different techniques to calculate standard errors
than are used for data collected using a simple random
sampling. Therefore, calculation of standard errors
requires procedures that are markedly different from
the ones used when the data are from a simple random
sample. The Taylor series approximation technique or
the balanced repeated replication (BRR) method was
used to estimate most of the statistics and their standard
errors in this report.
Standard error calculation for data from the School
Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series
approximation method using PSU and strata
variables available from each dataset. For statistics
based on all years of NCVS data, standard errors
were derived from a formula developed by the U.S.
Census Bureau, which consists of three generalized
variance function (gvf) constant parameters that
represent the curve fitted to the individual standard
errors calculated using the Jackknife Repeated
Replication technique.
The coefficient of variation (CV ) represents the ratio
of the standard error to the mean. As an attribute
of a distribution, the CV is an important measure of
the reliability and accuracy of an estimate. With the
exception of Indicator 2, the CV was calculated for
all estimates in this report, and in cases where the CV
was between 30 and 50 percent the estimates were
noted with a ! symbol (interpret data with caution).
In Indicator 2, the “!” symbol cautions the reader that
estimates marked indicate that the reported statistic
was based on fewer than 10 cases. With the exception
of Indicator 2, in cases where the CV was 50 percent
or greater, the estimate was determined not to meet
reporting standards and was suppressed.

Statistical Procedures
The comparisons in the text have been tested for
statistical significance to ensure that the differences
are larger than might be expected due to sampling
variation. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited
in the report are statistically significant at the .05 level.
Several test procedures were used, depending upon
the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the
statement being tested. The primary test procedure
used in this report was Student’s t statistic, which tests
the difference between two sample estimates. The t test

formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons.
The formula used to compute the t statistic is as follows:

t=

E1 - E2
√se  12

+

	

(1)

se  22

where E1 and E2 are the estimates to be compared
and se1 and se2 are their corresponding standard
errors. Note that this formula is valid only for
independent estimates. When the estimates are not
independent (for example, when comparing a total
percentage with that for a subgroup included in
the total), a covariance term (i.e., 2 * r * se1 * se2)
must be subtracted from the denominator of the
formula:

t=

E1 - E2
√se  12

+

se  22 -

	

(2 * r * se1 * se2 )

(2)

where r is the correlation coefficient. Once the t value
was computed, it was compared to the published tables
of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels.
For this report, an alpha value of .05 was used, which
has a t value of 1.96. If the t value was larger than
1.96, then the difference between the two estimates
is statistically significant at the 95 percent level.
A linear trend test was used when differences among
percentages were examined relative to ordered
categories of a variable, rather than the differences
between two discrete categories. This test allows one
to examine whether, for example, the percentage
of students using drugs increased (or decreased)
over time or whether the percentage of students
who reported being physically attacked in school

increased (or decreased) with their age. Based on
a regression with, for example, student’s age as the
independent variable and whether a student was
physically attacked as the dependent variable, the
test involves computing the regression coefficient (b)
and its corresponding standard error (se). The ratio
of these two (b/se) is the test statistic t. If t is greater
than 1.96, the critical value for one comparison at
the .05 alpha level, the hypothesis that there is no
linear relationship between student’s age and being
physically attacked is rejected.
Some comparisons among categories of an ordered
variable with three or more levels involved a test for a
linear trend across all categories, rather than a series
of tests between pairs of categories. In this report,
when differences among percentages were examined
relative to a variable with ordered categories, analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear
relationship between the two variables. To do this,
ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts
corresponding to successive levels of the independent
variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors
(that is, standard errors that were calculated by the
Taylor series method), the variance between the
means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used
to partition the total sum of squares into within- and
between-group sums of squares. These were used to
create mean squares for the within- and betweengroup variance components and their corresponding
F statistics, which were then compared to published
values of F for a significance level of .05. Significant
values of both the overall F and the F associated with
the linear contrast term were required as evidence of
a linear relationship between the two variables.

Appendix B:
Glossary of
Terms

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2014

185

General Terms
Crime Any violation of a statute or regulation or any
act that the government has determined is injurious
to the public, including felonies and misdemeanors.
Such violation may or may not involve violence, and
it may affect individuals or property.
Incident A specific criminal act or offense involving
one or more victims and one or more offenders.
Multistage sampling A survey sampling technique in
which there is more than one wave of sampling. That
is, one sample of units is drawn, and then another
sample is drawn within that sample. For example,
at the first stage, a number of Census blocks may be
sampled out of all the Census blocks in the United
States. At the second stage, households are sampled
within the previously sampled Census blocks.
Prevalence The percentage of the population directly
affected by crime in a given period. This rate is based
upon specific information elicited directly from the
respondent regarding crimes committed against his
or her person, against his or her property, or against
an individual bearing a unique relationship to him
or her. It is not based upon perceptions and beliefs
about, or reactions to, criminal acts.
School An education institution consisting of one or
more of grades K through 12.
School crime Any criminal activity that is committed
on school property.
School year The 12-month period of time denoting
the beginning and ending dates for school accounting
purposes, usually from July 1 through June 30.
Stratification A survey sampling technique in
which the target population is divided into mutually
exclusive groups or strata based on some variable or
variables (e.g., metropolitan area) and sampling of
units occurs separately within each stratum.

Suicide An act of taking one’s own life voluntarily
and intentionally.
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
Aggravated assault Attack or attempted attack with
a weapon, regardless of whether or not an injury
occurs, and attack without a weapon when serious
injury results.
At school (students) Inside the school building, on
school property (school parking area, play area, school
bus, etc.), or on the way to or from school.
Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) Geographic
entities defined by the U.S. Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for use by federal statistical
agencies in collecting, tabulating, and publishing
federal statistics.
Rape Forced sexual intercourse including both
psychological coercion as well as physical force.
Forced sexual intercourse means vaginal, anal, or
oral penetration by the offender(s). Includes attempts
and verbal threats of rape. This category also includes
incidents where the penetration is from a foreign
object, such as a bottle.
Robbery Completed or attempted theft, directly
from a person, of property or cash by force or threat
of force, with or without a weapon, and with or
without injury.
Serious violent victimization Rape, sexual assault,
robbery, or aggravated assault.

Unequal probabilities A survey sampling technique
in which sampled units do not have the same
probability of selection into the sample. For example,
the investigator may oversample rural students in
order to increase the sample sizes of rural students.
Rural students would then be more likely than other
students to be sampled.

Sexual assault A wide range of victimizations,
separate from rape or attempted rape. These crimes
include attacks or attempted attacks generally
involving unwanted sexual contact between the
victim and offender. Sexual assault may or may not
involve force and includes such things as grabbing or
fondling. Sexual assault also includes verbal threats.

Specific Terms Used in Various Surveys

Simple assault Attack without a weapon resulting
either in no injury, minor injury, or an undetermined
injury requiring less than 2 days of hospitalization.
Also includes attempted assault without a weapon.

School-Associated Violent Deaths Study (SAVD)
Homicide An act involving a killing of one person by
another resulting from interpersonal violence.

186

School-associated violent death A homicide or
suicide in which the fatal injury occurred on the
campus of a functioning elementary or secondary
school in the United States, while the victim was on
the way to or from regular sessions at such a school, or
while the victim was attending or traveling to or from
an official school-sponsored event. Victims included
nonstudents as well as students and staff members.

Appendix B: Glossary of Terms

Theft Completed or attempted theft of property or
cash without personal contact.
Victimization A crime as it affects one individual
person or household. For personal crimes, the
number of victimizations is equal to the number of
victims involved. The number of victimizations may
be greater than the number of incidents because
more than one person may be victimized during an
incident.
Victimization rate A measure of the occurrence of
victimizations among a specific population group. For
personal crimes, the number of victimizations is equal
to the number of victims involved. Each victimization
that is reported by the respondents is counted, so
there may be one incident with two victims, which
would be counted as two victimizations. The number
of victimizations may be greater than the number
of incidents because more than one person may be
victimized during an incident.
Violent victimization Includes serious violent
victimization, rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated
assault, or simple assault.

Hate-related words Students were asked if anyone
called them an insulting or bad name at school having
to do with their race, religion, ethnic background
or national origin, disability, gender, or sexual
orientation.
Serious violent victimization Rape, sexual assault,
robbery, or aggravated assault.
Total victimization Combination of violent
victimization and theft. If a student reported an
incident of either type, he or she is counted as having
experienced any victimization. If the student reported
having experienced both, he or she is counted once
under “total victimization.”
Violent victimization Includes serious violent
victimization, rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated
assault, or simple assault.

City A territory inside an urbanized area (defined as
densely settled “cores” with populations of 50,000 or
more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely
settled surrounding areas) and inside a principal
city (defined as a city that contains the primary
population and economic center of a metropolitan
statistical area, which, in turn, is defined as one or
more contiguous counties that have a “core” area with
a large population nucleus and adjacent communities
that are highly integrated economically or socially
with the core).

Instructional level Teachers are divided into
elementary or secondary based on a combination
of the grades taught, main teaching assignment,
and the structure of their classes. Those with only
ungraded classes become elementary level teachers
if their main assignment is Early childhood/Pre-k or
Elementary, or they teach either special education in a
self-contained classroom or an elementary enrichment
class. All other teachers with ungraded classes are
classified as secondary level. Among teachers with
regularly graded classes, elementary level teachers
generally teach any of grades Pre-k–5; report an
Early childhood/Pre-k, Elementary, Self-contained
special education, or Elementary enrichment main
assignment; or the majority of grades taught are K–6.
In general, secondary level teachers instruct any of
grades 7–12 but usually no grade lower than 5th. They
also teach more of grades 7–12 than lower level grades.
Rural A territory outside any urbanized area (defined
as densely settled “cores” with populations of 50,000
or more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent
densely settled surrounding areas) or urban cluster
(defined as densely settled “cores” with populations
between 25,000 and 50,000 of Census-defined blocks
with adjacent densely settled surrounding areas).
Secondary school A school in which the lowest grade
is greater than or equal to grade 7 and the highest
grade is less than or equal to grade 12.
Secondary teachers See instructional level.
Suburban A territory outside a principal city (defined
as a city that contains the primary population and
economic center of a metropolitan statistical area,
which, in turn, is defined as one or more contiguous
counties that have a “core” area with a large
population nucleus and adjacent communities that
are highly integrated economically or socially with
the core) and inside an urbanized area (defined as
densely settled “cores” with populations of 50,000 or
more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely
settled surrounding areas).
Town A territory inside an urban cluster (defined
as densely settled “cores” with populations between
25,000 and 50,000 of Census-defined blocks with
adjacent densely settled surrounding areas).
