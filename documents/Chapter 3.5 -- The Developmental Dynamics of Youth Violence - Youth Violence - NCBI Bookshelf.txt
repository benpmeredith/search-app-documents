This chapter looks closely at childhood andadolescence as critical periods of development to trace how violence unfolds -- its onset,duration, and continuity into adulthood. It also examines violence in relation to other riskybehaviors that emerge in adolescence.The dynamics of youth violence are best understood from a developmental perspective, whichrecognizes that patterns of behavior change over the life course. Adolescence is a time oftumultuous change and vulnerability, which can include an increase in the frequency and meansof expression of violence and other risky behaviors. Understanding when and under whatcircumstances violent behavior typically occurs helps researchers craft interventions that targetthose critical points in development.Our understanding of developmental patterns depends in large part on longitudinal studies, whichtrack the same group of individuals over long periods of time, sometimes a decade or more. Fourmajor longitudinal studies are described in this chapter. They add new dimensions to thesurveillance statistics presented in Chapter 2, and they provide essential background for Chapter4, which deals with why young people become involved in violence.Early- and Late-Onset TrajectoriesLongitudinal research has detected two prominent developmental trajectories for the emergenceof youth violence, one characterized by an early onset of violence and one by a late onset.Children who commit their first serious violent act before puberty are in the early-onset group,whereas youths who do not become violent until adolesence are in the late-onset group. Whileother developmental trajectories have been identified (D'Unger et al., 1998; Nagin & Tremblay,1999), this report focuses on the early- and late-onset trajectories because they are recognized bymost researchers, they debunk the myth that all serious violent offenders can be identified inearly childhood, and they have strikingly different implications for prevention.In the early-onset trajectory, problem behavior that begins in early childhood gradually escalatesto more violent behavior, culminating in serious violence before adolescence. A child's firstserious violent act may have been officially recorded, or it may have been reported by the childto researchers in a confidential survey. The early-onset group, in contrast to the late-onset group,is characterized by higher rates of offending and more serious offenses in adolescence, as well asby greater persistence of violence from adolescence into adulthood (reviewed in Stattin &Magnusson, 1996, and Tolan & Gorman-Smith, 1998). The National Youth Survey shows thatnearly 13 percent of male adolescents in the early-onset trajectory engaged in violence for two ormore years, compared to only 2.5 percent in the late-onset trajectory (Tolan & Gorman-Smith,1998).Between 20 and 45 percent of boys who are serious violent offenders by age 16 or 17 initiatedtheir violence in childhood (D'Unger et al., 1998; Elliott et al., 1986; Huizinga et al., 1995; Nagin
& Tremblay, 1999; Patterson & Yoerger, 1997; Stattin & Magnusson, 1996). A higher percentageof girls who were serious violent offenders by age 16 or 17 (45 to 69 percent) were violent inchildhood (Elliott et al., 1986; Huizinga et al., 1995). This means that most violent youths begin1their violent behavior during adolescence. However, the youths who commit most of the violentacts, who commit the most serious violent acts, and who continue their violent behavior beyondadolescence begin during childhood (Loeber et al., 1998; Moffitt, 1993; Tolan, 1987; Tolan &Gorman-Smith, 1998).makes friends with other children known to be unruly or aggressive consistently does not listen to adults not sensitive to the feelings of others The greater prevalence of late-onset youth violence refutes the myth that all serious violentoffenders can be identified in early childhood. In fact, the majority of young people who becomeviolent show little or no evidence of childhood behavioral disorders, high levels of aggression, orproblem behaviors -- all predictors of later violence.The implications of these findings for prevention are clear: Programs are needed to address bothearly- and late-onset violence. Targeting prevention programs solely to younger children withproblem behavior misses over half of the children who will eventually become serious violentoffenders, although universal prevention programs in childhood may be effective in preventinglate-onset violence (see Chapters 4 and 6).Onset and Prevalence of Serious ViolenceMuch of what is known about the onset, prevalence, and other characteristics of serious violenceduring the adolescent years comes from four important longitudinal surveys. The only nationallyrepresentative one is the National Youth Survey (NYS), an ongoing study of 1,725 youths age 11to 17 in 1976, when the survey began (Elliott, 1994). These youths have been tracked byresearchers for more than two decades and through nine waves, or points at which they wereinterviewed and/or their official records were sought to corroborate self-reported violence.2The other three longitudinal studies cited here are city surveys sponsored by the U.S. Office ofJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and the National Institutes of Health (Huizinga etal., 1995; Thornberry et al., 1995). Beginning in 1988, three teams of researchers began to3interview 4,500 youths age 7 to 15 in three cities -- Denver, Pittsburgh, and Rochester (NewYork). These youths were monitored at different points from 1988 to 1994. Each sampledisproportionately represents youths at high risk of delinquency to ensure that it is large enoughto draw valid conclusions about delinquency and violence, but each also uses weightingprocedures to yield locally representative estimates. The estimates presented here are based onweighted data.These four surveys define serious violence as aggravated assault, robbery, gang fights, or rape;an individual is labeled a serious violent offender if he or she reports committing any one ormore of these offenses. Gang fights are included because follow-up information on these fights4reveals that most of them involve injury serious enough to require medical attention (Elliott,1994).Only the NYS reports the hazard rate for serious violence during the first two decades of life.5The hazard rate is the proportion of persons who initiate serious violence at a given age. Seriousviolence begins mostly between the ages of 12 and 20 (Figure 3-1). In fact, 85 percent of peoplewho become involved in serious violence by age 27 report that their first act occurred betweenage 12 and 20. The onset of serious violence is negligible after age 23 and before age 10 (only
0.2 percent of arrests for serious violent crime in 1997 involved a child under age 10 [Maguire &Pastore, 1999]).          Figure          Figure 3-1. Hazard rate for initiating serious violence, by age,          National Youth Survey. Source: Elliott, 1994. 95%            confidence intervals are all less than (more...)The peak age of onset is 16, when about 5 percent of male adolescents report their first act ofserious violence. The age of onset peaks somewhat later for white males (age 18) than forAfrican American males (age 15). The hazard rate at the peak age also varies somewhat byrace/ethnicity. It is lower for white males (5 percent) than for African American males (8percent) (Elliott, 2000a). A similar finding is reported in the Pittsburgh Youth Survey (Huizingaet al., 1995). No comparable hazard rates have been published for female youths, but other6studies have found that they are generally lower.7Age-specific prevalence -- that is, the proportion of youths at any given age who report havingcommitted at least one serious violent act -- is also greatest in the second decade of life. TheNYS and the three city surveys find that, broadly speaking, age-specific prevalence among maleyouths ranges from about 8 to 20 percent between the ages of 12 and 20 (Figure 3-2). Amongfemales, it ranges from 1 to 18 percent (Table 3-1). There is some variability across surveys,however. In general, the NYS has lower rates than the three city surveys, reflecting the differencebetween a national sample and local samples drawn from urban areas. The differences may alsoreflect the timing of the studies. NYS estimates cover the years 1976 to 1986, whereas the threecity surveys cover the years 1986 or 1988 to 1994, the peak years of the violence epidemic (seeChapter 2). Nevertheless, the estimates for age 17 across these longitudinal surveys are in thesame range as those for high school seniors in the Monitoring the Future survey (see Chapter 2).          Figure          Figure 3-2. Prevalence of serious violence among male          youths, by age: four longitudinal surveys. Sources: Denver          Youth Survey (DYS), Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS),          Rochester Youth (more...)          Table          Table 3-1. Prevalence of serious violence by age, sex, and            race/ethnicity: four longitudinal surveys.Another key difference between the national and city surveys is the maturation effect, or the ageat which serious violence begins to decline sharply during the transition to adulthood. The NYSshows a decline in age-specific prevalence starting in the late teen years and a steep drop-off byage 20. In contrast, the city surveys, which were begun more recently, do not show a decline inthe late teen years (Huizinga et al., 1995), and they have not yet published data on prevalence inearly adulthood. Therefore, it is too soon to tell whether or at what age more recent groups ofyouths will mature out of violence. It is possible that young people are staying violent longer.
Some important differences in age-specific prevalence by sex have emerged from the data (Table3-1). Female adolescents have lower rates of serious violence throughout the second decade. Forthe NYS and Denver surveys, rates at age 12 are about twice as high for boys as for girls.Between age 12 and 15 in Rochester, the rates are fairly similar. For all studies, the rates forfemales at age 17 are about one-quarter the rates for males. In addition, the peak age of seriousviolent offending occurs a few years earlier among females, and their maturation out of seriousviolence is both earlier and steeper than males'.Age-specific prevalence also varies by race/ethnicity (Table 3-1). The NYS finds a significantracial gap between ages 14 and 17, when rates for African American youths are 36 to 50 percenthigher than those for white youths. The city surveys show an even wider gap between AfricanAmerican and white youths (Huizinga et al., 1995). Rates among Hispanic youths, reported onlyfor Denver and Rochester, are similar to or lower than those reported by African Americanyouths in these cities. The prevalence reported by Hispanic youths ranges from 6 to 12 percent inDenver and about 10 to 20 percent in Rochester. Possible reasons for developmental differencesby sex, race, and ethnicity are discussed in Chapter 4. None of these comparisons takes intoaccount the effects of poverty, education, housing, or other environmental conditions.Cumulative PrevalenceCumulative prevalence refers to the proportion of youths at any particular age who have evercommitted a serious violent offense. As a measure of violence, it tends to equalize rather than8magnify differences across populations because it counts youths only once, regardless of when orhow often they engaged in violent acts.The most striking feature of the cumulative prevalence is its sheer magnitude: About 30 to 40percent of male and 16 to 32 percent of female youths have committed a serious violent offenseby age 17 (Figure 3-3). Although these rates are only slightly higher than those found ininternational studies, the represent a more serious set of offenses (Junger-Tas et al., 1994).          Figure          Figure 3-3. Cumulative prevalence of serious violence, by          age, sex, and race: four longitudinal surveys. Sources:          National Youth Survey (NYS), 1976-1993 (Elliott, 1994);          Rochester Youth (more...)The cumulative prevalence of youth violence is generally consistent across the four surveys. Formale youths, the NYS shows it rising to about 40 percent and then leveling off beyond age 22. Inthe city surveys, it reaches more than 40 percent of male and 32 percent of female youths by age17. Not only is the rise in cumulative prevalence by age 17 steeper in the city surveys, themagnitude is substantially higher.These differences between a nationally representative sample and city samples are to beexpected. The timing of the surveys may also explain some of the differences. For example, 17-year-olds in the NYS were interviewed at some point between 1976 and 1982, whereas 17-year-olds in the city surveys were interviewed at some point between 1988 and 1994, the era duringwhich the self-reported prevalence of serious youth violence increased somewhat (see Chapter2).
There is a pronounced difference in cumulative prevalence by sex. Among 17-year-olds, theDenver survey found a cumulative prevalence of 16 percent for female youths and 43 percent formale youths, whereas the Rochester survey showed 32 percent and 40 percent, respectively. Dataon cumulative prevalence for females are not available in the Pittsburgh survey or the NYS.9On the other hand, there are few differences in cumulative prevalence by race over the teenyears, according to the NYS. By age 23, white males had a cumulative prevalence of 38 percentand African American males had a cumulative prevalence of 45 percent, a difference that is notstatistically significant (Figure 3-3).Rates of Offending and Violent CareersViolent youths commit a remarkably high number of crimes (Tolan & Gorman-Smith, 1998). Ananalysis of NYS data shows that these young people (both male and female) averaged 15.6 rapes,robberies, aggravated assaults, or some combination of these crimes over a 16-year period (1976to 1992) (Elliott, 2000b). What's more, they averaged just over six serious violent offenses eachduring the years in which they were active (Elliott, 2000b). This mean annual rate of offending10is similar to rates reported in the three city surveys for males (about 5 to 9 serious violentoffenses per year) (Huizinga et al., 1995) but much higher than the rates for females (2 to 4.5 peryear).It is noteworthy that the mean annual rate of individual offending appears to be essentiallyunchanged over the past two decades. This finding is corroborated by a study of trends amongjuvenile offenders processed by a county court system in Arizona (Snyder, 1998) and by ananalysis of both National Crime Victimization Survey data and arrest records (Snyder &Sickmund, 2000). Finally, the Monitoring the Future survey (see Chapter 2) found no significantchanges in individual offending rates for robbery or assault with injury between 1983 and1993.11Career length has been variously defined as the number of years of active offending, themaximum number of consecutive years, or the span between the first and last year during whicha young person meets the criteria for a serious violent offender (Blumstein et al., 1986). Thereare relatively few estimates of violent career lengths. In the NYS, the mean career length(number of years of active violent offending) was 2.6 years. The most frequent career length was1 year (36.8 percent of serious violent offenders). Three-quarters of these serious violent youthshad careers lasting 3 years or less, and 15 percent had careers of 5 years or more (Elliott, 2000b).Based on 5 years of data, the Denver survey reports that 42 percent of serious violent youthswere active for only 1 year, 22 percent for 2 years, and 31 percent for 3 or more years (Huizingaet al., 1995).The typical violent career comprises either a single year of continuous offending or a longerperiod of intermittent offending. Relatively few violent careers are characterized by years ofuninterrupted violence. In Denver, well over half of the careers that lasted three or more yearshad at least one year with no violent offending; three-quarters of those that spanned a 5-yearperiod had an intermittent pattern of offending (Thornberry et al., 1995). Evidence that mostcareers lasting more than 1 year were characterized by intermittent offending also surfaced in theNYS (Elliott et al., 1986). This intermittent pattern makes it difficult to identify serious violentoffenders with cross-sectional studies or with longitudinal studies that have long periods between
data collection (Huizinga et al., 1995).In sum, these studies suggest that in most cases violent careers are relatively short and arecharacterized by intermittent offending. During active periods, however, most careers are markedby a high rate of violent offending -- up to 10 offenses per year (Elliott et al., 1986; Thornberryet al., 1995).Developmental Pathway to ViolenceViolent youths do not usually begin their careers with a serious violent offense. While thedevelopmental pathway varies, depending on what types of behavior are monitored, studiesgenerally agree that a violent career begins with relatively minor forms of antisocial ordelinquent behavior. These acts later increase in frequency, seriousness, and variety, oftenprogressing to serious violent behavior (Elliott, 1994; Loeber et al., 1998; Moffitt, 1993; Tolan &Gorman-Smith, 1998). Several complex pathways to serious violence have been proposed(Loeber, 1996; Elliott, 1994).The NYS suggests that violence escalates over time. Most serious violent youths who engage inmultiple types of violent behavior begin with aggravated assault, then add a robbery, and finallya rape. (Rape appears to be the endpoint of the progression, although there were not enoughhomicides in the NYS sample to include homicide in the analysis.) Robbery precedes rape inover 70 percent of cases in which both acts have been reported, and about 15 percent of seriousviolent offenders in the NYS reported having committed a rape (Elliott, 1994, 2000a). Thissequence must be considered tentative because it is based on a single study.When serious violence becomes part of a youth's repertoire of antisocial behavior, it does notsubstitute for less serious forms of violence; rather, it adds to them and escalates the overallfrequency of violent acts. Thus, serious violent youths are high-frequency offenders who areinvolved in many less serious as well as serious offenses. These youths account for a major shareof all criminal behavior, a pattern that is explored more fully in the next section.Chronic Violent OffendersA minority of serious violent youths are responsible for the overwhelming majority of seriousviolent crime, a finding supported by numerous self-report and arrest studies (Tolan & Gorman-Smith, 1998; Tracy & Kempf-Leonard, 1996). In the city surveys, chronic offenders, thoughrepresenting less than 20 percent of all serious violent offenders, accounted for 75 to 80 percentof self-reported violent crimes (Huizinga et al., 1995). NYS data yield similar findings: Chronicoffenders (youths with three or more violent offenses) accounted for 76 percent of all felonyassaults and 89 percent of all robberies reported by offenders in 1980 (Elliott et al., 1989).Chronic violent youths may also account for a disproportionate share of all youth crime. TheNYS reveals that in 1980 these serious violent offenders accounted for 79 percent of all felonytheft, 66 percent of all illegal services (primarily drug selling), and 50 percent of all self-reportedcrime (Elliott et al., 1989). In the Philadelphia Birth Cohort Study, 15 percent of youthfuloffenders accounted for 74 percent of all official crime (Tracy & Kempf-Leonard, 1996).As noted earlier, youths whose violence begins before puberty are more likely to become chronicviolent offenders (Loeber et al., 1998). In the Rochester survey, 39 percent of children whoinitiated violent behavior by age 9 eventually became chronic offenders, 30 percent of those who
initiated violence between the ages of 10 and 12 became chronic offenders, and 23 percent ofthose who initiated violence after age 13 became chronic violent offenders. In Denver, 62 percentof those initiating violence by age 9 and 48 percent of those initiating violence between 10 and12 became chronic violent offenders. Looking at this another way, 55 percent of all chronicviolent offenders in Denver came from the early-onset trajectory (Thornberry et al., 1995). Whilethe late-onset trajectory involves a substantially larger group of youths, fewer than half of allchronic offenders come from this group.Although most chronic violent offenders in the three city surveys (62 to 77 percent) eventuallyhad contact with the police for some offense (though not necessarily a violent offense), one-quarter to one-third were never arrested (Huizinga et al., 1995). Among those who were arrestedfor some offense, the first contact came well after they had begun their violent careers.Interventions by the justice system occur too late to prevent such youths from escalating fromless serious offenses to serious violence. Fortunately, it appears that at least half of chronicviolent offenders can be identified as being at risk in childhood.Research has found a powerful relationship between membership in a gang and chronicinvolvement in serious violence (see review in Thornberry, 1998). As noted earlier (see Chapter2), gang members, a relatively small proportion of the adolescent population, commit themajority of serious youth violence (see Spergel, 1990, and Thornberry, 1998, for reviews).Superpredators?Between 1983 and 1993, adolescents were committing homicide at dramatically higher rates thanin previous years (see Chapter 2). Did those youths represent a new breed of frequent, vicious,remorseless killers? Did the character of violent youths change during that time -- and is it stilldifferent today (Bennett et al., 1996)? The answer seems to be no, for several reasons.First, the increase in homicides was similar across all age groups (see Chapter 2). This suggeststhat it resulted from a relatively sudden change in the environment that affected all youths ratherthan from a gradual change in the socialization process, which would have led to progressivelymore vicious youths with each succeeding age group. Second, the increase in homicides washighly specific to certain youths -- namely, African American males (Zimring, 1998); moreover,it did not take place among females (see Chapter 2). Third, during the violence epidemic, therewas a decline in family members killed by youths (Cook & Laub, 1998).Fourth, a new breed of superpredators should have resulted in more burglaries, auto thefts, andlarcenies, but no such increases occurred (Cook & Laub, 1998). It should also have resulted inmore homicides involving knives and other weapons, but this did not occur (Zimring, 1998).Fifth, there was no evidence that individual rates of serious violent crime changed during theepidemic. More youths were involved, but the average number of offenses committed by eachdid not change. Finally, there may be anecdotal evidence that today's youths show less remorsefor their violence, but this has not been substantiated by research.In sum, the epidemic of violence from 1983 to 1993 does not seem to have resulted from a basicchange in the offending rates and viciousness of young offenders. Rather, it resulted primarilyfrom a relatively sudden change in the social environment -- the introduction of guns into violentexchanges among youths. The violence epidemic was, in essence, the result of a change in thepresence and type of weapon used, which increased the lethality of violent incidents (Wintemute,
2000).Co-occurring Problem BehaviorsSerious violence is accompanied by a wide range of other problem behaviors, including propertycrimes, substance use, gun ownership, dropping out of school, early sexual activity, and recklessdriving. The co-occurrence of these problem behaviors has been borne out by numerous nationaland local studies (see reviews in Elliott, 1993; Huizinga & Jakob-Chen, 1998; Tolan & Gorman-Smith, 1998).The overlap is greatest between serious violence and other forms of crime. In the three citysurveys, 82 to 92 percent of chronic violent youths were involved in property crimes, 71 to 82percent in public disorder crimes, and 26 to 45 percent in selling drugs (Huizinga et al., 1995).Very similar rates were found in the NYS (Elliott et al., 1989). Rates of co-occurrence weremuch higher among serious violent youths than among less violent youths.Substance use and abuse are a central feature of a violent lifestyle (Dembo et al., 1991; Elliott,1994; Elliott et al., 1989; Esbensen & Huizinga, 1991; Fagan, 1993; Johnson et al., 1991). In theDenver survey, for example, about 58 percent of serious violent offenders were alcohol users and34 percent were marijuana users. The prevalence and frequency of use were much lower inyouths who were not seriously violent (Huizinga & Jakob-Chen, 1998). The NYS indicates that94 percent of serious violent youths in 1980 were using alcohol, 85 percent were usingmarijuana, and 55 percent were using several illicit drugs. Over half (55 percent) were abusingdrugs -- that is, they reported health or relationship problems, or both, associated with their druguse (Elliott et al., 1989).Similar findings regarding the overlap of substance use and serious violence hold for theRochester study (Thornberry et al., 1995). Moreover, chronic violent youths in Rochester andviolent youths in the NYS had higher rates of dropping out of school, gun ownership and use,teenage sexual activity and parenthood, tobacco use, driving under the influence of alcohol ordrugs, and gang membership than nonserious offenders or nonoffenders (Elliott, 1993;Thornberry et al., 1995).In sum, these studies show that a sizable proportion of serious violent youths have co-occurringproblem behaviors -- and at rates significantly higher than those of their less violent counterparts.However, by no means all serious violent youths or even all chronic violent youths have co-occurring problems. Moreover, not all youths with problem behaviors are seriously violent. Thefact that serious violence and problem behaviors tend to occur together does not necessarilymean that one causes the other (see Chapter 4) (Elliott, 1993; Reiss & Roth, 1993).Violence and Mental HealthThe relationship between violence and mental health has been studied more intensively in adultsthan in young people. An earlier U.S. Surgeon General's report on mental health, after weighingthe evidence, emphasized that the contribution of mental disorders to overall violence in theUnited States is very small. In fact, public fear is out of proportion to the actual risk of violence,which contributes to the stigmatizing of people with severe mental disorders (Link et al., 1999).Even though the risk of violence is low overall, it is greatest for adults with serious mentaldisorders who also abuse substances (Steadman et al., 1998; Swanson, 1994).
Although violence is relatively widespread among adolescents, few studies have been undertakenon the co-occurrence of violence and mental health problems or disorders among U.S.adolescents. Such population-based studies are important because they avoid the bias inherent insurveying hospitalized patients or convicted offenders.Both the NYS and the Denver survey examine the co-occurrence of serious violence and mentalhealth problems. In the NYS, 28 percent of serious offenders age 11 to 17 were classified ashaving mental health problems, compared to 13 to 14 percent of nonserious delinquent youthsand 9 percent of nonoffenders. Youths were classified as having mental health problems on thebasis of their responses to questions about emotional problems, social isolation, and feelings ofloneliness (Elliott et al., 1989). (The questions were not designed to arrive at a diagnosis of amental disorder.) Serious violent offenders were more likely than either nonserious offenders ornonoffenders to report having these types of mental health problems.In the Denver study, serious violent youths were found to have higher rates of psychologicalproblems, based on parents' responses to the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach & Edelbrock,1983). These problems included externalizing and internalizing behavior, depression,uncommunicativeness, obsessive-compulsive behavior, hyperactivity, social withdrawal, andaggressiveness. The rates at which most of these problems occurred in serious offenders were nodifferent from the rates at which they occurred in nonviolent delinquent youths; however, rates innondelinquent youths were lower. Thus, delinquent youths in general were more likely to havepsychological problems than nondelinquent youths (Huizinga & Jakob-Chen, 1998).Two problems were linked directly to violent behavior -- externalizing symptoms and aggressivebehavior. Approximately half of all serious violent offenders display these problems, althoughthe link with externalizing behaviors is statistically significant only for boys. In addition, parentsof violent offenders report seeking help for mental health problems more often than parents ofnondelinquent or nonviolent delinquent youths. These parents did not go to mental healthprofessionals or school counselors; rather, they sought the advice of friends, relatives, andspiritual leaders (ministers, rabbis, or priests). A similar finding is reported in the Pittsburghstudy (Stouthamer-Loeber & Thomas, 1992).The Denver study found no differences between the self-esteem of serious violent offenders andnonviolent offenders or nonoffenders (Huizinga & Jakob-Chen, 1998). In general, there is littleevidence that low self-esteem causes violence or that violent offenders have low self-esteem. Onthe contrary, the evidence is more consistent with the position that high self-esteem and threats tohigh esteem lead to violence (Baumeister et al., 1996). This has important implications fortreatment and intervention programs and the use of esteem-building activities in these programs.A population-based study in New Zealand found that in young adulthood (age 21), seriousviolent offenders are more likely than nonoffenders to exhibit substance dependence disorders,schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, or both (Arseneault et al., 2000). These New Zealand12findings are consistent with the studies of U.S. adults showing that the greatest risk of violencestems from the combination of serious mental disorder and substance dependence. However,about 10 percent of serious violent offenders in the New Zealand study exhibited13schizophrenia-spectrum disorders without substance dependence or other psychiatric conditions.The researchers concluded that while the contribution of serious mental illness to violence inyoung adults remains small, it may be slightly higher than it is in adults. One possible reason for
the difference is that the overwhelming majority of young adults with mental disorders in theNew Zealand study had not been treated or hospitalized within the previous year.Another recent community-based study found a link between personality disorders (a group ofsevere mental disorders) and violence. Adolescents with personality disorders, as determined14by diagnostic interviews, were more likely than other adolescents to commit violent acts such asassault with injury and robbery (Johnson et al., 2000). For example, about 36 percent ofadolescents with personality disorders versus 16 percent without the disorders committed aviolent act against others during adolescence. The relationship between personality disorders15and violence remained after taking many factors into account, including co-occurring depression,anxiety, and substance disorders. Only a few adolescents (13 percent) with personality disordershad received mental health services during the previous year (Johnston, personal communication,2000).Thus, there is some evidence of a relationship between serious mental disorders and violence inadolescents or young adults in the general population. Young people with serious mentaldisorders may be at risk of becoming violent if they also abuse substances or if they have notreceived treatment for their mental disorder. More research is needed to understand therelationship between serious youth violence and mental illness.Offending and VictimizationViolent offenders are frequently victims of violence (Esbensen & Huizinga, 1991; Lauritsen etal., 1991; Sampson & Lauritsen, 1990, 1994). Data from the NYS reveal that victimization ishighest among African Americans, males, and frequent offenders (Lauritsen et al., 1991). Inaddition, youths who report abusing drugs and alcohol, hanging out with delinquent peers, andparticipating in social activities with little adult supervision are at greater risk of being victims ofviolence (Gottfredson, 1984; Lauritsen et al., 1991; Sampson & Lauritsen, 1990). A delinquentlifestyle greatly increases the likelihood of being a victim and appears to account for some of thedisparities observed in offending and victimization by race/ethnicity and sex. The Denver surveyshows that 42 percent of serious violent offenders are also victims of violence (Huizinga &Jakob-Chen, 1998), with higher rates among male offenders than female offenders.There are many reasons for the overlap between offending and victimization. Perhaps the mostcommon is that the offender is injured by the intended target -- either during the offense or later,in retaliation. Another reason is that offenders tend to live in more violent environments or theirlifestyles take them into high-risk environments. The predictive relationship betweenvictimization and offending, as well as the relationship with early child abuse, is discussed inChapter 4.Transition to AdulthoodThe transition from adolescence to adulthood features a fairly abrupt discontinuation of seriousviolence, at least according to the NYS. Rates of onset and age-specific prevalence showdramatic declines, and the cumulative prevalence levels off, as discussed above. Only about 20percent of serious violent offenders continue their violent careers into their twenties (Elliott,1994).While there are no differences by sex in the apparent termination of violent offending, there are
significant differences by race. Twice as many African American as white youths continue theirviolent behavior into the adult years (Elliott, 1994). Preliminary analyses suggest that cessationof offending is related to having a stable job and a stable intimate relationship.By 1992, the most recent year for which data are available, many people monitored by the NYShad reached their late twenties and early thirties. There is virtually no published informationabout what patterns of violence may have continued into their adult years. The more recent citysurveys have published age-specific and cumulative prevalence findings only up to age 19, butthese studies are still being conducted. Some evidence from these surveys (Figure 3-2) suggeststhat violent careers are lasting longer, but additional waves of data are needed to verify this trend.Understanding the demographics and dynamics of how patterns of serious violence change withthe transition into adulthood is critical to designing programs that enhance the termination ofviolence.ConclusionsThe prevalence of serious violence by age 17 is startling. About 30 to 40 percent of male and 15to 30 percent of female youths report having committed a serious violent offense at some point intheir lives. This cumulative prevalence is similar among African American and white males, incontrast to other measures of violence, which show racial disparities (see Chapter 2).Two general onset trajectories emerge from longitudinal studies of youth violence -- an early-onset trajectory that begins before puberty and a late-onset one that begins in adolescence.Youths in the early-onset trajectory generally commit more crimes, and more serious crimes, fora longer time. These young people exhibit a pattern of escalating violence through childhood andadolescence, and frequently into adulthood.Most youths who become violent, however, begin in adolescence. Their late-onset offending isusually limited to a short period, peaking at about age 16 and dropping off dramatically by age20. They typically show few signs in childhood that they will become violent later on, laying torest the myth that all violent adolescents can be identified in childhood.The rate of individual offending appears to have remained virtually unchanged, both during andsince the years of the violence epidemic, which began in 1983 and peaked in 1993. This finding,together with evidence that the epidemic was specific to gun-related violence, challenges themyth that the early 1990s produced a generation of superpredators who were more vicious andwho committed dramatically more crimes than earlier generations of young people. At the sametime, the finding of a stable individual offending rate indicates that the violence epidemic has notaltogether subsided.Serious violence is frequently part of a lifestyle that includes drugs, guns, precocious sex, andother risky behaviors. Youths involved in serious violence typically commit many other types ofcrimes and exhibit other problem behaviors, presenting a serious challenge to interventionefforts. Successful interventions must confront not only the violent behavior of these youngpeople, but also their lifestyles, which are teeming with risk.Prevention and intervention programs must also take into account the different patterns ofviolence typical of the early- and late-onset trajectories, as well as the relatively constant rates ofindividual offending. Early childhood programs that target at-risk children and families are
critical for preventing the onset of a chronic violent career, but programs must also be developedto combat late-onset violence. The importance of late-onset violence prevention is neither widelyrecognized nor well understood. Substantial numbers of serious violent offenders emergeseemingly without warning. A comprehensive community prevention strategy must address bothonset patterns and ferret out their respective causes and risk factors.References1. Achenbach, T.M & Edelbrock, C.

long enough to provide descriptions of developmental trajectories in adolescence.3Confidence intervals for all four surveys are based on simple binomial distributions and do not reflect thefull sampling designs of these studies.4In each survey, follow-up questions were asked to determine the seriousness and appropriateness of thereported event. Reports of nonserious events were not included. This adjustment could not be made for thefirst 3 years of the NYS, so for those years at least two serious violent offenses were required for a youth tobe classified as a serious violent offender.5The rates for age 10 and under are based entirely upon retrospective reports and may not be as reliable asthose for age 11 and older.6The actual hazard rates are not presented, but the investigators note that the rates were higher for AfricanAmericans between the ages of 12 and 16 (Huizinga et al., 1995).7Using a slightly different definition of serious violent offender (three or more serious violent offenses), thehazard rate for females peaked at age 14 (1.5 percent    1.0 percent) and dropped by age 17 (0.6 percent   0.5 percent) (Elliott et al., 1986).8Cumulative prevalence is also known as lifetime prevalence or ever-prevalence to a given age.9The NYS reports an 11 percent cumulative prevalence at age 21 among females who are chronic(committing three or more offenses per year) serious violent offenders.10Active involvement is defined as any year during which offenders committed one or more serious violentoffenses.11Calculations were done by the senior scientific editor Elliott on the basis of Monitoring the Futureprevalence and frequency data on aggravated assault and robbery contained in the 1991 and 1998Sourcebooks of Criminal Justice Statistics (Flanagan & Maguire, 1992; Maguire & Pastore, 1999).Individual offending rates are based on estimated incident rates. For this calculation, frequenciesassociated with categorical scores were as follows: not at all = 0; once = 1; twice = 2; 3 or 4 times = 3.5;and 5 or more times = 5. Individual offending rates for robbery in both 1983 and 1993 were 1.8. Rates forassault with injury were 2.3 and 2.6 (not significant). The mean individual offending rate can remainrelatively constant despite increases in prevalence and incident rates noted in Chapter 2.12This broad category includes individuals who responded "yes, definitely" when asked if they had positivesymptoms of schizophrenia (hallucinations and delusions) and for whom other plausible explanations(such as major depressive episodes or the influence of alcohol or illicit drugs) could be ruled out. Theclassification of diagnoses was made with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule.13Defined by two or more types of violent offenses (simple assault, aggravated assault, robbery, rape, andgang fighting) or a conviction.14The personality disorders included in this study were the same disorders (e.g., schizotypal disorder)studied by Arseneault et al. (2000).15Included threats to injure others, initiation of physical fights, mugging, robberies, or assaults resulting ininjury during the past 1 to 4 years or during the individual's lifetime. The acts were reported in 1985-1986or 1991-1993.Copyright Notice
