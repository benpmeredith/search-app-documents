EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for teaching and learning, free of crime and
violence. Any instance of crime or violence at school not only affects the individuals
involved but also may disrupt the educational process and affect bystanders, the school
itself, and the surrounding community (Henry 2000).
Ensuring safer schools requires establishing good indicators of the current state of
school crime and safety across the nation and regularly updating and monitoring these
indicators. This is the aim of Indicators of School Crime and Safety.
This report is the tenth in a series of annual publications produced jointly by the
National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Institute of Education Sciences (IES),
in the U.S. Department of Education, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) in the
U.S. Department of Justice. This report presents the most recent data available on
school crime and student safety. The indicators in this report are based on information
drawn from a variety of data sources, including national surveys of students, teachers,
and principals. Such sources include results from a study of violent deaths in
schools, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention; the National Crime Victimization Survey and School Crime
Supplement to the survey, sponsored by the BJS and NCES, respectively; the Youth Risk
Behavior Survey, sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the
Schools and Stafﬁng Survey and School Survey on Crime and Safety, both sponsored
by NCES. The most recent data collection for each indicator varied by survey, from
2003–04 to 2005–06. Each data source has an independent sample design, data
collection method, and questionnaire design or is the result of a universe data
collection. All comparisons described in this report are statistically signiﬁcant at the .05
level. In 2005, the ﬁnal response rate for students age 12 to 18 for the School Crime
Supplement (56 percent),1 fell below the NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret
the 2005 data from Indicators 3, 8, 10, 11, 17, 18, and 21 with caution. Additional
information about methodology and the datasets analyzed in this report may be found
in appendix A.
This report covers topics such as victimization, ﬁghts, bullying, classroom disorder,
weapons, student perceptions of school safety, teacher injury, and availability and
student use of drugs and alcohol. Indicators of crime and safety are compared across
different population subgroups and over time. Data on crimes that occur outside of
school grounds are offered as a point of comparison where available.

Analysis of unit nonresponse found evidence that for some demographic groups, there may be a response
bias in that the nonrespondents have different characteristics than those who responded. Weighting
adjustments, which corrected for differential response rates, should have reduced the problem. Therefore,
while the results are valid, in interpreting the data from Indicators 3, 8, 10, 11, 17, 18, and 21, a reader should
understand that these estimates may have larger and unmeasured sources of survey error than other estimates.

KEY FINDINGS
In the 2005–06 school year, an estimated 54.8 million students were enrolled in
prekindergarten through grade 12 (U.S. Department of Education 2007). Preliminary
data show that among youth ages 5–18, there were 17 school-associated violent
deaths2 from July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2006 (14 homicides and 3 suicides)
(Indicator 1). In 2005, among students ages 12–18, there were about 1.5 million
victims of nonfatal crimes at school,3 including 868,100 thefts4 and 628,200 violent
crimes5 (simple assault and serious violent crime6) (Indicator 2). There is some
evidence that student safety has improved. The victimization rate of students ages
12–18 at school declined between 1992 and 2005 (Indicator 2). However, violence,
theft, drugs, and weapons continue to pose problems in schools. During the 2005–06
school year, 86 percent of public schools reported that at least one violent crime, theft,
or other crime occurred at their school (Indicator 6). In 2005, 8 percent of students in
grades 9–12 reported being threatened or injured with a weapon in the previous 12
months, and 25 percent reported that drugs were made available to them on school
property (Indicators 4 and 9). In the same year, 28 percent of students ages 12–18
reported having been bullied at school during the previous 6 months (Indicator 11).
The following section presents key ﬁndings from each section of the report.

Violent Deaths
•

From July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2006, there were 14 homicides and 3 suicides of
school-age youth (ages 5–18) at school (Indicator 1), or about 1 homicide or suicide
of a school-age youth at school per 3.2 million students enrolled during the 2005–06
school year.

Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization
•

In 2005, students ages 12–18 were victims of about 1.5 million nonfatal crimes at
school, including thefts4 and violent crimes5 (Indicator 2).

•

Students ages 12–18 were generally more likely to be victims of theft4 at school than
away from school (Indicator 2). In 2005, 33 thefts4 per 1,000 students occurred at
school and 23 thefts4 per 1,000 students occurred away from school.

•

In 2005, 4 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being victimized at school during
the previous 6 months: 3 percent reported theft,4 and 1 percent reported violent
victimization5 (Indicator 3). Less than half of a percent of students reported serious
violent victimization.6

2 School-associated violent death is deﬁned as “a homicide, suicide, legal intervention (involving a law
enforcement ofﬁcer), or unintentional ﬁrearm-related death in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus
of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States.” Victims of school-associated violent
deaths included students, staff members, and others who are not students.
3 See appendix B for a detailed deﬁnition of “at school.”
4 Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts except motor vehicle
thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which threat or use of force is involved.
5 Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and simple assault.
6 Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.

•

Between 2003 and 2005, the percentage of students ages 12–18 reporting victimization
declined (from 5 to 4 percent), as did the percentage reporting theft4 (from 4 to 3
percent); there were no measurable changes in the percentages reporting violent5 and
serious violent crime6 during the same period (Indicator 3).

•

In 2005, 10 percent of male students in grades 9–12 reported being threatened or
injured with a weapon on school property in the past year, compared to 6 percent of
female students (Indicator 4).

•

Hispanic students were more likely than White students to report being threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property in 2005 (10 vs. 7 percent) (Indicator 4). However, no
measurable differences were found in the percentages of Black and White students, or Black
and Hispanic students who reported being threatened or injured in this way.

•

In the 2003–04 school year, a greater percentage of teachers in city schools reported
being threatened with injury or physically attacked in 2003–04 than teachers in
suburban, town, or rural schools (Indicator 5). For example, in 2003–04, 10 percent of
teachers in city schools were threatened with injury by students, compared to 6 percent
of teachers in suburban schools, 5 percent of teachers in town schools, and 5 percent
of teachers in rural schools.

•

A greater percentage of secondary school teachers (8 percent) reported being
threatened with injury by a student than elementary school teachers (6 percent)
(Indicator 5). However, a greater percentage of elementary school teachers (4 percent)
reported having been physically attacked than secondary school teachers (2 percent).

•

A greater percentage of public than private school teachers reported being threatened
with injury (7 vs. 2 percent) or physically attacked (4 vs. 2 percent) by students in school
(Indicator 5). Among teachers in city schools, those in public schools were at least ﬁve
times more likely to be threatened with injury than their colleagues in private schools (12
vs. 2 percent) and at least four times more likely to be physically attacked (5 vs. 1 percent).

School Environment
•

In 2005–06, 86 percent of public schools reported one or more serious violent
incidents,7 violent incidents,8 thefts of items valued at $10 or greater, or other crimes
had occurred at their school, amounting to an estimated 2.2 million crimes (Indicator 6).
This ﬁgure translates into a rate of 46 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled in 2005–06.

•

The percentage of public schools experiencing incidents of crime was lower in 2005–
06 than in 2003–04 (Indicator 6). However, the percentage of schools experiencing
crimes in 2005–06 was not measurably different from the percentage of schools
experiencing crimes in 1999–2000.

7

Serious violent incidents include rape or attempted rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or
ﬁght with a weapon, threat of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon. Serious
violent incidents are a subset of violent incidents.
8 Violent incidents include serious violent incidents plus physical attacks or ﬁghts without a weapon and
threats of physical attacks without a weapon. Serious violent incidents are a subset of violent incidents.

•

In 2005–06, 24 percent of public schools reported that student bullying was a daily
or weekly problem (Indicator 7). With regard to other discipline problems occurring
at least once a week, 18 percent of public school principals reported student acts of
disrespect for teachers, 9 percent reported student verbal abuse of teachers, 3 percent
reported daily or weekly occurrences of racial/ethnic tensions among students, and 2
percent reported widespread disorder in classrooms. With regard to other discipline
problems occurring at least once per school year, 17 percent of principals reported
undesirable gang activities and 4 percent reported undesirable cult or extremist
activities during 2005–06.

•

In 2005–06, a higher percentage of middle schools than primary schools reported

the presence of gangs at their school than suburban students (21 percent) and rural
students (16 percent).

•

The percentage of students reporting the presence of gangs increased from 21 to 24 percent
between 2003 and 2005 (Indicator 8). The percentage of students at urban schools reporting
the presence of gangs at school increased from 31 to 36 percent during this period.

•

In 2005, one-quarter of all students in grades 9–12 reported that someone had offered,
sold, or given them an illegal drug on school property in the past 12 months (Indicator 9).

•

Eleven percent of students ages 12–18 reported that someone at school had used haterelated words against them, and more than one-third (38 percent) reported seeing haterelated grafﬁti at school in 2005 (Indicator 10).

•

In 2005, 28 percent of students ages 12–18 reported having been bullied at school

bullying had happened once or twice during that period, 25 percent had experienced
bullying once or twice a month, 11 percent reported having been bullied once or twice
a week, and 8 percent said they had been bullied almost daily.

•

Of those students who reported bullying incidents that involved being pushed,
shoved, tripped, or spit on (9 percent), 24 percent reported that they had sustained an
injury9 during the previous 6 months as a result (Indicator 11). While no measurable
differences were found by sex in students’ likelihood of reporting a bullying incident
in 2005, among students who reported being bullied, males were more likely than
females to report being injured during such an incident (31 vs. 18 percent).

and 88 percent reported that the principal enforced the school rules in 2003–04.

•

A higher percentage of elementary school teachers than secondary school teachers agreed
that school rules were enforced by teachers in their school, even for students not in their
class (Indicator 12). In 2003–04, 79 percent of elementary teachers reported that school
rules were enforced by other teachers, compared to 56 percent of secondary teachers.

Fights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances
•

In 2005, 36 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported they had been in a ﬁght
anywhere, and 14 percent said they had been in a ﬁght on school property during the
previous 12 months (Indicator 13). In the same year, 43 percent of males said they had
been in a ﬁght anywhere, compared to 28 percent of females, and 18 percent of males
said they had been in a ﬁght on school property, compared to 9 percent of females.

•

Nineteen percent of students in grades 9–12 in 2005 reported they had carried a
weapon anywhere, and 6 percent reported they had carried a weapon on school
property during the previous 30 days (Indicator 14). Males were more than two times
more likely than females to carry a weapon—either anywhere or on school property—
in all survey years. In 2005, for example, 10 percent of males carried a weapon on
school property, compared to 3 percent of females, and 30 percent of males carried a
weapon anywhere, compared to 7 percent of females.

•

In 2005, 43 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported having consumed at least one
drink of alcohol anywhere, and 4 percent reported having consumed at least one drink
on school property during the previous 30 days (Indicator 15). Hispanic students (8
percent) were more likely to report using alcohol on school property than White, Black,
or Asian students (4, 3, and 1 percent, respectively).

•

Twenty percent of students in grades 9–12 in 2005 reported using marijuana anywhere
during the past 30 days, and 5 percent reported using marijuana on school property
during this period (Indicator 16). At school, Hispanic students (8 percent) and American
Indian students (9 percent) were more likely to report using marijuana than White or
Black students (4 and 5 percent, respectively).

Fear and Avoidance
•

In 2005, approximately 6 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they were afraid
of attack or harm at school, and 5 percent reported that they were afraid of attack or
harm away from school (Indicator 17). The percentage of students who reported that
they were afraid of being attacked at school (including on the way to and from school)
decreased from 12 to 6 percent between 1995 and 2005.

Executive Summary

....................................................................................

vii

•

Black and Hispanic students were more likely than White students to fear for their
safety regardless of location in 2005 (Indicator 17). Nine percent of Black students
and 10 percent of Hispanic students reported that they were afraid of being attacked
at school (including on the way to and from school), compared to 4 percent of White
students. Away from school, 7 percent of Black students, 6 percent of Hispanic
students, and 4 percent of White students reported that they were afraid of an attack.

•

In 2005, 6 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they had avoided a school
activity or one or more places in school in the previous 6 months because of fear of
attack or harm: 2 percent of students avoided a school activity, and 4 percent avoided
one or more places in school (Indicator 18). Consistent with most previous years,
students in urban areas in 2005 were the most likely to avoid places in school: 6
percent of urban students reported that they had done so, compared to 4 percent of
suburban and rural students.

Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures
•

Forty-eight percent of public schools reported taking at least one serious disciplinary
action against a student—including suspensions lasting 5 days or more, removals with
no services (i.e., expulsions), and transfers to specialized schools—for speciﬁc offenses
during the 2005–06 school year (Indicator 19). Of those serious disciplinary actions,
74 percent were suspensions for 5 days or more, 5 percent were expulsions, and 20
percent were transfers to specialized schools.

•

The largest percentage of schools that reported taking a disciplinary action in 2005–06
did so in response to a physical attack or ﬁght: 32 percent of schools reported taking a
serious disciplinary action for physical attacks or ﬁghts (Indicator 19).

•

In the 2005–06 school year, 5 percent of public schools reported performing drug
testing on athletes and 3 percent reported doing so for students in other extracurricular
activities (Indicator 20). A higher percentage of public high schools than middle or
primary schools reported performing drug tests on students: 13 percent of high schools
reported performing drug tests on athletes, compared to 7 percent of middle schools
and 1 percent of primary schools.

•

The vast majority of students ages 12–18 reported that their school had a student code
of conduct (95 percent) and a requirement that visitors sign in (93 percent) in 2005
(Indicator 21). Metal detectors were the least commonly observed security measure,
with 11 percent of students reporting their use at their school.

FOREWORD
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2007 provides the most recent national
indicators on school crime and safety. Some of these indicators document that student
safety has improved. The victimization rate of students ages 12–18 at school declined
between 1992 and 2005. However, reports of violence, theft, drugs, and weapons did
not decline during this same period. During the 2005–06 school year, 86 percent of
public schools reported that at least one violent crime, theft, or other crime occurred at
their school. In 2005, 8 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported being threatened
or injured with a weapon in the previous 12 months, and 25 percent reported that
drugs were made available to them on school property.
The information presented in this report is intended to serve as a reference for
policymakers and practitioners so that they can develop effective programs and policies
aimed at violence and school crime prevention. Accurate information about the nature,
extent, and scope of the problem being addressed is essential for developing effective
programs and policies.
This is the tenth edition of Indicators of School Crime and Safety, a joint publication
of the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the National Center for Education Statistics
(NCES). This report provides detailed statistics to inform the nation about current
aspects of crime and safety in schools.
The 2007 edition of Indicators includes the most recent available data, compiled
from a number of statistical data sources supported by the federal government. Such
sources include results from a study of violent deaths in schools, sponsored by the
U.S. Department of Education and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;
the National Crime Victimization Survey and School Crime Supplement to the
survey, sponsored by the BJS and NCES, respectively; the Youth Risk Behavior Survey,
sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the Schools and
Stafﬁng Survey and School Survey on Crime and Safety, both sponsored by NCES.
The entire report is available on the Internet. The Bureau of Justice Statistics and the
National Center for Education Statistics continue to work together in order to provide
timely and complete data on the issues of school-related violence and safety.

INTRODUCTION
Our nation’s schools should be a safe haven for teaching and learning free of crime
and violence. Even though students are less likely to be victims of a violent crime at
school1 than away from school (Indicators 1 and 2), any instance of crime or violence
at school not only affects the individuals involved but also may disrupt the educational
process and affect bystanders, the school itself, and the surrounding community
(Henry 2000). For both students and teachers, victimization at school can have lasting
effects. In addition to experiencing loneliness, depression, and adjustment difﬁculties
(Crick and Bigbee 1998; Crick and Grotpeter 1996; Nansel et al. 2001; Prinstein,
Boergers, and Vernberg 2001; Storch et al. 2003), victimized children are more
prone to truancy (Ringwalt, Ennett, and Johnson 2003), poor academic performance
(Wei and Williams 2004), dropping out of school (Beauvais et al. 1996), and violent
behaviors (Nansel et al. 2003). For teachers, incidents of victimization may lead
to professional disenchantment and even departure from the profession altogether
(Karcher 2002).
For parents, school staff, and policymakers to effectively address school crime, they
need an accurate understanding of the extent, nature, and context of the problem.
However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the scope of crime and violence in schools given the
large amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of extreme school violence.
Measuring progress toward safer schools requires establishing good indicators of the
current state of school crime and safety across the nation and regularly updating and
monitoring these indicators; this is the aim of Indicators of School Crime and Safety.

PURPOSE

AND

ORGANIZATION

OF THIS

REPORT

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2007 is the tenth in a series of reports produced
by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS) since 1998 that present the most recent data available on school crime
and student safety. The report is not intended to be an exhaustive compilation of school
crime and safety information, nor does it attempt to explore reasons for crime and
violence in schools. Rather, it is designed to provide a brief summary of information
from an array of data sources and to make data on national school crime and safety
accessible to policymakers, educators, parents, and the general public.
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2007 is organized into sections that delineate
speciﬁc concerns to readers, starting with a description of the most serious violent
crimes. The sections cover Violent Deaths; Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization;
School Environment; Fights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances; Fear and Avoidance;
and Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures. Each section contains a set of indicators
that, taken together, aim to describe a distinct aspect of school crime and safety. Where
available, data on crimes that occur outside of school grounds are offered as a point of

comparison.2 Supplemental tables for each indicator provide more detailed breakouts
and standard errors for estimates. A glossary of terms and references section appear at
the end of the report.
This year’s report contains updated data on violent deaths (Indicator 1), nonfatal
student victimization (Indicator 2), public school reports of selected crimes (Indicator
6), discipline problems (Indicator 7), serious disciplinary actions (Indicator 19), and
safety and security measures (Indicator 20). A new classiﬁcation scheme for school
level has been applied to the most recent data available on teachers who were
threatened with injury or physically attacked in Indicator 5. In addition, one new
indicator appears in this year’s report: Indicator 12 summarizes teachers’ reports of the
conditions at their schools, including student misbehavior, tardiness, and class cutting
and school rule enforcement by other teachers and principals.
Also found in this year’s report are references to recent publications relevant to each
indicator that the reader may want to consult for additional information or analyses.
These references can be found in the “For more information” sidebars at the bottom of
each indicator.

DATA
The indicators in this report are based on information drawn from a variety of
independent data sources, including national surveys of students, teachers, and
principals and universe data collections from federal departments and agencies,
including BJS, NCES, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Each data source has an independent sample design, data
collection method, and questionnaire design or is the result of a universe data
collection.
The combination of multiple, independent sources of data provides a broad perspective
on school crime and safety that could not be achieved through any single source of
information. However, readers should be cautious when comparing data from different
sources. While every effort has been made to keep key deﬁnitions consistent across
indicators, differences in sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and question
phrasing can all affect the comparability of results. For example, both Indicators 20
and 21 report data on select security and safety measures used in schools. Indicator
20 uses data collected from a sample of principals about safety and security practices
used in their schools during the 2005–06 school year. Indicator 21, however, uses data
collected from 12- through 18-year-olds residing in a sample of households. These
students were asked whether they observed selected safety and security measures in
their school in 2005, but they may not have known if, in fact, the security measure was
present. In addition, different indicators contain various approaches to the analysis of
school crime data and, therefore, will show different perspectives on school crime. For
example, both Indicators 2 and 3 report data on theft and violent crime at school
2 Data in this report are not adjusted to reﬂect the number of hours that youths spend on school property
versus the number of hours they spend elsewhere.

based on the National Crime Victimization Survey and the School Crime Supplement
to that survey, respectively. While Indicator 2 examines the number of incidents of
crime, Indicator 3 examines the percentage or prevalence of students who reported
victimization. Figure A provides a summary of some of the variations in the design and
coverage of sample surveys used in this report.
Several indicators in this report are based on self-reported survey data. Readers
should note that limitations inherent to self-reported data may affect estimates (Cantor
and Lynch 2000). First, unless an interview is “bounded” or a reference period is
established, estimates may include events that exceed the scope of the speciﬁed
reference period. This factor may artiﬁcially increase reports because respondents may
recall events outside of the given reference period. Second, many of the surveys rely
on the respondent to “self-determine” a condition. This factor allows the respondent
to deﬁne a situation based upon his or her own interpretation of whether the incident
was a crime or not. On the other hand, the same situation may not necessarily be
interpreted in the same way by a bystander or the perceived offender. Third, victim
surveys tend to emphasize crime events as incidents that take place at one point in
time. However, victims can often experience a state of victimization in which they
are threatened or victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally, respondents may recall

an event inaccurately. For instance, people may forget the event entirely or recall the
speciﬁcs of the episode incorrectly. These and other factors may affect the precision of
the estimates based on these surveys.
Data trends are discussed in this report when possible. Where trends are not discussed,
either the data are not available in earlier surveys or the wording of the survey question
changed from year to year, eliminating the ability to discuss any trend. Where data
from samples are reported, as is the case with most of the indicators in this report,
the standard error is calculated for each estimate provided in order to determine the
“margin of error” for these estimates. The standard errors of the estimates for different
subpopulations in an indicator can vary considerably and should be taken into account
when making comparisons. Throughout this report, in cases where the standard error
was at least 30 percent of the associated estimate, the estimates were noted with a “!”
symbol (interpret data with caution). In cases where the standard error was greater than
50 percent of the associated estimate, the estimate was suppressed. See appendix A for
more information.
The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical signiﬁcance to ensure that
the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Unless
otherwise noted, all statements cited in the report are statistically signiﬁcant at the
.05 level. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being
analyzed and the nature of the statement being tested. The primary test procedure
used in this report was the Student’s t statistic, which tests the difference between two
sample estimates. Linear trend tests were used when differences among percentages
were examined relative to ordered categories of a variable, rather than the differences
between two discrete categories. This test allows one to examine whether, for example,
the percentage of students who reported using drugs increased (or decreased) over
time or whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in
school increased (or decreased) with age. When differences among percentages were
examined relative to a variable with ordered categories (such as grade), analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables.
Appendix A of this report contains descriptions of all the datasets used in this report
and a discussion of how standard errors were calculated for each estimate.

VIOLENT
DEATHS

Indicator

1

VIOLENT DEATHS AT SCHOOL AND AWAY FROM SCHOOL
The percentage of youth homicides occurring at school remained at less than 2 percent of
the total number of youth homicides over all available survey years even though the absolute
number of homicides of school-age youth at school varied to some degree across the years.
Violent deaths at schools are rare but tragic events with far-reaching effects on the school
population and surrounding community. From July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2006,
there were 35 school-associated violent deaths in elementary and secondary schools
in the United States (tables 1.1 and 1.2).3 In this indicator, a school-associated violent
death is deﬁned as “a homicide, suicide, legal intervention (involving a law enforcement
ofﬁcer), or unintentional ﬁrearm-related death in which the fatal injury occurred on the
campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States.” Victims
of school-associated violent deaths included students, staff members, and others who are
not students. School-associated violent deaths include violent deaths that occurred while
the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at school, or while the victim was
attending or traveling to or from an ofﬁcial school-sponsored event. At school and away
from school homicides and suicides data were drawn from a number of sources. Data for
school-associated violent deaths for the 2005–06 school year are preliminary. Data for total
homicides and suicides are available for 2004–05.4
The most recent data available for the total number of homicides of school-age youth are from
the 2004–05 school year (ﬁgure 1.1 and table 1.1), during which there were 1,534 homicides.
In the 2004 calendar year, there were 1,471 suicides of school-age youth. In each school year,
youth were over 50 times more likely to be murdered and were over 150 times more likely to
commit suicide when they were away from school than at school. From July 1, 2005, through
June 30, 2006, there were 14 homicides and 3 suicides of school-age youth (ages 5–18) at
school (ﬁgure 1.2 and table 1.1). Combined, this number translates into 1 homicide or suicide of
a school-age youth at school per 3.2 million students enrolled during the 2005–06 school year.5

This indicator has
been updated to
include 2005–06
data.

Between July 1, 1992, and June 30, 1999, no consistent pattern of increase or decrease was
observed in the number of homicides at school (ﬁgure 1.2 and table 1.1). During this period,
between 28 and 34 homicides of school-age youth occurred at school in each school year. The
number of homicides of school-age youth at school declined between the 1998–99 and 1999–
2000 school years from 33 to 13 homicides. The number of homicides of school-age youth at
school increased from 11 to 21 between the 2000–01 and 2004–05 school years, but dropped
to 14 in 2005–06. The percentage of youth homicides occurring at school remained at less than
2 percent of the total number of youth homicides over all available survey years even though
the absolute number of homicides of school-age youth at school varied to some degree across
the years. Between the 1992–93 and 2004–05 school years, from one to eight school-age youth
committed suicide at school each year, with no consistent pattern of increase or decrease.

Between July 1, 2005, and June 30, 2006, there were 35 student, staff, and nonstudent school-associated
violent deaths, including 26 homicides, 7 suicides, and 2 legal interventions (table 1.2).
4 Data on total suicides are available only by calendar year, whereas data on suicides and homicides at school
and total homicides are available by school year. Data for total suicides (2005) and total homicides (2005–06)
are not yet available.
5 The total projected number of students enrolled in prekindergarten through 12th grade during the 2005–06
school year was 54,772,000 (U.S. Department of Education 2007).

INCIDENCE OF VICTIMIZATION AT SCHOOL AND AWAY FROM SCHOOL
At school, total crime and theft victimization rates for students were not measurably
different between 2004 and 2005. The victimization rate of students age 12 to 18 at
school was 55 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2004 and 57 victimizations in 2005.
Theft and violence at school and while going to and from school can lead to a disruptive
and threatening environment, physical injury, and emotional stress, and can be an obstacle
to student achievement (Elliot, Hamburg, and Williams 1998). Data from the National
Crime Victimization Survey show that students age 12 to 18 were victims of about 1.5
million nonfatal crimes (theft plus violent crime) while they were at school and about
1.2 million nonfatal crimes while they were away from school in 2005 (table 2.1).6 These
ﬁgures represent total crime victimization rates of 57 crimes per 1,000 students at school,
and 47 crimes per 1,000 students away from school (ﬁgure 2.1 and table 2.1).
Between 1992 and 2005, the total crime victimization rates for students age 12 to 18
generally declined both at school and away from school; this pattern held for the total crime
rate as well as for thefts,7 violent crimes,8 and serious violent crimes9 (ﬁgure 2.1 and table
2.1). At school, total crime and theft victimization rates for students were not measurably
different between 2004 and 2005. The victimization rate of students age 12 to 18 at school
was 55 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2004 and 57 victimizations in 2005. There were
an estimated 33 theft victimizations per 1,000 students at school in both 2004 and 2005.
Away from school, total crime and violent crime victimization rates were also not measurably
different between 2004 and 2005. There were 48 total crime victimizations per 1,000 students
away from school in 2004 and 47 victimizations in 2005. There were 21 violent victimizations
per 1,000 students away from school in 2004 and 24 violent victimizations in 2005.
Generally, more students age 12 to 18 were victims of theft at school than away from school
between 1992 and 2005. In 2005, students were victims of 868,000 crimes of theft at school
and 610,000 crimes of theft away from school. This translates into 33 thefts per 1,000 students
at school, compared to 23 thefts per 1,000 students away from school. From 1992 to 1997,
the victimization rates for violent crime were generally lower at school than away from school;
however, there were no measurable differences in these rates in the years between 1998 and
2005, except in 2000, when victimization rates at school were lower. The rates for serious
violent crime were lower at school than away from school in each survey year from 1992
to 2005. In 2005, students age 12 to 18 were victims of 5 serious violent crimes per 1,000
students at school, compared to 10 serious violent crimes per 1,000 students away from school.

The victimization rates for students age 12 to 18 varied according to certain student
characteristics in 2005. A greater percentage of younger students (age 12 to 14) than older
students (age 15 to 18) were victims of crime at school, but the reverse was true away from
school (ﬁgures 2.2 and 2.3 and tables 2.2 and 2.3). Students residing in suburban areas had
a lower rate of violent victimization at school and away from school than students in urban
areas, while no measurable difference was found between the rates of violent victimization
in suburban and rural areas.

“Students” refers to youth ages 12–18 whose educational attainment did not exceed grade 12 at the time
of the survey. An uncertain percentage of these persons may not have attended school during the survey
reference period. These data do not take into account the number of hours that students spend at school or
away from school.
7 Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts except motor vehicle
thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which threat or use of force is involved.
8 Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and simple assault.
9 Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.

PREVALENCE OF VICTIMIZATION AT SCHOOL
In 2005, some 4 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being victimized at
school during the previous 6 months. About 3 percent reported theft, 1 percent
reported violent victimization, and less than half of a percent of students reported
serious violent victimization.
Theft is the most frequent type of nonfatal crime in the United States (U.S. Department
of Justice 2006). Data from the School Crime Supplement10 to the National Crime
Victimization Survey show the percentage of students ages 12–18 who reported criminal
victimization at school during the previous 6 months. In 2005, some 4 percent of students
ages 12–18 reported being victimized at school during the previous 6 months. About 3
percent reported theft,11 1 percent reported violent victimization12 (ﬁgure 3.1 and table
3.1), and less than half of a percent of students reported serious violent victimization.13
Overall, the percentage of students ages 12–18 who were victimized at school during the
previous 6 months decreased between 1995 and 2005 from 10 to 4 percent. For each type
of victimization, the percentage of students reporting victimization decreased between 1995
and 2005 (ﬁgure 3.1 and table 3.1). Between the most recent survey years (2003 and 2005),
the percentage of students reporting victimization declined from 5 to 4 percent, and the
percentage reporting theft declined from 4 to 3 percent. There were no measurable changes
in the percentages reporting violent and serious violent crime during this period.
In 2005, the prevalence of victimization varied somewhat according to student
characteristics. Male students were more likely than female students to report being victims
of violent crime at school (2 vs. 1 percent), but no measurable differences were detected
by sex in the likelihood of reporting theft (3 percent each). There were also no measurable
differences in the percentages reporting victimization across grades. Further, in 2005, no
measurable differences were detected in the percentages of White, Black, or Hispanic
students who reported victimization, theft, or violent victimization. Students in urban schools
were more likely to report victimization (5 percent) and theft (4 percent) than students in
rural schools (3 and 2 percent, respectively). However, no other measurable differences were
observed by urbanicity.

THREATS AND INJURIES WITH WEAPONS ON SCHOOL PROPERTY
The percentage of students who were threatened or injured with a weapon has
ﬂuctuated between 7–9 percent in all survey years from 1993 through 2005.

Every year, some students are threatened or injured with a weapon while they are on school
property. The percentage of students victimized in this way provides an important measure
of how safe our schools are and how their safety has changed over time. In the Youth Risk
Behavior Survey, students in grades 9–12 were asked whether they had been threatened
or injured with a weapon on school property during the 12 months preceding the survey.
In 2005, some 8 percent of students reported being threatened or injured with a weapon,
such as a gun, knife, or club, on school property (table 4.1). The percentage of students who
were threatened or injured with a weapon ﬂuctuated between 1993 and 2005 without a
clear trend. In all survey years from 1993 through 2005, between 7–9 percent of students
reported being threatened or injured in this way.
The likelihood of being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property varied by
student characteristics. In each survey year, males were more likely than females to report
being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (ﬁgure 4.1 and table 4.1).
In 2005, some 10 percent of male students reported being threatened or injured in the past
year, compared with 6 percent of female students. In each survey year, students in lower
grades were generally more likely to report being threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property than those in higher grades (ﬁgure 4.2 and table 4.1). Eleven percent of 9thgraders reported that they were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property in
2005, compared with 9 percent of 10th-graders and 6 percent of 11th- and 12th-graders.
Students’ likelihood of being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property varied
by race/ethnicity in 2005. Hispanic students were more likely than White students to report
being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (10 vs. 7 percent). However,
no measurable differences were found in the percentages of Black and White students or
Black and Hispanic students who reported being threatened or injured in this way.

In 2005, student reports of being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property
varied among states for which data were available. Among states, the percentage of students
with such reports ranged from 5 to 12 percent (table 4.2).

TEACHERS THREATENED WITH INJURY OR PHYSICALLY ATTACKED
BY STUDENTS
In the 2003–04 school year, a greater percentage of public teachers in city schools
than their peers in suburban, town, or rural schools reported being threatened with
injury or physically attacked.
Students are not the only victims of intimidation or violence in schools. Teachers are also
subject to threats and physical attacks, and students from their schools sometimes commit
these offenses. In the Schools and Stafﬁng Survey, teachers were asked whether they had been
threatened with injury or physically attacked by a student from their school in the previous 12
months. A smaller percentage of teachers, 7 percent, were threatened with injury by a student
from their school in the 2003–04 school year than in 1993–94 and 1999–2000 school years, 12
and 9 percent respectively (ﬁgure 5.1 and table 5.1). A smaller percentage of teachers reported
being physically attacked in 2003–04, 3 percent, than in 1993–94, 4 percent (table 5.2).
A greater percentage of teachers in city schools reported being threatened with injury or
physically attacked in 2003–04 than teachers in suburban, town, or rural schools (ﬁgure 5.2
and tables 5.1 and 5.2). For example, in 2003–04, 10 percent of teachers in city schools
were threatened with injury by students, compared to 6 percent of teachers in suburban
schools, 5 percent of teachers in town schools, and 5 percent of teachers in rural schools.
Five percent of teachers in city schools were physically attacked by students, compared to
3 percent of teachers in suburban schools, 3 percent of teachers in town schools, and 2
percent of teachers in rural schools. A greater percentage of teachers in suburban schools
reported being threatened with injury or physically attacked than teachers in rural schools.

This indicator has
been modiﬁed
to include new
urbanicity codes.

In the 2003–04 school year, teachers’ reports of being threatened or physically attacked by students
varied according to the level of their school. A greater percentage of secondary school teachers,
8 percent, reported being threatened with injury by a student than elementary school teachers,
6 percent (table 5.1). However, a greater percentage of elementary school teachers, 4 percent,
reported having been physically attacked than secondary school teachers, 2 percent (table 5.2).
Generally, a greater percentage of elementary and secondary teachers in city schools reported
being threatened with injury or physically attacked than elementary or secondary teachers in
suburban, town, or rural schools (ﬁgure 5.2). For example, in the 2003–04 school year, 12 percent
of secondary teachers in city schools reported being threatened with injury compared to 7 percent
of secondary suburban school teachers, and 6 percent of town and rural secondary school teachers.

A greater percentage of public than private school teachers reported being threatened with
injury (7 vs. 2 percent) or physically attacked (4 vs. 2 percent) by students in school (tables
5.1 and 5.2). Among teachers in city schools, those in public schools were at least ﬁve times
more likely to be threatened with injury than their colleagues in private schools (12 vs. 2
percent) and at least four times more likely to be physically attacked (5 vs. 1 percent).
Public school teachers’ reports of being threatened with injury or physically attacked varied
among states. In 2003–04, the percentage of public school teachers who reported being
threatened in the previous 12 months ranged from 4 to 18 percent (table 5.3), and the
percentage who were physically attacked ranged from 1 to 7 percent (table 5.4).

VIOLENT AND OTHER CRIME INCIDENTS AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND
THOSE REPORTED TO THE POLICE
In 2005–06, 78 percent of schools experienced one or more violent incidents of
crime, 17 percent experienced one or more serious violent incidents, 46 percent
experienced one or more thefts, and 68 percent experienced another type of crime.
This indicator presents the percentage of schools that experienced one or more speciﬁed crimes,
the total number of these crimes reported by schools, and the rate of crimes per 1,000 students.
These data are also presented for the crimes that were reported to the police. In the School
Survey on Crime and Safety, public school principals were asked to provide the number of
serious violent incidents,14 violent incidents,15 thefts of items valued at $10 or greater, and other
incidents16 that occurred at their school, as well as the number of these incidents reported to
the police. During the 2005–06 school year, 86 percent of public schools responded that one
or more incidents of these crimes had taken place (including violent incidents, theft, and other
crimes), amounting to an estimated 2.2 million crimes (ﬁgure 6.1 and table 6.1). This ﬁgure
translates into a rate of 46 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled in 2005–06. During the same
year, 61 percent of schools reported an incident of one of the speciﬁed crimes to the police,
amounting to about 763,000 crimes—or 16 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled.
In 2005–06, 78 percent of schools experienced one or more violent incidents of crime, 17
percent experienced one or more serious violent incidents, 46 percent experienced one
or more thefts, and 68 percent experienced another type of crime. Thirty-eight percent of
public schools reported at least one violent incident to police, 13 percent reported at least
one serious violent incident to police, 28 percent reported at least one theft to police, and
51 percent reported one of the other speciﬁed crimes to police.

This indicator has
been updated to
include 2005–06
data.

The prevalence of violent incidents at public schools and those reported to the police varied by
school level (ﬁgure 6.2 and tables 6.2 and 6.3). A smaller percentage of primary schools than
middle or high schools experienced any violent incident: 67 percent of primary schools did so,
compared to 94 percent of middle schools and 95 percent of high schools. Similar relationships
were observed for serious violent incidents, theft, and other incidents. However, both primary
schools and high schools had lower rates of violent crime per 1,000 students than middle
schools. In 2005–06, there were 25 to 26 violent crimes per 1,000 students in primary schools
and high schools, compared to 52 violent crimes in middle schools. Rates of serious violent
crime ranged between 1 and 2 per 1,000 students for different school levels in 2005–06.
The percentage of public schools experiencing incidents of crime was lower in 2005–06 than
in 2003–04. In 2003–04, 88 percent of schools experienced crimes, compared to 86 percent of
schools in 2005–06 (ﬁgure 6.3 and table 6.1). The percentage of schools experiencing crimes in
2005–06 was not measurably different from the percentage of schools experiencing crimes in
1999–2000. The percentage of public schools that reported crimes to the police followed a similar
pattern. In 1999–2000, 62 percent of schools reported crimes to the police, in 2003–04, 65
percent of schools reported crimes to the police, and in 2005–06, 61 percent of schools did so.
14 Serious violent incidents include rape or attempted rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or
ﬁght with a weapon, threat of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon.
15 Violent incidents include serious violent incidents plus physical attacks or ﬁghts without a weapon and
threats of physical attacks without a weapon.
16 Other incidents include possession of a ﬁrearm or explosive device, possession of a knife or sharp object,
distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol, and vandalism.

DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS REPORTED BY PUBLIC SCHOOLS
Between 1999–2000 and 2005–06, the percentage of principals reporting student
bullying as a frequently occurring discipline problem declined from 29 to 24
percent and student verbal abuse of teachers declined from 13 to 9 percent.
The existence of discipline problems in a school may contribute to an environment that
facilitates school violence and crime. In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, school
principals were asked how often certain disciplinary problems happen in their schools.
This indicator examines the daily or weekly occurrence of student racial tensions, bullying,
sexual harassment of other students, verbal abuse of teachers, widespread classroom
disorder, and acts of disrespect for teachers in public schools. It also looks at occurrences
of undesirable gang and cult activities, and due to the severe nature of these incidents,
presents all reports of gang and cult activities during the school year.
Twenty-four percent of public schools reported that bullying occurred among students on a
daily or weekly basis and 18 percent reported that student acts of disrespect for teachers took
place on a daily or weekly basis during the 2005–06 school year (ﬁgure 7.1 and table 7.1). With
regard to other frequently occurring discipline problems in public schools (those occurring at
least once a week), 9 percent of principals reported student verbal abuse of teachers, 3 percent
reported student sexual harassment of other students, 3 percent reported student racial/ethnic
tensions, and 2 percent reported widespread disorder in classrooms. Seventeen percent of
public schools reported that undesirable gang activities and 4 percent reported that undesirable
cult or extremist activities had happened at all during 2005–06. The percentage of principals
reporting that student bullying and student verbal abuse of teachers occurred at least once a
week declined between 1999–2000 and 2005–06 (table 7.1). During this period, the percentage
of principals reporting student bullying as a frequently occurring discipline problem declined
from 29 to 24 percent and student verbal abuse of teachers declined from 13 to 9 percent.

This indicator has
been updated to
include 2005–06
data.

Discipline problems reported by public schools varied by school characteristics in 2005–06.
In general, the percentage of principals reporting discipline problems was higher in large
schools than in small schools (ﬁgure 7.1 and table 7.2). For example, 35 percent of principals
at schools with 1,000 or more students reported that student acts of disrespect for teachers
occurred at least once a week, whereas 12 percent at schools with less than 300 students
reported this discipline problem. Also, in 2005–06, a higher percentage of middle schools
than primary schools reported various types of discipline problems. Also, a higher percentage
of middle schools than high schools reported daily or weekly occurrences of student bullying
and student sexual harassment of other students.
In 2005–06, the percentage of schools reporting the discipline problems of widespread
disorder in the classroom, student acts of disrespect for teachers, student verbal abuse of
teachers, and undesirable gang activities was generally smaller for schools where 20 percent
or fewer of the students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch than for schools where
more than 50 percent of the students were eligible (table 7.2). For example, 14 percent of
schools where more than 50 percent of the students were eligible for free or reduced-price
lunch reported the daily or weekly occurrence of student verbal abuse of teachers compared to
3 percent of schools where 20 percent or fewer of the students were eligible. The percentage of
students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch programs is a proxy measure of school poverty.

STUDENTS’ REPORTS OF GANGS AT SCHOOL
The percentage of students reporting the presence of gangs at school increased
from 21 to 24 percent between 2003 and 2005.

Gangs are organized groups often involved in drugs, weapons trafﬁcking, and violence. Such
gangs at school can be disruptive to the school environment because their presence may
incite fear among students and increase the level of school violence (Laub and Lauritsen
1998). In the School Crime Supplement17 to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students
ages 12–18 were asked if gangs were present at their school during the previous 6 months.
In 2005, some 24 percent of students reported that there were gangs at their schools (ﬁgure
8.1 and table 8.1). Students in urban schools were more likely to report the presence of
gangs at their school than suburban students and rural students (36 vs. 21 and 16 percent,
respectively). No measurable difference was found between suburban and rural students in
their likelihood of reporting gang presence.
The total percentage of students who reported the presence of gangs at school increased
from 21 percent in 2003 to 24 percent in 2005. The only statistically signiﬁcant increase
in the reported presence of gangs occurred in urban schools; the percentage of students
who reported that gangs were present at school increased from 31 to 36 percent during this
period. No measurable change was found for the percentage of suburban or rural students
reporting gang presence during this period.
Hispanic and Black students were more likely than White students to report gangs in their
schools in 2005 (38 and 37 percent, respectively, vs. 17 percent; ﬁgure 8.2 and table 8.1).
This pattern held among students in both urban and suburban schools. Between 2003 and
2005, reports of gangs increased among both Black students (29 vs. 37 percent) and White
students (14 vs. 17 percent). No measurable change was detected in the percentage of
Hispanic students reporting the presence of gangs between 2003 and 2005.

Students in public schools were more likely to report the presence of gangs than were
students in private schools regardless of the school’s location (table 8.1). In 2005, some
25 percent of students in public schools reported that there were gangs in their schools,
compared with 4 percent of students in private schools.
In 2005, there were no measurable differences between males and females in the extent
to which they reported gang presence in their schools, with the exception of males at
suburban schools, who were more likely to report gang presence than females (22 vs. 19
percent). Between 2001 and 2005, the percentage of male students reporting the presence
of gangs increased (from 21 to 25 percent), as did the percentage of suburban males
reporting gang activity (from 19 to 22 percent). In the same time period, the percentage of
urban females reporting gang activity also increased from 26 to 34 percent.

STUDENTS’ REPORTS OF DRUG AVAILABILITY ON SCHOOL PROPERTY
In 2005, one-quarter of all students in grades 9–12 reported that someone had
offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug on school property in the past 12
months.
The availability of drugs on school property has a disruptive and corrupting inﬂuence on
the school environment (Nolin et al. 1997). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students
in grades 9–12 were asked whether someone had offered, sold, or given them an illegal
drug on school property in the 12 months before the survey. In 2005, some 25 percent of
students in grades 9–12 reported that drugs were made available to them on school property
(table 9.1). There was no measurable change in the percentage of students who reported
that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them at school between 2003 and 2005.
Males were more likely than females to report that drugs were offered, sold, or given to
them on school property in each survey year from 1993 to 2005 (ﬁgure 9.1 and table
9.1). For example, in 2005, some 29 percent of males reported that drugs were available,
compared with 22 percent of females. No measurable differences were detected in the
percentage of students who reported that drugs were made available to them according to
grade level in 2005.
The percentages of students who reported having illegal drugs offered, sold, or given to
them on school property differed across racial/ethnic groups (ﬁgure 9.2 and table 9.1).
Speciﬁcally, in 2005, Hispanic students were more likely than Asian, Black, American
Indian, and White students to report that drugs were made available to them (34 vs. 16–24
percent). Although it appears that Paciﬁc Islander students were more likely than Hispanic
students to report that drugs were made available to them, the difference was not found to
be statistically signiﬁcant.
In 2005, student reports of the availability of drugs on school property varied among states
for which data were available. Among states, the percentage of students who reported that
drugs were available to them at school ranged from 16 to 39 percent (table 9.2).

STUDENTS’ REPORTS OF BEING CALLED HATE-RELATED WORDS AND
SEEING HATE-RELATED GRAFFITI
In 2005, some 11 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that someone at school
had used hate-related words against them, and more than one-third (38 percent)
had seen hate-related grafﬁti at school.
In the 2005 School Crime Supplement18 to the National Crime Victimization Survey,
students ages 12–18 were asked if someone at school had called them a derogatory word
having to do with their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, or sexual orientation and if
they had seen hate-related grafﬁti during the previous 6 months. With regard to hate-related
words, students were also asked to specify the characteristic to which the word was directed.
In 2005, some 11 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that someone at school had
used hate-related words against them (ﬁgure 10.1 and table 10.1). Five percent of students
reported that the hate-related words concerned their race, 3 percent reported that the words
were related to their ethnicity, about 2 percent each reported that the words concerned
their religion or gender, and 1 percent each reported that the words were related to their
disability or sexual orientation (table 10.2). Students were also asked if they had seen haterelated grafﬁti at their school—that is, hate-related words or symbols written in classrooms,
bathrooms, hallways, or on the outside of the school building (ﬁgure 10.1 and table 10.1).
Some 38 percent of students reported seeing hate-related grafﬁti at school.
Students’ experiences of being called speciﬁc types of hate-related words in 2005 differed
according to their sex and race/ethnicity (table 10.2). Females were more likely to report
gender-related hate words than were males (3 vs. 1 percent) while male students were
more likely than female students to report hate words related to both race (5 vs. 4 percent)
and ethnicity (3 vs. 2 percent). White students were less likely to report race-related hate
words than were Black and Hispanic students as well as students whose racial/ethnic group
was categorized as “Other” (3 percent of White students vs. 7 percent of Black students, 6
percent of Hispanic students, and 9 percent of Other students).

In 2005, measurable differences were found in students’ reports of being called hate-related
words and seeing hate-related grafﬁti according to the urbanicity and sector of their schools
(ﬁgure 10.1 and table 10.1). Suburban students were less likely than both urban students
(9 vs. 12 percent) and rural students (9 vs. 15 percent) to report being called a hate-related
word. Public school students were more likely than their private school counterparts to
report being called a hate-related word (12 vs. 7 percent) and seeing hate-related grafﬁti (39
vs. 18 percent).

BULLYING AT SCHOOL
In 2005, about 28 percent of 12- to 18-year-old students reported having been
bullied at school during the last 6 months.
Both bullying and being bullied at school are associated with key violence-related behaviors,
including carrying weapons, ﬁghting, and sustaining injuries from ﬁghting (Nansel et al. 2003).
In the 2005 School Crime Supplement19 to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students
ages 12–18 were asked if they had been bullied at school during the previous 6 months.20
In 2005, about 28 percent of students reported having been bullied at school during the
last 6 months (ﬁgure 11.1 and table 11.1). Nineteen percent of students said that they had
experienced bullying that consisted of being made fun of; 15 percent reported being the
subject of rumors; and 9 percent said that they were pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on
(ﬁgure 11.2 and table 11.1). Of those students who had been bullied, 79 percent said that
they were bullied inside the school, and 28 percent said that they were bullied outside on
school grounds (ﬁgure 11.2 and table 11.2). Of the students in 2005 who reported being
bullied during the previous 6 months, 53 percent said that they had been bullied once or
twice during that period, 25 percent had experienced bullying once or twice a month, 11
percent reported being bullied once or twice a week, and 8 percent said that they had been
bullied almost daily (table 11.3).
White and Black students (30 and 29 percent) were more likely than Hispanic students to
report being bullied in 2005 (22 percent; table 11.1). White students were also more likely
than students of Other racial/ethnic groups to report being bullied (30 vs. 25 percent), and
to report that they were the subject of rumors than were Hispanic students and students of
Other racial/ethnic groups (16 vs. 12 percent).
In general, grade level was inversely related to students’ likelihood of being bullied: as
grade level increased, students’ likelihood of being bullied decreased (table 11.1). In 2005,
about 37 percent of 6th-graders, 28 percent of 9th-graders, and 20 percent of 12th-graders
reported that they had been bullied at school. Students in public schools were more likely
to report bullying incidents than were their private school counterparts (29 vs. 23 percent).

Of those students who reported bullying incidents that involved being pushed, shoved, tripped,
or spit on (9 percent), 24 percent reported that they had sustained an injury21 as a result (table
11.2). While no measurable differences were found by sex in students’ likelihood of reporting
a bullying incident in 2005, among students who reported being bullied, males were more
likely than females to report being injured during such an incident (31 vs. 18 percent).

20 In 2005, the questionnaire wording for the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization
Survey was modiﬁed with regard to bullying. In the 1999, 2001, and 2003 surveys, students were simply
asked whether they had been bullied in the previous 6 months, while the 2005 iteration posed a series of
questions on bullying and provided respondents with more examples of bullying behavior. Bullying includes
being made fun of; subject of rumors; threatened with harm; pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; pressured
into doing things did not want to do; excluded; or property destroyed on purpose.
21 Injury includes bruises or swelling; cuts, scratches, or scrapes; black eye or bloody nose; teeth chipped or
knocked out; broken bones or internal injuries; knocked unconscious; or other injuries.

TEACHERS’ REPORTS OF SCHOOL CONDITIONS
The percentage of teachers who reported that student misbehavior, class cutting, and
tardiness interfered with their teaching varied by teacher and school characteristics. A
higher percentage of teachers in city schools than in suburban, rural, or town schools
reported that misbehavior and student tardiness interfered with their teaching in 2003–04.
Classroom disruptions are associated with lower student achievement for the offending
student as well as for that student’s classmates (Lannie and McCurdy 2007). In the Schools
and Stafﬁng Survey, public and private school teachers were asked if student misbehavior
and student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching. In 2003–04, 35
percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that student misbehavior interfered with
their teaching, and 31 percent reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered
with their teaching (table 12.1). Teachers were also asked if school rules were enforced by
other teachers at their school, even for students not in their classes, or by the principal.
Seventy-two percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that other teachers at their school
enforced the school rules and 88 percent reported that the principal enforced the school
rules in 2003–04 (ﬁgure 12.1 and table 12.2).

The percentage of teachers who reported that student misbehavior, class cutting, and tardiness
interfered with their teaching varied by teacher and school characteristics. In 2003–04,
a higher percentage of teachers in city schools than in suburban, town, or rural schools
reported that misbehavior and student tardiness interfered with their teaching (table 12.1).
For example, 42 percent of teachers in city schools reported that student misbehavior in
their school interfered with their teaching, compared to 33 percent of suburban teachers, 34
percent of town teachers, and 31 percent of rural teachers. Between 1987–88 and 2003–04, a
larger percentage of public school teachers than private school teachers reported that student
misbehavior and tardiness interfered with their teaching (ﬁgure 12.2 and table 12.1). In 2003–
04, about 37 percent of public school teachers reported that student misbehavior interfered
with their teaching, compared to 21 percent of private school teachers. In 2003–04, a higher
percentage of secondary school teachers than elementary school teachers agreed that student
misbehavior, student tardiness, and class cutting interfered with their teaching (table 12.1).
In 2003–04, for example, 40 percent of secondary school teachers reported that student
misbehavior interfered with their teaching, compared to 34 percent of elementary teachers.
The percentage of teachers who agreed that school rules were enforced by other teachers
varied by teacher and school characteristics. In every survey year, a higher percentage
of elementary school teachers than secondary school teachers agreed that school rules
were enforced by teachers in their school, even for students not in their class (table 12.2
and ﬁgure 12.1). In 2003–04, for example, 79 percent of elementary teachers reported
that school rules were enforced by other teachers compared to 56 percent of secondary
teachers. Generally, the percentage of teachers who agreed or strongly agreed that school
rules were enforced by other teachers was greater in schools with smaller school enrollment
(table 12.2). In 2003–04, about 84 percent of teachers in schools with fewer than 200
students agreed that school rules were enforced by other teachers, compared to 56 percent
of teachers in schools with 1,000 or more students.

PHYSICAL FIGHTS ON SCHOOL PROPERTY AND ANYWHERE
The percentage of 9th- to 12th-grade students who reported being in a physical
ﬁght anywhere increased from 33 to 36 percent between 2003 and 2005.
Schools where physical ﬁghts occur frequently may not be able to maintain a focused
learning environment for students. Further, students who participate in ﬁghts on school
property may have difﬁculty succeeding in their studies (Payne, Gottfredson, and Gottfredson
2003). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9–12 were asked about their
general involvement in physical ﬁghts during the preceding 12 months (referred to as
“anywhere” in this report) and their involvement in physical ﬁghts on school property. Fights
occurring anywhere are included as a point of comparison with ﬁghts occurring on school
property. In 2005, some 36 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported being in a ﬁght
anywhere, and 14 percent said they had been in a ﬁght on school property (ﬁgure 13.1 and
table 13.1). Between 2003 and 2005, the percentage of students who reported being in a ﬁght
anywhere increased from 33 to 36 percent. However, there was no measurable change in the
percentage of students who reported ﬁghting on school property during the same period.
In all survey years, males were more likely than females to have been in a ﬁght anywhere
and on school property (ﬁgure 13.1 and table 13.1). In 2005, 43 percent of males said they
had been in a ﬁght anywhere, compared with 28 percent of females. In the same year, 18
percent of males said they had been in a ﬁght on school property, compared with 9 percent
of females. Between 2003 and 2005, the percentage of females who reported having been
in a physical ﬁght anywhere increased from 25 to 28 percent.
In 2005, students in lower grades were more likely to report being in ﬁghts than students
in higher grades, both anywhere and on school property (ﬁgure 13.2 and table 13.1). In
that year, 19 percent of 9th-graders, 14 percent of 10th-graders, 10 percent of 11th-graders,
and 9 percent of 12th-graders reported being in a ﬁght on school property. While it appears
that students in most grades were more likely to report being in a physical ﬁght in 2005
than in 2003, the only measurable increase found was for 9th-grade students anywhere:
between 2003 and 2005, the percentage of 9th-graders who reported having been in a ﬁght
anywhere increased from 39 to 43 percent.

In 2005, the percentage of students engaging in ﬁghts varied according to their race/
ethnicity. Speciﬁcally, Asian students were less likely than students from all other racial/
ethnic groups to report being in a ﬁght anywhere or on school property. Six percent of
Asian students reported being in a ﬁght on school property, compared with 12 to 24 percent
of students from other racial/ethnic groups. Between 2003 and 2005, the percentage of
Hispanic students who reported having been in a ﬁght anywhere increased from 36 to 41
percent. During the same period, the percentage of Asian students who reported having
been in a ﬁght on school property declined from 13 to 6 percent.
In 2005, the percentage of students who reported being in a ﬁght varied among states for which
data were available. Among states, the percentages ranged from 24 to 37 percent for being in a
ﬁght anywhere, and from 8 to 16 percent for being in a ﬁght on school property (table 13.2).

STUDENTS CARRYING WEAPONS ON SCHOOL PROPERTY AND
ANYWHERE
There was no measurable change in the percentage of students who reported
carrying a weapon at school between 1999 and 2005: about 6 percent did so in
both years.
The presence of weapons at school may interfere with teaching and learning by creating
an intimidating and threatening atmosphere (Aspy et al. 2004). In the Youth Risk Behavior
Survey, students were asked if they had carried a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club
in the past 30 days (referred to as “anywhere” in this report) or had carried one of these
weapons on school property in the past 30 days. Weapon carrying anywhere is included as
a point of comparison with weapon carrying on school property. In 2005, some 19 percent
of students in grades 9–12 reported they had carried a weapon anywhere, and about 6
percent reported they had carried a weapon on school property (ﬁgure 14.1 and table 14.1).
The percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere declined from 22
to 18 percent between 1993 and 1997. However, subsequently, there was no measurable
change in the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere. Similar
to the pattern for carrying a weapon anywhere, between 1993 and 1999, the percentage
of students who reported carrying a weapon at school declined from 12 to 7 percent.
However, there was no measurable change in the percentage of students who carried a
weapon at school between 1999 and 2005.
When looking at the characteristics of students who reported carrying weapons, males were
more than two times more likely than females to carry a weapon—either anywhere or on
school property—in all survey years (ﬁgure 14.1 and table 14.1). In 2005, for example, some
10 percent of males carried a weapon on school property, compared with 3 percent of females,
and 30 percent of males carried a weapon anywhere, compared with 7 percent of females.

In 2005, few differences were detected in the percentage of students who reported carrying
weapons anywhere and on school property according to students’ race/ethnicity (ﬁgure
14.2 and table 14.1). Asian students were less likely than students from all other racial/
ethnic groups, except Paciﬁc Islanders,22 to report carrying a weapon anywhere, but no
measurable differences were detected among Black, White, and Hispanic students. Asian
students were also less likely than students from all other racial/ethnic groups, except for
Blacks, to report carrying a weapon on school property, but no differences were detected
among Black, White, and American Indian students. Hispanic students were more likely
than Black students to report carrying a weapon during the previous 30 days on school
property in 2005 (8 vs. 5 percent). Between 2003 and 2005, the percentage of Hispanic
students who reported doing so increased from 6 to 8 percent.
In 2005, the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon varied among states
for which data were available. Among states, the percentages ranged from 11 to 28 percent
for carrying a weapon anywhere, and from 4 to 11 percent for carrying a weapon on school
property (table 14.2).

STUDENTS’ USE OF ALCOHOL ON SCHOOL PROPERTY AND ANYWHERE
In 2005, some 43 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported having at least
one drink of alcohol anywhere, and 4 percent had at least one drink on school
property in the 30 days before being surveyed.
Students’ illegal consumption of alcohol on school property may lead to additional crimes
and misbehavior. It may also foster a school environment that is harmful to students,
teachers, and staff (Fagan and Wilkinson 1998). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students
in grades 9–12 were asked whether they had consumed alcohol at all in the past 30 days
(referred to as “anywhere” in this report) and if they had consumed alcohol on school
property. Alcohol consumption anywhere is included as a point of comparison with alcohol
consumption on school property. In 2005, some 43 percent of students consumed at least
one drink of alcohol anywhere, and 4 percent consumed at least one drink on school
property (ﬁgure 15.1 and table 15.1). The percentage of students who reported drinking
alcohol anywhere increased from 48 to 52 percent between 1993 and 1995 and then
declined to 43 percent in 2005. No consistent pattern was detected in the percentage of
students who reported consuming alcohol on school property between 1993 and 2005: over
these years, the percentage ﬂuctuated from 4 to 6 percent.
The likelihood of drinking alcohol varied by student characteristics including sex, grade
level, and race/ethnicity. In 2005, males were more likely than females to report using
alcohol on school property (5 vs. 3 percent), a difference not found in the percentage who
reported drinking anywhere (ﬁgure 15.1 and table 15.1). In 2005, students in higher grades
were more likely to report drinking alcohol anywhere than were students in lower grades.
For example, 51 percent of 12th-graders reported using alcohol, compared with 36 percent
of 9th-graders (ﬁgure 15.2 and table 15.1). However, no measurable difference was found
across grade levels in students’ likelihood of drinking alcohol on school property.

In 2005, Asian and Black students were less likely to report using alcohol anywhere than
were American Indian, White, or Hispanic students. Twenty-two percent of Asian students
and 31 percent of Black students reported using alcohol anywhere, compared with 46
percent of White students, 47 percent of Hispanic students, and 57 percent of American
Indian students. In the same year, Hispanic students (8 percent) were more likely to use
alcohol on school property than were White, Black, or Asian students (4, 3, and 1 percent,
respectively).
In 2005, the percentage of students who reported drinking alcohol varied among states for
which data were available. Among states, the percentages ranged from 16 to 49 percent for
drinking alcohol anywhere, and from 2 to 9 percent for drinking alcohol on school property
(table 15.2).

STUDENTS’ USE OF MARIJUANA ON SCHOOL PROPERTY AND ANYWHERE
In 2005, some 20 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported using marijuana
anywhere during the past 30 days, and 5 percent reported using marijuana on
school property.
In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9–12 were asked whether they had used
marijuana at all during the past 30 days (referred to as “anywhere” in this report) and whether
they had used marijuana on school property during this period. In 2005, some 20 percent of
students in grades 9–12 reported using marijuana anywhere during the past 30 days, and 5
percent reported using marijuana on school property (ﬁgure 16.1 and table 16.1).
The percentage of students who reported using marijuana anywhere increased between
1993 and 1995 (from 18 to 25 percent), and in 1995, 1997, and 1999, roughly one-quarter
of students reported using marijuana anywhere (between 25 and 27 percent). By 2005,
however, the percentage of students who reported using marijuana anywhere had declined
to 20 percent. The percentage of students who reported using marijuana on school property
increased from 6 to 9 percent between 1993 and 1995 and then declined to 5 percent in
2001. No measurable change was found in the percentage of students who reported using
marijuana during the past 30 days on school property between 2001 and 2005.
Both students’ sex and grade level were associated with the use of marijuana among those
in grades 9–12. Males were more likely than females to have reported using marijuana
during the past 30 days in every survey year, both anywhere and on school property (ﬁgure
16.1 and table 16.1). For example, in 2005, some 6 percent of males and 3 percent of
females reported using marijuana on school property. In that same year, 9th-grade students
were less likely than 11th- and 12th-grade students to report using marijuana anywhere
(ﬁgure 16.2 and table 16.1). While it appears that 9th-grade students were slightly more
likely to report using marijuana on school property than were their peers in other grades,
no measurable differences were detected in student reports of using marijuana on school
property by grade level.

In 2005, Asian students were less likely than students from other racial/ethnic groups,
except Paciﬁc Islander students, to report using marijuana anywhere (7 vs. 17–30 percent
of students in other racial/ethnic groups). American Indian students were more likely than
students from other racial/ethnic groups, except Hispanic students, to report using marijuana
anywhere (30 vs. 7–20 percent of students in other racial/ethnic groups). At school,
Hispanic students (8 percent) and American Indian students (9 percent) were more likely to
report using marijuana than were White or Black students (4 and 5 percent, respectively).
In 2005, the percentage of students who reported using marijuana varied among states for
which data were available. Among states, the percentages ranged from 8 to 26 percent for
using marijuana anywhere, and from 2 to 8 percent for using it on school property (table 16.2).

STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF PERSONAL SAFETY AT SCHOOL AND AWAY
FROM SCHOOL
In 2005, as grade level increased, the percentage of students reporting fear of an
attack at school or on the way to and from school decreased.

School violence can make students fearful and affect their readiness and ability to learn,
and concerns about vulnerability to attacks detract from a positive school environment
(Scheckner et al. 2002). In the School Crime Supplement23 to the National Crime
Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked how often they had been afraid of
attack “at school or on the way to and from school” and “away from school” during the
previous 6 months.24
In 2005, approximately 6 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they were afraid of
attack or harm at school, and 5 percent reported that they were afraid of attack or harm away
from school. There was no measurable change between 2003 and 2005 in the percentage of
students reporting fear of attack or harm at or away from school (ﬁgure 17.1 and table 17.1).
Consistent with ﬁndings from 1999 and 2001, students in 2005 were more likely to report
being afraid of an attack at school than away from school. The percentage of students who
reported that they were afraid of being attacked at school (including on the way to and from
school) decreased from 12 to 6 percent between 1995 and 2001; however, no measurable
difference was detected between 2001 and 2005. Similarly, there was no change in the
percentage of students who feared such an attack away from school between 1999 and 2005.
Black and Hispanic students were more likely than White students to fear for their safety
regardless of location in 2005 (ﬁgure 17.2 and table 17.1). Nine percent of Black students
and 10 percent of Hispanic students reported that they were afraid of being attacked at
school (including on the way to and from school), compared with 4 percent of White
students. Away from school, 7 percent of Black students, 6 percent of Hispanic students,
and 4 percent of White students reported that they were afraid of an attack. There was no
measurable change between 2003 and 2005 in the percentage of students who feared for
their safety in either location among White, Black, or Hispanic students.
In 2005, as grade level increased, students’ fear of an attack at school or on the way to and
from school decreased. In the same year, 10 percent of 6th-graders, 6 percent of 9th-graders,
and 3 percent of 12th-graders feared for their safety at school or on the way to and from school.

School location was also related to students’ fear of attack. In 2005, students in urban schools
were more likely than students in suburban and rural schools to fear being attacked at school
or on the way to and from school. Ten percent of students in urban schools feared being
attacked at school, compared with 5 percent each of their peers in suburban and rural schools.
School sector was also related to students’ fear of attack. In every survey year, students in public
schools were more likely than students in private schools to fear being attacked at school. In
2005, about 6 percent of public school students feared being attacked at school, compared
with 4 percent of private school students. Although it appears that the public school students
were generally more likely than their counterparts in private schools to fear being attacked away
from school in 2005, these differences were not found to be statistically signiﬁcant.

STUDENTS’ REPORTS OF AVOIDING SCHOOL ACTIVITIES OR SPECIFIC
PLACES IN SCHOOL
In 2005, some 6 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they avoided school
activities or one or more places in school because they thought someone might
attack or harm them.
School crime may lead students to perceive school as unsafe, and in trying to ensure their
own safety, students may begin to skip school activities or avoid certain places within
school (Schreck and Miller 2003). The percentage of students who avoid school activities
and certain areas in school is a measure of their perceptions of school safety. In the School
Crime Supplement25 to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18 were
asked whether they had avoided school activities or one or more places in school because
they were fearful that someone might attack or harm them.26 In 2005, some 6 percent of
students reported that they had avoided a school activity or one or more places in school
in the previous 6 months because of fear of attack or harm. About 2 percent of students
avoided a school activity, and 4 percent avoided one or more places in school27 (ﬁgure 18.1
and table 18.1).
The percentage of students ages 12–18 who reported that they avoided school activities
because they thought someone might attack or harm them there decreased from 3 to 2
percent between 1999 and 2001 and remained at about 2 percent through 2005 (ﬁgure
18.1 and table 18.1). Between 4 and 5 percent of students reported avoiding one or more
places in school during the same period.
Students’ reports of avoiding one or more places in school varied according to their race/
ethnicity. In 2005, Black and Hispanic students (7 and 6 percent, respectively) were more
likely than White students or those from some Other racial/ethnic background (4 and 3
percent, respectively) to report avoiding one or more places in school because they were
afraid someone might attack or harm them (table 18.2). As in all previous survey years,
no measurable difference was detected in the extent to which males and females avoided
places in 2005.

Generally, grade level was inversely associated with students’ likelihood of avoiding one or
more places in school. Eight percent of 6th-graders avoided one or more places in school in
2005, compared with 1 percent of 12th-graders (ﬁgure 18.2 and table 18.2).
Consistent with most previous years, students in urban areas in 2005 were the most likely
to avoid places in school: 6 percent of urban students reported that they had done so,
compared with 4 percent of suburban and rural students. In addition, public school students
were more likely than private school students to avoid places in school (5 vs. 1 percent).

SERIOUS DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS TAKEN BY PUBLIC SCHOOLS
Forty-eight percent of public schools (approximately 39,600 schools) took a
serious disciplinary action against a student for speciﬁc offenses during the 2005–
06 school year. Of those disciplinary actions, 74 percent were suspensions lasting
5 days or more, 5 percent were removals with no services (i.e., expulsions), and 20
percent were transfers to specialized schools.
In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school ofﬁcials were asked to report the
number of disciplinary actions their schools took against students for speciﬁc offenses.
Forty-eight percent of public schools (approximately 39,600 schools) took at least one
serious disciplinary action against a student—including suspensions lasting 5 days or
more, removals with no services (i.e., expulsions), and transfers to specialized schools—for
speciﬁc offenses during the 2005–06 school year (ﬁgure 19.1 and table 19.1). The offenses
included physical attacks or ﬁghts; insubordination; distribution, possession, or use of
alcohol; distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs; use or possession of a weapon
other than a ﬁrearm or explosive device; and use or possession of a ﬁrearm or explosive
device. Of the 830,700 serious disciplinary actions taken during the 2005–06 school year,
74 percent were suspensions for 5 days or more, 5 percent were removals with no services,
and 20 percent were transfers to specialized schools.
The largest percentage of schools that reported taking a disciplinary action in 2005–06 did
so in response to a physical attack or ﬁght: 32 percent of schools took a serious disciplinary
action for physical attacks or ﬁghts (ﬁgure 19.1 and table 19.1). Of the schools that reported
taking a serious disciplinary action, 21 percent took action for insubordination and for
distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs; 19 percent took action as a result of use
or possession of a weapon other than a ﬁrearm or explosive device; 10 percent did so for
distribution, possession, or use of alcohol; and 5 percent did so for use or possession of a
ﬁrearm or explosive device.

This indicator has
been updated to
include 2005–06
data.
•••
For more
information:

The percentage of schools that took a serious disciplinary action for use or possession of
a weapon other than a ﬁrearm was higher in 2005–06, 19 percent, than in 2003–04, 17
percent (table 19.2). The percentage of schools that took a serious disciplinary action in
response to the other offenses covered in the survey were not measurably different between
2003–04 and 2005–06. The percentage of public schools that took a serious disciplinary
action was smaller in 2003–04, 46 percent, than in 1999–2000, 54 percent (ﬁgure 19.2
and table 19.2). This pattern held for physical attacks or ﬁghts: in 1999–2000, 35 percent of
public schools took a serious disciplinary action for a physical attack or ﬁght, compared to
32 percent in 2003–04.

SAFETY AND SECURITY MEASURES TAKEN BY PUBLIC SCHOOLS
Between the 1999–2000 and 2005–06 school years, the percentage of schools
using one or more security cameras to monitor the school increased from 19 to 43
percent.
Public schools use a variety of practices and procedures intended to promote the safety of
students and staff. This indicator provides information on what types of safety and security
measures schools use and how frequently they use them. In the School Survey on Crime
and Safety, public school ofﬁcials were asked about their school’s use of such measures and
procedures. Certain practices, such as locked or monitored doors or gates, are intended to
limit or control access to school campuses, while others, such as metal detectors, security
cameras, and drug sweeps, are intended to monitor or restrict students’ and visitors’
behavior on campus.
In the 2005–06 school year, 85 percent of public schools controlled access to school
buildings by locking or monitoring doors during school hours, and 41 percent controlled
access to school grounds with locked or monitored gates (ﬁgure 20.1 and table 20.1).
About 48 percent of public schools required faculty and staff to wear badges or picture
identiﬁcation, and 43 percent used one or more security cameras to monitor the school.
Five percent of public schools performed drug testing on athletes and 3 percent did so for
students in other extracurricular activities. Students were required to wear uniforms in 14
percent of public schools in 2005–06.

This indicator has
been updated to
include 2005–06
data.

& 20.2

The use of security measures varied by school level. Although a lower percentage of primary
schools than middle and high schools reported using many of these measures, a higher
percentage of primary schools than middle and high schools controlled access to school
buildings and grounds during school hours (table 20.1). In addition, a larger percentage of
primary schools than high schools reported requiring students to wear uniforms: 16 percent
of primary schools required uniforms in 2005–06, compared to 5 percent of high schools.
A higher percentage of public high schools than primary or middle schools reported
performing drug tests on student athletes and students in extracurricular activities, random
dog sniffs to check for drugs, random sweeps for contraband, and using security cameras.
Thirteen percent of high schools reported performing drug tests on athletes, compared to 7
percent of middle schools and 1 percent of primary schools; and 61 percent of high schools
performed random dog sniffs to check for drugs, compared to 41 percent and 4 percent of
middle and primary schools, respectively.
The percentage of schools using various security measures has changed over time. Between
the 1999–2000 and 2005–06 school years, the percentage of schools using one or more
security cameras to monitor the school increased from 19 to 43 percent (ﬁgure 20.2 and
table 20.2). The percentage of public schools providing telephones in most classrooms also
increased, from 45 percent in 1999–2000 to 67 percent in 2005–06.

STUDENTS’ REPORTS OF SAFETY AND SECURITY MEASURES
OBSERVED AT SCHOOL
The percentage of students who reported observing the use of security cameras at
their schools increased from 39 to 58 percent between 2001 and 2005.

Schools use a variety of measures to promote the safety of students, ranging from codes
of student conduct to metal detectors. In the School Crime Supplement28 to the National
Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked whether their school used
certain security measures.29 Security measures include metal detectors, locker checks,
security cameras, security guards or police ofﬁcers, adult supervision in hallways, badges
or picture identiﬁcation for students, a code of student conduct, locked entrance or exit
doors during the day, and a requirement that visitors sign in. In 2005, nearly all (99 percent)
students ages 12–18 observed the use of at least one of the selected security measures at
their school (table 21.1).
In 2005, the vast majority of students ages 12–18 reported that their school had a student
code of conduct (95 percent) and a requirement that visitors sign in (93 percent; ﬁgure
21.1 and table 21.1). Ninety percent of students reported observing school staff or other
adult supervision in the hallway, and 68 percent reported the presence of security guards
and/or assigned police ofﬁcers. Between 53 and 58 percent of students reported locker
checks, locked entrance or exit doors during the day, and security cameras at their schools.
One-quarter of students reported that badges or picture identiﬁcation were required. Metal
detectors were the least observed of the selected safety and security measures: 11 percent of
students reported the use of metal detectors at their school.

This indicator
repeats
information
from the 2006
Indicators of
School Crime
and Safety report.

The percentage of students reporting the presence of many of the selected security measures
increased between 2001 and 2005 (ﬁgure 21.1 and table 21.1). For example, the percentage
of students who observed the use of security cameras at their schools increased from 39 to
58 percent during this period, and the percentage who reported that students were required
to wear badges or picture identiﬁcation increased from 21 to 25 percent. Between 1999 and
2005, there was also an increase in the percentage of students observing locked entrance or
exit doors during the day (from 38 to 54 percent), the percentage reporting a visitor sign-in
requirement (from 87 to 93 percent), and the percentage reporting the presence of security
guards and/or assigned police ofﬁcers (from 54 to 68 percent). No differences were detected
in the percentage of students reporting locker checks or a code of student conduct in their
schools across all survey years.

1
Serious violent crimes are also included in violent crimes.
2
Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, and, from 2003 onward, more than one race. For this report, non-Hispanic students who identified themselves as
more than one race were included in the Other category. Respondents who identified themselves as being of Hispanic origin are classified as Hispanic, regardless of their race. Due to
changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.
NOTE: Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and completed thefts except motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include
robbery in which threat or use of force is involved. Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and
simple assault. Total crimes include violent crimes and theft. “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from
school. In 2005, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. For more information, please see appendix A.
Population sizes for students ages 12–18 are 23,325,000 in 1995; 24,614,000 in 1999; 24,315,000 in 2001; 25,684,000 in 2003; and 25,811,000 in 2005.

The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995, and 1997, Asian students and Pacific
Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing more than one race.
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 and 2002 (NCES 2006-030 and 2003-060) for students in
grades 9–12 are 13,093,000 students in 1993; 13,697,000 in 1995; 14,272,000 in 1997; 14,623,000 in 1999; 15,061,000 in 2001; 15,723,000 in 2003; and 16,286,000 (projected) in 2005.

The questionnaire wording for possession of a knife or sharp object differed between survey administrations. In 1999–2000 and 2005–06, the question asked about possession of a knife
or sharp object. In 2003–04, the question was changed to refer to possession of a knife or sharp object with intent to harm.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At school” was defined for respondents to include activities
that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to respond only for those
times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified otherwise. Population size of public schools is 82,000 in 1999–
2000, 80,500 in 2003–04, and 83,200 in 2005–06. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Estimates of number of incidents and schools are rounded to the nearest 100.

Theft/larceny (taking things worth over $10 without personal confrontation) was defined for respondents as “the unlawful taking of another person’s property without personal confrontation,
threat, violence, or bodily harm. Included are pocket picking, stealing a purse or backpack (if left unattended or no force was used to take it from owner), theft from a building, theft from a
motor vehicle or of motor vehicle parts or accessories, theft of bicycles, theft from vending machines, and all other types of thefts.”

Other incidents include possession of a firearm or explosive device, possession of a knife or sharp object, distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol, and vandalism.

These estimates exclude data from the 73 schools that did not report estimates of student race/ethnicity.

Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers and aides. The total number
of FTE teachers and aides is a combination of the full-time and part-time teachers and aides, including special education teachers and aides, with an adjustment for part-time status.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At school” was defined for respondents to include
activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to respond only
for those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified otherwise. Population size is 83,200 public schools.
Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Estimates of number of incidents and schools are rounded to the nearest 100.

These estimates exclude data from the 73 schools that did not report estimates of student race/ethnicity.

Violent incidents include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, threat of physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, and robbery
with or without a weapon.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At school” was defined for respondents to include
activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to respond only
for those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified otherwise. Population size is 83,200 public schools.

Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers and aides. The total number
of FTE teachers and aides is a combination of the full-time and part-time teachers and aides, including special education teachers and aides, with an adjustment for part-time status.

Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 8. Middle schools are defined as schools in
which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. High schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9.
Combined schools include all other combinations of grades, including K–12 schools.

Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, and, from 2003 onward, more than one race. For this report, non-Hispanic students who identified themselves as
more than one race were included in the Other category. Respondents who identified themselves as being of Hispanic origin are classified as Hispanic, regardless of their race. Due to
changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.
NOTE: All gangs, whether or not they are involved in violent or illegal activity, are included. “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and
from school. In 2005, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. For more information, please see appendix A.
Population sizes for students ages 12–18 are 24,315,000 in 2001; 25,684,000 in 2003; and 25,811,000 in 2005.

The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995, and 1997, Asian students and Pacific
Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing more than one race.
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 and 2002 (NCES 2006-030 and 2003-060) for students in
grades 9–12 are 13,093,000 students in 1993; 13,697,000 in 1995; 14,272,000 in 1997; 14,623,000 in 1999; 15,061,000 in 2001; 15,723,000 in 2003; and 16,286,000 (projected) in 2005.

Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, and, from 2003 onward, more than one race. For this report, non-Hispanic students who identified themselves as
more than one race were included in the Other category. Respondents who identified themselves as being of Hispanic origin are classified as Hispanic, regardless of their race. Due to
changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. Hate-related refers to derogatory terms used by
others in reference to students’ personal characteristics. In 2005, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. For
more information, please see appendix A. Population sizes for students ages 12–18 are 24,614,000 in 1999; 24,315,000 in 2001; 25,684,000 in 2003; and 25,811,000 in 2005.

In the School Crime Supplement (SCS) questionnaire, students were asked if they had been the target of hate-related words at school. Students who indicated that they had been called a
hate-related word were asked to choose the specific characteristics that the hate-related word targeted. Students were allowed to choose more than one characteristic. If a student chose
more than one characteristic, he or she is counted once under the “total” category. Therefore, the total percentage of students who reported being called a hate-related word is less than the
sum of the students’ individual characteristics.

Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, and more than one race. For this report, non-Hispanic students who identified themselves as more than one race
were included in the Other category. Respondents who identified themselves as being of Hispanic origin are classified as Hispanic, regardless of their race.
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. In 2005, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES
statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. For more information, please see appendix A. Population size for students ages 12–18 is 25,811,000 in 2005. Location totals
may sum to more than 100 because students could have been bullied in more than one location.

The public sector includes public, public charter, and Bureau of Indian Education school teachers.

Substantial improvements in geocoding technology and changes in the Office of Management and Budget’s definition of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas allow for more precision
in describing an area. Comparisons with earlier years are not possible.
NOTE: Teachers who taught only prekindergarten students are excluded. Population sizes for teachers are 2,623,000 in 1987–88; 2,905,000 in 1990–91; 2,930,000 in 1993–94; 3,452,000
in 1999–2000; and 3,704,000 in 2003–04.

The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995, and 1997, Asian students and Pacific
Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing more than one race.
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are simply asked how many times in the last 12
months they have been in a physical fight. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 and 2002 (NCES 2006-030 and 2003-060) for students in grades 9–12 are
13,093,000 students in 1993; 13,697,000 in 1995; 14,272,000 in 1997; 14,623,000 in 1999; 15,061,000 in 2001; 15,723,000 in 2003; and 16,286,000 (projected) in 2005.

The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995, and 1997, Asian students and Pacific
Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing more than one race.
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are simply asked how many days they carried a
weapon during the past 30 days. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 and 2002 (NCES 2006-030 and 2003-060) for students in grades 9–12 are 13,093,000
students in 1993; 13,697,000 in 1995; 14,272,000 in 1997; 14,623,000 in 1999; 15,061,000 in 2001; 15,723,000 in 2003; and 16,286,000 (projected) in 2005.

NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are simply asked how many days they carried a
weapon during the past 30 days. The estimate for the United States is drawn from a nationally representative sample of schools and is not the aggregate of participating states. Each state
estimate is based on a sample that is representative of that state. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 (NCES 2006-030) for students in grades 9–12 are 15,723,000

NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are simply asked how many days did they have
at least one drink of alcohol during the past 30 days. The estimate for the United States is drawn from a nationally representative sample of schools and is not the aggregate of participating
states. Each state estimate is based on a sample that is representative of that state. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 (NCES 2006-030) for students in grades 9–12
are 15,723,000 in 2003 and 16,286,000 (projected) in 2005.

The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995, and 1997, Asian students and Pacific
Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing more than one race.
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” is not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students are simply asked how many times during the
past 30 days they used marijuana. Population sizes from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2005 and 2002 (NCES 2006-030 and 2003-060) for students in grades 9–12 are 13,093,000
students in 1993; 13,697,000 in 1995; 14,272,000 in 1997; 14,623,000 in 1999; 15,061,000 in 2001; 15,723,000 in 2003; and 16,286,000 (projected) in 2005.

American Indian includes Alaska Native, Black includes African American, Pacific Islander includes Native Hawaiian, and Hispanic includes Latino. Respondents who identified
themselves as being of Hispanic origin are classified as Hispanic, regardless of their race.

Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, and, from 2003 onward, more than one race. For this report, non-Hispanic students who identified themselves as
more than one race were included in the Other category. Respondents who identified themselves as being of Hispanic origin are classified as Hispanic, regardless of their race. Due to
changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. For the 2001 survey, the wording was changed
from “attack or harm” to “attack or threat of attack.” Includes students who reported that they sometimes or most of the time feared being victimized in this way. Fear of attack away from
school was not collected in 1995. In 2005, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. For more information,
please see appendix A. Population sizes for students ages 12–18 are 23,325,000 in 1995; 24,614,000 in 1999; 24,315,000 in 2001; 25,684,000 in 2003; and 25,811,000 in 2005.

These estimates exclude data from the 73 schools that did not report estimates of student race/ethnicity.

Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers and aides. The total number
of FTE teachers and aides is a combination of the full-time and part-time teachers and aides, including special education teachers and aides, with an adjustment for part-time status.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. Respondents were instructed to respond only for those times
that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified otherwise. Population size is 83,200 public schools.

NOTE: Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and completed thefts except motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include
robbery in which threat or use of force is involved. Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and
simple assault. Total crimes include violent crimes and theft. “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from
school. In 2005, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. For more information, please see appendix A.

NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At school” was defined for respondents to include
activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to respond only
for those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified otherwise. Population size is 83,200 public schools.

NOTE: All gangs, whether or not they are involved in violent or illegal activity, are included. “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and
from school. In 2005, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. For more information, please see appendix A.
Population sizes for students ages 12–18 are 24,315,000 in 2001; 25,684,000 in 2003; and 25,811,000 in 2005.

NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. For the 2001 survey, the wording was changed
from “attack or harm” to “attack or threat of attack.” Includes students who reported that they sometimes or most of the time feared being victimized in this way. Fear of attack away from
school was not collected in 1995. In 2005, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. For more information,
please see appendix A. Population sizes for students ages 12–18 are 23,325,000 in 1995; 24,614,000 in 1999; 24,315,000 in 2001; 25,684,000 in 2003; and 25,811,000 in 2005.

† Not applicable.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. Serious disciplinary actions include removals with no
continuing services for at least the remainder of the school year, transfers to specialized schools for disciplinary reasons, and out-of-school suspensions lasting 5 or more days, but less than
the remainder of the school year. Respondents were instructed to respond only for those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session,
unless the survey specified otherwise. Population sizes of public schools are 82,000 in 1999–2000, 80,500 in 2003–04, and 83,200 in 2005–06. Standard errors of number of actions are
rounded to the nearest 10.

TECHNICAL NOTES

GENERAL INFORMATION
The indicators in this report are based on information drawn from a variety of
independent data sources, including national surveys of students, teachers, and
principals, and data collections from federal departments and agencies, including the
Bureau of Justice Statistics, the National Center for Education Statistics, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each data
source has an independent sample design, data collection method, and questionnaire
design or is the result of a universe data collection. Universe data collections include a
census of all known entities in a speciﬁc universe (e.g., all deaths occurring on school
property). Readers should be cautious when comparing data from different sources.
Differences in sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and question phrasing
can all affect the comparability of results. For example, some questions from different
surveys may appear the same, but were asked of different populations of students (e.g.,
students ages 12–18 or students in grades 9–12); in different years; about experiences
that occurred within different periods of time (e.g., in the past 30 days or during the
past 12 months); or at different locations (e.g., in school or anywhere).
All comparisons described in this report are statistically signiﬁcant at the .05 level.
Estimates displayed in the text, ﬁgures, and tables are rounded from original estimates,
not from a series of roundings.
The following is a description of data sources, accuracy of estimates, and statistical
procedures used in this report.

School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study (SAVD)
The School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study (SAVD) is an epidemiological
study developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in conjunction with
the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice. SAVD seeks

to describe the epidemiology of school-associated violent deaths, identify common
features of these deaths, estimate the rate of school-associated violent death in the
United States, and identify potential risk factors for these deaths. The surveillance
system includes descriptive data on all school-associated violent deaths in the United
States, including all homicides, suicides, and unintentional ﬁrearm-related deaths where
the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary
school, while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at such a school, or
while attending or on the way to or from an ofﬁcial school-sponsored event. Victims of
such events include nonstudents as well as students and staff members. SAVD includes
descriptive information about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). The SAVD
Surveillance System has collected data from July 1, 1992, through the present.
SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and collect data on school-associated violent
deaths. Cases are initially identiﬁed through a search of the Lexis/Nexis newspaper and
media database. Then police ofﬁcials are contacted to conﬁrm the details of the case
and to determine if the event meets the case deﬁnition. Once a case is conﬁrmed, a
police ofﬁcial and a school ofﬁcial are interviewed regarding details about the school,
event, victim(s), and offender(s). A copy of the full police report is also sought for each
case. The information obtained on schools includes school demographics, attendance/
absentee rates, suspension/expulsions and mobility, school history of weapon-carrying
incidents, security measures, violence prevention activities, school response to the event,
and school policies about weapon carrying. Event information includes the location of
injury, the context of injury (while classes were being held, during break, etc.), motives
for injury, method of injury, and school and community events happening around the
time period. Information obtained on victim(s) and offender(s) includes demographics,
circumstances of the event (date/time, alcohol or drug use, number of persons involved),
types and origins of weapons, criminal history, psychological risk factors, school-related
problems, extracurricular activities, and family history, including structure and stressors.
One hundred ﬁve school-associated violent deaths were identiﬁed from July 1, 1992–
June 30, 1994 (Kachur et al. 1996). A more recent report from this data collection
identiﬁed 253 school-associated violent deaths between July 1, 1994–June 30, 1999
(Anderson et al. 2001). Other publications from this study have described how the
number of events changes during the school year (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention 2001), the source of the ﬁrearms used in these events (Reza et al. 2003),
and suicides that were associated with schools (Kauffman et al. 2004). The interviews
conducted on cases between July 1, 1994 and June 30, 1999 achieved a response rate
of 97 percent for police ofﬁcials and 78 percent for school ofﬁcials. The SAVD data
are considered preliminary until interviews with school and law enforcement ofﬁcials
have been completed. The details learned during the interviews can occasionally
change the classiﬁcation of a case. For additional information about SAVD, contact:

Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR)
The Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), which are a part of the Uniform Crime
Reporting (UCR) program, provide incident-level information on criminal homicides
including situation (number of victims to number of offenders); the age, sex, and race
of victims and offenders; types of weapons used; circumstances of the incident; and the
relationship of the victim to the offender. The data are provided monthly to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) by local law enforcement agencies participating in the
FBI’s UCR program. The data include murders and non-negligent manslaughters in the
United States from January 1976–December 2005; that is, negligent manslaughters and
justiﬁable homicides have been eliminated from the data. Based on law enforcement
agency reports, the FBI estimates that 594,277 murders were committed from 1976
to 2005. Agencies provided detailed information on 538,210 victims and 597,359
offenders.
About 91 percent of homicides are included in the SHR. However, adjustments can be
made to the weights to correct for missing reports. Estimates from the SHR used in this
report were generated by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) using a weight developed
by BJS that reconciles the counts of SHR homicide victims with those in the UCR for
the 1992 through 2005 data years. The weight is the same for all cases for a given year.
The weight represents the ratio of the number of homicides reported in the UCR to the
number reported in the SHR. For additional information about SHR, contact:

Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System Fatal
(WISQARS™ Fatal)
WISQARS Fatal provides mortality data related to injury. The mortality data reported
in WISQARS Fatal come from death certiﬁcate data reported to the National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data include
causes of death reported by attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners. It
also includes demographic information about decedents reported by funeral directors,
who obtain that information from family members and other informants. NCHS

collects, compiles, veriﬁes, and prepares these data for release to the public. The data
provide information about what types of injuries are leading causes of deaths, how
common they are, and who they affect. These data are intended for a broad audience—
the public, the media, public health practitioners and researchers, and public health
ofﬁcials—to increase their knowledge of injury.
WISQARS Fatal mortality reports provide tables of the total numbers of injury-related
deaths and the death rates per 100,000 U.S. population. The reports list deaths
according to cause (mechanism) and intent (manner) of injury by state, race, Hispanic
origin, sex, and age groupings. For more information on WISQARS Fatal, contact:

National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), administered for the U.S. Bureau
of Justice Statistics by the U.S. Census Bureau, is the nation’s primary source of
information on crime and the victims of crime. Initiated in 1972 and redesigned in
1992, the NCVS collects detailed information annually on the frequency and nature
of the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, theft,
household burglary, and motor vehicle theft experienced by Americans and their
households each year. The survey measures crimes reported to police as well.
Readers should note that in 2003, in accordance with changes to the Ofﬁce of
Management and Budget’s standards for the classiﬁcation of federal data on race and
ethnicity, the NCVS item on race/ethnicity was modiﬁed. A question on Hispanic origin
is followed by a question on race. The new race question allows the respondent to
choose more than one race and delineates Asian as a separate category from Native
Hawaiian or Other Paciﬁc Islander. Analysis conducted by the Demographic Surveys
Division at the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the new race question had very
little impact on the aggregate racial distribution of the NCVS respondents, with one
exception. There was a 1.6 percentage point decrease in the percentage of respondents
who reported themselves as White. Due to changes in race/ethnicity categories,
comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.
The number of NCVS eligible households in 2005 was about 42,500. They were
selected using a stratiﬁed, multistage cluster design. In the ﬁrst stage, the primary
sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties or groups of counties, were selected.
In the second stage, smaller areas, called Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected
from each sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs, clusters of four households,

called segments, were selected for interview. At each stage, the selection was done
proportionate to population size in order to create a self-weighting sample. The final
sample was augmented to account for housing units constructed after the decennial
Census. Within each sampled household, U.S. Census Bureau personnel interviewed
all household members age 12 and older to determine whether they had been
victimized by the measured crimes during the 6 months preceding the interview.
The first NCVS interview with a housing unit is conducted in person. Subsequent
interviews are conducted by telephone, if possible. About 67,000 persons age 12
and older are interviewed each 6 months. Households remain in the sample for 3
years and are interviewed seven times at 6-month intervals. The initial interview at
each sample unit is used only to bound future interviews to establish a time frame
to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered in these subsequent interviews. After their
seventh interview, households are replaced by new sample households. The NCVS
has consistently obtained a response rate of over 90 percent at the household level.
The completion rates for persons within households were about 84 percent. Thus, final
response rates were about 77 percent in 2005. Weights were developed to permit
estimates for the total U.S. population 12 years and older. For more information about

School Crime Supplement (SCS)
Created as a supplement to the NCVS and codesigned by the National Center for
Education Statistics and Bureau of Justice Statistics, the School Crime Supplement
(SCS) survey was conducted in 1989, 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 to collect
additional information about school-related victimizations on a national level. This
report includes data from the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 collections. The
1989 data are not included in this report as a result of methodological changes to the
NCVS and SCS. The survey was designed to assist policymakers as well as academic
researchers and practitioners at the federal, state, and local levels so that they can
make informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The SCS asks students a
number of key questions about their experiences with and perceptions of crime and
violence that occurred inside their school, on school grounds, on a school bus, or on
the way to or from school. Additional questions not included in the NCVS were also
added to the SCS, such as those concerning preventive measures used by the school,
students’ participation in after school activities, students’ perceptions of school rules,

the presence of weapons and gangs in school, the presence of hate-related words and
grafﬁti in school, student reports of bullying and reports of rejection at school, and the
availability of drugs and alcohol in school, as well as attitudinal questions relating to
fear of victimization and avoidance behavior at school.
In all SCS survey years, the SCS was conducted for a 6-month period from January–
June in all households selected for the NCVS (see discussion above for information
about the NCVS sampling design and changes to the race/ethnicity item made for 2003
onward). It should be noted that the initial NCVS interview is included in the SCS
data collection. Within these households, the eligible respondents for the SCS were
those household members who had attended school at any time during the 6 months
preceding the interview, were enrolled in grades 6–12, and were not home schooled.
The age range of students covered in this report is 12–18 years of age. Eligible
respondents were asked the supplemental questions in the SCS only after completing
their entire NCVS interview.
The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 was calculated
by using NCVS incident variables appended to the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005
SCS data ﬁles. The NCVS type of crime variable was used to classify victimizations
of students in the SCS as serious violent, violent, or theft. The NCVS variables asking
where the incident happened and what the victim was doing when it happened
were used to ascertain whether the incident happened at school. For prevalence of
victimization, the NCVS deﬁnition of “at school” includes in the school building, on
school property, or on the way to or from school. Only incidents that occurred inside
the United States are included.
In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modiﬁed from previous collections in three
ways. First, in 1995 and 1999, “at school” was deﬁned for respondents as in the school
building, on the school grounds, or on a school bus. In 2001, the deﬁnition for “at
school” was changed to mean in the school building, on school property, on a school
bus, or going to and from school. This change was made to the 2001 questionnaire in
order to be consistent with the deﬁnition of “at school” as it is constructed in the NCVS
and was also used as the deﬁnition in 2003 and 2005. Cognitive interviews conducted
by the U.S. Census Bureau on the 1999 SCS suggested that modiﬁcations to the
deﬁnition of “at school” would not have a substantial impact on the estimates.
Second, the SCS questions pertaining to fear and avoidance were changed for the 2001
SCS survey. In 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2005, students were asked if they were fearful
or avoidant because they thought someone would “attack or harm” them. In 2001,
students were asked if they were fearful or avoidant because they thought someone
would “attack or threaten to attack” them. In the 1999 and 2001 SCS, students were
asked to exclude times they were at school or going to or from school in the question
about fear away from school. In 2003 and 2005, when asked about fear away from
school, students were asked to exclude times they were at school; however, in these
years the deﬁnition of “at school” included going to and from school. These changes
should be considered when making comparisons across survey years.

Third, the SCS question pertaining to gangs changed beginning with the 2001 SCS.
The introduction and deﬁnition of gangs as well as the placement of the item in the
questionnaire changed in the 2001 SCS. Because of these changes, the reader should
be cautioned not to compare results from 2001 (presented in this report) with estimates
of gang presence in 1995 and 1999 (presented in previous editions of this report).
In 2005, the SCS instrument was modiﬁed again. In this year, the SCS question(s)
pertaining to bullying changed. In 1999, 2001, and 2003, students were asked a single
bullying question. The 2005 SCS included a series of questions about bullying. Because
of substantive changes in questionnaire wording, comparisons between the 2005 SCS
bullying indicator and all other survey years should be made with caution.
Total victimization is a combination of violent victimization and theft. If the student
reported an incident of either violent or theft victimization or both, he or she is
counted as having experienced “total” victimization. Serious violent crimes include
rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes include serious
violent crimes and simple assault. Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all
burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and completed thefts except
motor vehicle thefts.
A total of 9,728 students participated in the 1995 SCS, 8,398 in 1999, 8,374 in 2001,
7,152 in 2003, and 6,297 in 2005. In the 2005 SCS, the household completion rate
was 91 percent. In the 1995, 1999, 2001 and 2003 SCS, the household completion
rates were 95 percent, 94 percent, 93 percent, and 92 percent, respectively; and the
student completion rates were 78 percent, 78 percent, 77 percent, and 70 percent,
respectively. For the 2005 SCS, the student completion rate was 62 percent.
Thus, the overall unweighted SCS response rate (calculated by multiplying the
household completion rate by the student completion rate) was 74 percent in 1995,
73 percent in 1999, 72 percent in 2001, 64 percent in 2003, and 56 percent in
2005. Response rates for most survey items were high—typically over 95 percent of
all eligible respondents. The weights were developed to compensate for differential
probabilities of selection and nonresponse. The weighted data permit inferences about
the eligible student population who were enrolled in schools in 1995, 1999, 2001,
2003, and 2005.
Due to the low unit response rate in 2005, a unit nonresponse bias analysis was
commissioned. There are two types of nonresponse: unit and item nonresponse. Unit
response rates indicate how many sampled units have completed interviews. Because
interviews with students could only be completed after households had responded
to NCVS, the unit completion rate for SCS reﬂects both the household interview
completion rate and the student interview completion rate.
Nonresponse can greatly affect the strength and application of survey data by leading
to an increase in variance as a result of a reduction in the actual size of the sample and
can produce bias if the nonrespondents have characteristics of interest that are different

Appendix A: Technical Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

from the respondents. Furthermore, imputation, a common recourse to nonresponse,
can lead to the risk of underestimating the sampling error if imputed data are treated as
though they were observed data.
In order for response bias to occur, respondents must have different response rates
and responses to particular survey variables. The magnitude of unit nonresponse bias
is determined by the response rate and the differences between respondents and
nonrespondents on key survey variables. Although the bias analysis cannot measure
response bias since SCS is a sample survey and it is not known how the population
would have responded, the SCS sampling frame has four key student or school
characteristic variables for which data is known for respondents and nonrespondents:
sex, race/ethnicity, household income, and urbanicity, all of which are associated with
student victimization. To the extent that there are differential responses by respondents
in these groups, nonresponse bias is a concern.
The analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias for the race, household
income, and urbanicity variables. White (non-Hispanic) and Other (non-Hispanic)
respondents had higher response rates than Black (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic
respondents. Respondents from households with an income of $35,000–49,999
and $50,000 or more had higher response rates than those from households with
incomes of less than $7,500, $7,500–14,999, $15,000–24,999 and $25,000–34,999.
Respondents who live in urban areas had lower response rates than those who
live in rural or suburban areas. Although the extent of nonresponse bias cannot be
determined, weighting adjustments, which corrected for differential response rates,
should have reduced the problem. For more information about SCS, contact:

Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)
The National School-Based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) is one component of
the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), an epidemiological surveillance
system developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to monitor
the prevalence of youth behaviors that most inﬂuence health.1 The YRBS focuses on
priority health-risk behaviors established during youth that result in the most signiﬁcant
mortality, morbidity, disability, and social problems during both youth and adulthood.
This report uses 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 YRBS data.

The YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling design to produce a nationally
representative sample of students in grades 9–12 in the United States. The target
population consisted of all public and private school students in grades 9–12 in the 50
states and the District of Columbia. The ﬁrst-stage sampling frame included selecting
primary sampling units (PSUs) from strata formed on the basis of urbanization and the
relative percentage of Black and Hispanic students in the PSU. These PSUs are either
large counties or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. At the second stage, schools
were selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size.
Schools with substantial numbers of Black and Hispanic students were sampled at
relatively higher rates than all other schools. The ﬁnal stage of sampling consisted of
randomly selecting within each chosen school at each grade 9–12 one or two intact
classes of a required subject, such as English or social studies. All students in selected
classes were eligible to participate. Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300,
13,600, 15,200, and 13,900 students participated in the 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999,
2001, 2003, and 2005 surveys, respectively.
The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993 survey, 60 percent for the 1995
survey, 69 percent for the 1997 survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey, 63 percent for
the 2001 survey, 67 percent for the 2003 survey, and 67 percent for the 2005 survey.
NCES standards call for response rates of 85 percent or better for cross-sectional
surveys, and bias analyses are required by NCES when that percentage is not achieved.
For YRBS data, a full nonresponse bias analysis has not been done because the data
necessary to do the analysis are not available. The weights were developed to adjust
for nonresponse and the oversampling of Black and Hispanic students in the sample.
The ﬁnal weights were constructed so that only weighted proportions of students (not
weighted counts of students) in each grade matched national population projections.
Where YRBS data are presented, accurate national population projections are provided
from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2002 and 2005 (U.S. Department of Education
2003, 2006).
State level data were downloaded from the Youth Online: Comprehensive Results web
page (http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/yrbss/). Each state and local school-based YRBS employs
a two-stage, cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in
grades 9–12 in their jurisdiction. All except a few state and local samples include only
public schools, and each local sample includes only schools in the funded school
district (e.g., San Diego Uniﬁed School District) rather than in the entire city (e.g.,
greater San Diego area).
In the ﬁrst sampling stage in all except a few states and districts, schools are selected
with probability proportional to school enrollment size. In the second sampling stage,
intact classes of a required subject or intact classes during a required period (e.g.,
second period) are selected randomly. All students in sampled classes are eligible
to participate. Certain states and districts modify these procedures to meet their
individual needs. For example, in a given state or district, all schools, rather than a
sample of schools, might be selected to participate. State and local surveys that have

a scientiﬁcally selected sample, appropriate documentation, and an overall response
rate greater than or equal to 60 percent are weighted. The overall response rate reﬂects
the school response rate multiplied by the student response rate. These three criteria
are used to ensure that the data from those surveys can be considered representative
of students in grades 9–12 in that jurisdiction. A weight is applied to each record to
adjust for student nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade, sex, and
race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore, weighted estimates are representative of
all students in grades 9–12 attending schools in each jurisdiction. Surveys that do not
have an overall response rate of greater than or equal to 60 percent and do not have
appropriate documentation are not weighted and are not included in this report.
In 2005, a total of 40 states and 21 districts had weighted data. In sites with weighted
data, the student sample sizes for the state and local YRBS ranged from 942 to 9,708.
School response rates ranged from 72 to 100 percent, student response rates ranged
from 61 to 93 percent, and overall response rates ranged from 60 to 85 percent.
Readers should note that reports of these data published by the CDC do not include
percentages where the denominator includes less than 100 unweighted cases. However,
NCES publications do not include percentages where the denominator includes less
than 30 unweighted cases. Therefore, estimates presented here may not appear in CDC
publications of YRBS estimates and are considered unstable by CDC standards.
In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Ofﬁce of Management and Budget’s
standards for the classiﬁcation of federal data on race and ethnicity, the YRBS item on
race/ethnicity was modiﬁed. The version of the race and ethnicity question used in
1993, 1995, and 1997 was:
How do you describe yourself?
A. White—not Hispanic
B. Black—not Hispanic
C. Hispanic or Latino
D. Asian or Paciﬁc Islander
E. American Indian or Alaskan Native
F. Other
The version used in 1999, 2001, 2003, and in the 2005 state and local surveys was:
How do you describe yourself? (Select one or more responses.)
A. American Indian or Alaska Native
B. Asian
C. Black or African American
D. Hispanic or Latino
E. Native Hawaiian or Other Paciﬁc Islander
F. White

In the 2005 national survey, race/ethnicity was computed from two questions: 1) “Are
you Hispanic or Latino?” (response options were “yes” and “no”), and 2) “What is your
race?” (response options were “American Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian,” “Black or
African American,” “Native Hawaiian or Other Paciﬁc Islander,” or “White”). For the
second question, students could select more than one response option. For this report,
students were classiﬁed as “Hispanic” if they answered “yes” to the ﬁrst question,
regardless of how they answered the second question. Students who answered “no”
to the ﬁrst question and selected more than one race/ethnicity in the second category
were classiﬁed as “More than one race.” Students who answered “no” to the ﬁrst
question and selected only one race/ethnicity were classiﬁed as that race/ethnicity.
Race/ethnicity was set to missing for students who did not answer the ﬁrst question
(176 cases) or for students who answered “no” to the ﬁrst question but did not answer
the second question (48 cases).
The questions used in 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 result in the possibility of
respondents marking more than one category. While more accurately reﬂecting
respondents’ racial and ethnic identity, the new item cannot be directly compared to
responses to the old item. Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found that allowing
students to select more than one response to the race/ethnicity question on the YRBS
had only a minimal effect on reported race/ethnicity among high school students. CDC
is examining the effect of using a two-question format to assess race/ethnicity in the
2005 national YRBS.

Schools and Stafﬁng Survey (SASS)
This report draws upon data on teacher victimization from the Schools and Stafﬁng
Survey (SASS), which provides national- and state-level data on public schools and
national- and afﬁliation-level data on private schools. The 1993–94, 1999–2000,
and 2003–04 SASS were collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and sponsored by
the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). SASS consists of four sets of
linked surveys, including surveys of schools, the principals of each selected school,
a subsample of teachers within each school, and public school districts. In 1993–94,
there were two sets of teacher surveys, public and private school teachers. In 1999–

2000, there were four sets of teacher surveys, public, private, public charter, and
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) school teachers. In 2003–04, there were three sets of
teacher surveys, public (including public charter), private, and BIA. For this report, BIA
and public charter schools are included with public schools.
The public school sampling frames for the 1993–94, 1999–2000, and 2003–04 SASS
were created using the 1991–92, 1997–98, and 2001–02 NCES Common Core of Data
(CCD) Public School Universe Files, respectively. In SASS, a school was deﬁned as
an institution or part of an institution that provides classroom instruction to students;
has one or more teachers to provide instruction; serves students in one or more of
grades 1–12 or the ungraded equivalent and is located in one or more buildings. It was
possible for two or more schools to share the same building; in this case they were
treated as different schools if they had different administrations (i.e., principals). Since
CCD and SASS differ in scope and their deﬁnition of a school, some records were
deleted, added, or modiﬁed in order to provide better coverage and a more efﬁcient
sample design for SASS. Data were collected by multistage sampling, which began
with the selection of schools.
This report uses 1993–94, 1999–2000, and 2003–04 SASS data. Approximately 10,000
public schools and 3,300 private schools were selected to participate in the 1993–94
SASS, 11,100 public schools (9,900 public schools, 100 BIA-funded schools, and 1,100
charter schools) and 3,600 private schools were selected to participate in the 1999–
2000 SASS, and 10,400 public schools (10,200 public schools and 200 BIA-funded
schools) and 3,600 private schools were selected to participate in the 2003–04 SASS.
Within each school, teachers selected were further stratiﬁed into one of ﬁve teacher
types in the following hierarchy: (1) Asian or Paciﬁc Islander; (2) American Indian,
Aleut, or Eskimo; (3) teachers who teach classes designed for students with limited
English proﬁciency; (4) teachers in their ﬁrst, second, or third year of teaching; and (5)
teachers not classiﬁed in any of the other groups. Within each teacher stratum, teachers
were selected systematically with equal probability. In 1993–94, approximately 57,000
public school teachers and 11,500 private school teachers were sampled. In 1999–
2000, 56,300 public school teachers, 500 BIA teachers, 4,400 public charter school
teachers, and 10,800 private school teachers were sampled. In 2003–04, 52,500 public
school teachers, 700 BIA teachers, and 10,000 private school teachers were sampled.
This report focuses on responses from teachers. The overall weighted response rate for
public school teachers in 1993–94 was 88 percent. In 1999–2000, the overall weighted
response rates were 77 percent for public school teachers, and 86 and 72 percent for
BIA and public charter school teachers, respectively (which are included with public
school teachers for this report). In 2003–2004, the overall weighted response rates were
76 percent for public school teachers and 86 percent for BIA-funded school teachers
(who are included with public school teachers). For private school teachers, the overall
weighted response rates were 80 percent, 67 percent, and 70 percent in 1993–94,
1999–2000, and 2003–04, respectively. Values were imputed for questionnaire items
that should have been answered but were not. For additional information about SASS,

School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)
The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) was conducted by NCES in the
spring of the 2005–06 school year. SSOCS focuses on incidents of speciﬁc crimes and
offenses and a variety of speciﬁc discipline issues in public schools. It also covers
characteristics of school policies, school violence prevention programs and policies,
and school characteristics that have been associated with school crime. The survey was
conducted with a nationally representative sample of regular public primary, middle,
high, and combined schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
The sampling frame for the 2005–06 SSOCS was constructed from the 2003–04 NCES
Common Core of Data (CCD) Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe File. The
CCD is an annual national database of all public K–12 schools and school districts.
Certain types of schools were excluded from the CCD Public School Universe File in
order to meet the sampling needs of SSOCS, including those in the outlying U.S. areas2
and Puerto Rico; overseas Department of Defense schools; newly closed schools, home
schools, and schools with high grades of kindergarten or lower; special education,
vocational, or alternative schools; schools sponsored by the Bureau of Indian Affairs;
ungraded schools; and “intermediate units”3 in California and Pennsylvania. The
sample was stratiﬁed by instructional level, type of locale (e.g., city, urban fringe,
etc.), and enrollment size. Within the primary strata, schools were also sorted by
geographic region and by percentage of minority enrollment. The sample was then
allocated to the primary strata in rough proportion to the square root of the total sum
of individual enrollments of schools within the stratum. A total of 3,565 schools were
selected for the study. In March 2006, questionnaires were mailed to school principals,
who were asked to complete the survey or to have it completed by the person
most knowledgeable about discipline issues at the school. A total of 2,724 schools
completed the survey. The weighted overall response rate was 80.6 percent, and
weighted item nonresponse rates ranged from 0.0–27.7 percent. A nonresponse bias
analysis was conducted on the 13 items with weighted item nonresponse rates above
15 percent, and the detected bias was not deemed problematic enough to suppress any
items from the data ﬁle. Weights were developed to adjust for the variable probabilities
of selection and differential nonresponse and can be used to produce national
estimates for regular public schools in the 2005–06 school year. For information on the
1999–2000 and 2003–04 iterations, see Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2006.

“U.S. outlying areas” include the following: America Samoa, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

ACCURACY

OF

ESTIMATES

The accuracy of any statistic is determined by the joint effects of nonsampling and
sampling errors. Both types of error affect the estimates presented in this report.
Several sources can contribute to nonsampling errors. For example, members of the
population of interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling frame; sampled
members refuse to answer some of the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all
of the survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse); mistakes are made during data
editing, coding, or entry; the responses that respondents provide differ from the “true”
responses; or measurement instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail to measure
the characteristics they are intended to measure. Although nonsampling errors due to
questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of
sample weights and imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors or gauging
the effects of these errors is usually difﬁcult.
Sampling errors occur because observations are made on samples rather than on
entire populations. Surveys of population universes are not subject to sampling errors.
Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat from those that would have been
obtained by a complete census of the relevant population using the same survey
instruments, instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a measure
of the variation due to sampling; it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained
in a particular sample. In addition, the standard errors for two sample statistics can
be used to estimate the precision of the difference between the two statistics and to
help determine whether the difference based on the sample is large enough so that it
represents the population difference.
Most of the data used in this report were obtained from complex sampling designs
rather than a simple random design. The features of complex sampling require different
techniques to calculate standard errors than are used for data collected using a simple
random sampling. Therefore, calculation of standard errors requires procedures that
are markedly different from the ones used when the data are from a simple random
sample. The Taylor series approximation technique or the balanced repeated replication
(BRR) method was used to estimate most of the statistics and their standard errors in
this report. Figure A.3 lists the various methods used to compute standard errors for
different datasets.
Standard error calculation for data from the National Crime Victimization Survey and
the School Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series approximation method

using PSU and strata variables available from each dataset. For statistics based on
all years of NCVS data, standard errors were derived from a formula developed by
the U.S. Census Bureau, which consists of three generalized variance function (gvf)
constant parameters that represent the curve ﬁtted to the individual standard errors
calculated using the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique. The formulas used to
compute the adjusted standard errors associated with percentages or population counts
can be found in ﬁgure A.3.
The coefﬁcient of variation (Cv) represents the ratio of the standard error to the mean.
As an attribute of a distribution, the Cv is an important measure of the reliability and
accuracy of an estimate. In this report, the Cv was calculated for all estimates, and in
cases where the Cv was at least 30 percent the estimates were noted with a ! symbol
(interpret data with caution). In cases where the Cv was greater than 50 percent, the
estimate was determined not to meet reporting standards and was suppressed.

STATISTICAL PROCEDURES
The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical signiﬁcance to ensure that
the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Unless
otherwise noted, all statements cited in the report are statistically signiﬁcant at the
.05 level. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being
analyzed and the nature of the statement being tested. The primary test procedure
used in this report was the student’s t statistic, which tests the difference between
two sample estimates, for example, between males and females. The formula used to
compute the t statistic is as follows:

t=

E1 – E2

(1)

se1 2 + se22
where E1 and E2 are the estimates to be compared and se1 and se2 are their
corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for independent
estimates. When the estimates are not independent (for example, when comparing a
total percentage with that for a subgroup included in the total), a covariance term (i.e.,
2 * r * se1 * se2) must be subtracted from the denominator of the formula:
t=

E1 – E2

(2)

se1 2 + se22 – (2 * r * se1 * se2)
where r is the correlation coefﬁcient. Once the t value was computed, it was compared
with the published tables of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. For
this report, an alpha value of .05 was used, which has a t value of 1.96. If the t value
was larger than 1.96, then the difference between the two estimates is statistically
signiﬁcant at the 95 percent level.

A linear trend test was used when differences among percentages were examined
relative to ordered categories of a variable, rather than the differences between
two discrete categories. This test allows one to examine whether, for example, the
percentage of students using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the
percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased
(or decreased) with their age. Based on a regression with, for example, student’s age
as the independent variable and whether a student was physically attacked as the
dependent variable, the test involves computing the regression coefﬁcient (b) and its
corresponding standard error (se). The ratio of these two (b/se) is the test statistic t. If
t is greater than 1.96, the critical value for one comparison at the .05 alpha level, the
hypothesis that there is a linear relationship between student’s age and being physically
attacked is not rejected.
Some comparisons among categories of an ordered variable with three or more
levels involved a test for a linear trend across all categories, rather than a series of
tests between pairs of categories. In this report, when differences among percentages
were examined relative to a variable with ordered categories, Analysis of Variance
(ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. To do
this, ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts corresponding to successive
levels of the independent variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors (that
is, standard errors that were calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance
between the means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used to partition the total
sum of squares into within- and between-group sums of squares. These were used to
create mean squares for the within- and between-group variance components and their
corresponding F statistics, which were then compared with published values of F for a
signiﬁcance level of .05. Signiﬁcant values of both the overall F and the F associated
with the linear contrast term were required as evidence of a linear relationship
between the two variables.

already mentioned,) did you have something stolen from you or were you attacked or threatened by
(exclude telephone threats):
Someone at work or school?
Incidents involving forced or unwanted sexual acts are often difficult to talk about. (Other than any
incidents already mentioned,) have you been forced or coerced to engage in unwanted sexual
activity by:
Someone you didn’t know before
A casual acquaintance
Or someone you know well?

Response categories

I’m going to read some examples that will give you an idea of the kinds of crimes this study covers.
As I go through them, tell me if any of these happened to you in the last 6 months. That is since
(date). Was something belonging to you stolen, such as:
Things that you carry, like luggage, a wallet, purse, briefcase, book

Standard errors of crime level data and aggregated crime rates
per 1,000 persons were calculated using three generalized
variance function (gvf) constant parameters (denoted as a, b,
and c) and formulas published in the Methodology Section
of Criminal Victimization in the United States—Statistical
Tables (NCJ184938) on the Bureau of Justice Statistics website:
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cvusst.htm.
The formula used to calculate standard errors (q) of crime level data
(x) is:
2
3/ 2
aax
x 2 +? bx
bx+?cxc x 3/2

where x is the estimated number of crimes of interest, and a, b, and c
are gvf constant parameters.
The formula used to calculate standard errors of aggregated crime
rates per 1,000 persons (r) is:

(1000 −- rr)
) / y/y
+?crcr
( 1000

where r is the aggregate crime rate (i.e., 1000 * total crimes /
total population), y is the aggregated base population, and b
and c are gvf constant parameters. The three gvf constant
parameters associated with the specific years are:

Cluster sampling Cluster sampling is a technique in which the sampling of respondents or
subjects occurs within clusters or groups. For example, selecting students by sampling
schools and the students that attend that school.
Crime Any violation of a statute or regulation or any act that the government has
determined is injurious to the public, including felonies and misdemeanors. Such
violation may or may not involve violence, and it may affect individuals or property.
Incident A speciﬁc criminal act or offense involving one or more victims and one or more
offenders.
Multistage sampling A survey sampling technique in which there is more than one wave
of sampling. That is, one sample of units is drawn, and then another sample is drawn
within that sample. For example, at the ﬁrst stage, a number of Census blocks may
be sampled out of all the Census blocks in the United States. At the second stage,
households are sampled within the previously sampled Census blocks.
Prevalence The percentage of the population directly affected by crime in a given period.
This rate is based upon speciﬁc information elicited directly from the respondent
regarding crimes committed against his or her person, against his or her property, or
against an individual bearing a unique relationship to him or her. It is not based upon
perceptions and beliefs about, or reactions to, criminal acts.
School An education institution consisting of one or more of grades K through 12.
School crime Any criminal activity that is committed on school property.
School year The 12-month period of time denoting the beginning and ending dates for
school accounting purposes, usually from July 1 through June 30.
Stratiﬁcation A survey sampling technique in which the target population is divided
into mutually exclusive groups or strata based on some variable or variables (e.g.,
metropolitan area) and sampling of units occurs separately within each stratum.
Unequal probabilities A survey sampling technique in which sampled units do not have
the same probability of selection into the sample. For example, the investigator may
oversample minority students in order to increase the sample sizes of minority students.
Minority students would then be more likely than other students to be sampled.

National Crime Victimization Survey
Aggravated assault Attack or attempted attack with a weapon, regardless of whether or not
an injury occurs, and attack without a weapon when serious injury results.
At school (students) Inside the school building, on school property (school parking area,
play area, school bus, etc.), or on the way to or from school.
At school (teachers) Inside the school building, on school property (school parking area,
play area, school bus, etc.), at worksite, or while working. For thefts, “while working”
was not considered, since thefts of teachers’ property kept at school can occur when
teachers are not present.
Rape Forced sexual intercourse including both psychological coercion as well as physical
force. Forced sexual intercourse means vaginal, anal, or oral penetration by the
offender(s). Includes attempts and verbal threats of rape. This category also includes
incidents where the penetration is from a foreign object, such as a bottle.

includes a variety of localities, ranging from sparsely populated rural areas to cities
with populations of less than 50,000.
Serious violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated assault.
Sexual assault A wide range of victimizations, separate from rape or attempted rape. These
crimes include attacks or attempted attacks generally involving unwanted sexual
contact between the victim and offender. Sexual assault may or may not involve force
and includes such things as grabbing or fondling. Sexual assault also includes verbal
threats.
Simple assault Attack without a weapon resulting either in no injury, minor injury, or
an undetermined injury requiring less than 2 days of hospitalization. Also includes
attempted assault without a weapon.
Suburban A county or counties containing a central city, plus any contiguous counties that
are linked socially and economically to the central city. On the data tables, suburban

Victimization A crime as it affects one individual person or household. For personal crimes,
the number of victimizations is equal to the number of victims involved. The number
of victimizations may be greater than the number of incidents because more than one
person may be victimized during an incident.
Victimization rate A measure of the occurrence of victimizations among a speciﬁc
population group.
Violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, or simple assault.

School Crime Supplement
At school In the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to or from
school.
Gang Street gangs, ﬁghting gangs, crews, or something else. Gangs may use common
names, signs, symbols, or colors. All gangs, whether or not they are involved in violent
or illegal activity, are included.
Serious violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated assault.
Total victimization Combination of violent victimization and theft. If a student reported an
incident of either type, he or she is counted as having experienced any victimization. If
the student reported having experienced both, he or she is counted once under “total
victimization.”
Violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, or simple assault.

Youth Risk Behavior Survey
Illegal drugs Examples of illegal drugs were marijuana, cocaine, inhalants, steroids, or
prescription drugs without a doctor’s permission, heroin, and methamphetamines.

Suburban school is located inside a MSA, but outside the “central city.”
Urban school is located inside a MSA and inside the “central city.”
Weapon Examples of weapons appearing in the questionnaire include guns, knives, and
clubs.

Schools and Stafﬁng Survey
City A territory inside an urbanized area (deﬁned as densely settled “cores” with
populations of 50,000 or more of Census-deﬁned blocks with adjacent densely settled
surrounding areas) and inside a principal city (deﬁned as a city that contains the
primary population and economic center of a metropolitan statistical area, which, in
turn, is deﬁned as one or more contiguous counties that have a “core” area with a large
population nucleus and adjacent communities that are highly integrated economically
or socially with the core).

grades taught, checked: (1) only “ungraded” and was designated as an elementary
teacher on the list of teachers provided by the school; (2) 6th grade or lower or
“ungraded,” and no grade higher than 6th; (3) 6th grade or lower and 7th grade
or higher, and reported a primary assignment of prekindergarten, kindergarten, or
general elementary; (4) 7th and 8th grades only, and reported a primary assignment
of prekindergarten, kindergarten, or general elementary; (5) 6th grade or lower and

Instructional level Instructional levels divide teachers into elementary or secondary
based on a combination of the grades taught, main teaching assignment, and the
structure of the teacher’s class(es). Those with only ungraded classes are categorized as
elementary level teachers if their main assignment is early childhood/prekindergarten or
elementary, or they teach either special education in a self-contained classroom or an
elementary enrichment class. All other teachers with ungraded classes are classiﬁed as
secondary level. Among teachers with regularly graded classes, in general, elementary
level teachers teach any of grades prekindergarten through 5th; report an early
childhood/prekindergarten, elementary, self-contained special education, or elementary
enrichment main assignment; or are those whose preponderance of grades taught are
kindergarten through 6th. In general, secondary level teachers instruct any of grades
7 through 12 but usually no grade lower than 5th. They also teach more of grades 7
through 12 than lower level grades.

surrounding areas) or urban cluster (deﬁned as densely settled “cores” with populations
between 25,000 and 50,000 of Census-deﬁned blocks with adjacent densely settled
surrounding areas).
Secondary school A school in which the lowest grade is greater than or equal to grade 7
and the highest grade is less than or equal to grade 12.

general elementary; (3) 9th grade or higher, or 9th grade or higher and “ungraded”; (4)
7th and 8th grades only, and reported a primary assignment other than prekindergarten,
kindergarten, general elementary, or special education; (5) 7th and 8th grades only, and
reported a primary assignment of special education and was designated as a secondary
