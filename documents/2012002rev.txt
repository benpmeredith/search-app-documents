The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is the primary federal entity for collecting, analyzing,
and reporting data related to education in the United States and other nations. It fulfills a congressional mandate to collect, collate, analyze, and report full and complete statistics on the condition of education in the
United States; conduct and publish reports and specialized analyses of the meaning and significance of such
statistics; assist state and local education agencies in improving their statistical systems; and review and report
on education activities in other countries.
The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) is the primary federal entity for collecting, analyzing, publishing, and
disseminating statistical information about crime, its perpetrators and victims, and the operation of the justice
system at all levels of government. These data are critical to federal, state, and local policymakers in combating
crime and ensuring that justice is both efficient and evenhanded.

Executive Summary
Introduction

Key Findings

Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for
teaching and learning, free of crime and violence. Any
instance of crime or violence at school not only affects
the individuals involved, but also may disrupt the
educational process and affect bystanders, the school
itself, and the surrounding community (Henry 2000).

Preliminary data show that there were 33 schoolassociated violent deaths1 from July 1, 2009, through
June 30, 2010 (Indicator 1). In 2010, among students
ages 12–18, there were about 828,000 nonfatal
victimizations at school,2 which include 470,000
victims of theft3 and 359,000 victims of violence4
(simple assault and serious violence5) (Indicator 2). In
2009–10, about 74 percent of public schools recorded
one or more violent incidents6 of crime, 16 percent
recorded one or more serious violent incidents,7 and
44 percent recorded one or more thefts8 (Indicator
6). The following key findings are drawn from each
section of the report.

Establishing good indicators of the current state
of school crime and safety across the nation and
regularly updating and monitoring these indicators
is important in ensuring the safety of our nation’s
students. This is the aim of Indicators of School Crime
and Safety.
This report is the fourteenth in a series of annual
publications produced jointly by the National
Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Institute of
Education Sciences (IES), in the U.S. Department
of Education, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS) in the U.S. Department of Justice. This report
presents the most recent data available on school
crime and student safety. The indicators in this report
are based on information drawn from a variety of
data sources, including national surveys of students,
teachers, and principals. Sources include results from
a study of violent deaths in schools, sponsored by
the U.S. Department of Education and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention; the National
Crime Victimization Survey and School Crime
Supplement to the survey, sponsored by the BJS and
NCES, respectively; the Youth Risk Behavior Survey,
sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention; and the Schools and Staffing Survey and
School Survey on Crime and Safety, both sponsored
by NCES. The most recent data collection for each
indicator varied by survey, from 2007 to 2010. Each
data source has an independent sample design, data
collection method, and questionnaire design, or is the
result of a universe data collection. All comparisons
described in this report are statistically significant at
the .05 level. Additional information about methodology and the datasets analyzed in this report may
be found in appendix A.
This report covers topics such as victimization, teacher
injury, bullying, school conditions, fights, weapons,
availability and student use of drugs and alcohol,
and student perceptions of personal safety at school.
Indicators of crime and safety are compared across
different population subgroups and over time. Data
on crimes that occur away from school are offered as
a point of comparison where available.

Violent Deaths

weapon two or three times, 1 percent were
threatened or injured with a weapon four to
eleven times, and 1 percent were threatened or
injured with a weapon twelve or more times14
(Indicator 4).

During the school year 2008–09 there were
1,579 homicides among school-age youth ages
5–18, of which 17 occurred at school. During the

about 828,000 nonfatal victimizations at school,9
including 470,000 thefts10 and 359,000 violent
victimizations,11 91,400 of which were serious
violent victimizations12 (Indicator 2).

In 2010, a greater number of students ages 12–18
experienced total victimizations (theft and violent
crime) at school than away from school. That year,
32 victimizations per 1,000 students occurred at
school, and 26 victimizations per 1,000 students
occurred away from school (Indicator 2).

The total crime victimization rate of students ages
12–18 at school declined from 43 victimizations
per 1,000 students in 2009 to 32 victimizations
per 1,000 students in 2010 (Indicator 2).

During the 2009–10 school year, 85 percent of
public schools recorded that one or more crime
incidents had taken place at school,15 amounting
to an estimated 1.9 million crimes (table 6.1). This
figure translates to a rate of 40 crimes per 1,000
public school students enrolled in 2009–10.
During the same year, 60 percent of public
schools reported a crime incident that occurred
at school to the police, amounting to 689,000
crimes—or 15 crimes per 1,000 public school
students enrolled (Indicator 6).

 “On school property” was not defined for survey
respondents.
14
  Subtotals do not add to total due to rounding.
15
 “At school” was defined for respondents to include
activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds,
on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored
events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include
incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school
hours or when school activities or events were in session.

for 5 days or more, 20 percent were transfers to
specialized schools, and 6 percent were removals
with no services for the remainder of the school
year (Indicator 19).

The percentage of public schools taking at least
one serious disciplinary action declined over
time between 1999–2000 (54 percent) and
2009–10 (39 percent); and the percentage was
lower in 2009–10 than in 2007–08 (46 percent).

“Avoided school activities” includes avoiding any
(extracurricular) activities, skipping class, or staying home
from school. In 2007 and 2009, the survey wording was
changed from “any extracurricular activities” to “any activities.”
Please use caution when comparing changes in this item over
time. Avoiding one or more places in school includes avoiding
the entrance, any hallways or stairs, parts of the cafeteria,
restrooms, and other places inside the school building.

  Readers should note that this indicator relies on student
reports of security measures and provides estimates based
on students’ awareness of the measure rather than on
documented practice. Selected security measures include, for
example, controlling access during school hours, drug testing
and prohibiting tobacco use, requiring ID badges, metal
detectors, and sweeps and technology. For a more detailed
list of selected security measures and a summary of the use
of various security measures as reported by schools please see
Indicator 20.

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2011 provides
the most recent national indicators on school crime
and safety. The information presented in this report
is intended to serve as a reference for policymakers
and practitioners so that they can develop effective programs and policies aimed at violence and
school crime prevention. Accurate information
about the nature, extent, and scope of the problem
being addressed is essential for developing effective
programs and policies.
This is the fourteenth edition of Indicators of School
Crime and Safety, a joint publication of the Bureau
of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES). This report provides
detailed statistics to inform the nation about current
aspects of crime and safety in schools.
The 2011 edition of Indicators of School Crime and
Safety includes the most recent available data, compiled
from a number of statistical data sources supported
by the federal government. Such sources include
results from a study of violent deaths in schools,
sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education

and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC); the National Crime Victimization Survey and
School Crime Supplement to the survey, sponsored
by the BJS and NCES, respectively; the Youth Risk
Behavior Survey, sponsored by the CDC; and the
Schools and Staffing Survey and School Survey on
Crime and Safety, both sponsored by NCES.
The entire report is available on the Internet
(http://nces.ed.gov/programs/crimeindicators/
crimeindicators2011/). The Bureau of Justice Statistics
and the National Center for Education Statistics
continue to work together in order to provide timely
and complete data on the issues of school-related
violence and safety.

Introduction

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2011

1

Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for
teaching and learning free of crime and violence.
Any instance of crime or violence at school not only
affects the individuals involved but also may disrupt
the educational process and affect bystanders, the
school itself, and the surrounding community
(Henry 2000). For both students and teachers,
victimization at school can have lasting effects. In
addition to experiencing loneliness, depression, and
adjustment difficulties (Crick and Bigbee 1998;
Crick and Grotpeter 1996; Nansel et al. 2001;
Prinstein, Boergers, and Vernberg 2001; Storch et
al. 2003), victimized children are more prone to
truancy (Ringwalt, Ennett, and Johnson 2003),
poor academic performance (MacMillan and Hagan
2004; Wei and Williams 2004), dropping out of
school (Beauvais et al. 1996; MacMillan and Hagan
2004), and violent behaviors (Nansel et al. 2003).
For teachers, incidents of victimization may lead to
professional disenchantment and even departure from
the profession altogether (Karcher 2002; Smith and
Smith 2006).
For parents, school staff, and policymakers to effectively address school crime, they need an accurate
understanding of the extent, nature, and context
of the problem. However, it is difficult to gauge the
scope of crime and violence in schools given the large
amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of
extreme school violence. Measuring progress toward
safer schools requires establishing good indicators of
the current state of school crime and safety across
the nation and regularly updating and monitoring
these indicators; this is the aim of Indicators of School
Crime and Safety.

Purpose and Organization of This Report
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2011 is the
fourteenth in a series of reports produced since 1998
by the National Center for Education Statistics
(NCES) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) that
present the most recent data available on school crime
and student safety. The report is not intended to be
an exhaustive compilation of school crime and safety
information, nor does it attempt to explore reasons for
crime and violence in schools. Rather, it is designed
to provide a brief summary of information from an
array of data sources and to make data on national
school crime and safety accessible to policymakers,
educators, parents, and the general public.
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2011 is
organized into sections that delineate specific
concerns to readers, starting with a description of the
most serious violent crimes. The sections cover Violent
2

Introduction

Deaths; Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization;
School Environment; Fights, Weapons, and Illegal
Substances; Fear and Avoidance; and Discipline,
Safety, and Security Measures. Each section contains
a set of indicators that, taken together, aim to describe
a distinct aspect of school crime and safety. Where
available, data on crimes that occur outside of school
grounds are offered as a point of comparison.1
Supplemental tables for each indicator provide more
detailed breakouts and standard errors for estimates.
Standard errors for the estimate tables are available
online. A glossary of terms and a reference section
appear at the end of the report.
This year’s report contains updated data for thirteen
indicators: violent deaths at school and away from
school (Indicator 1), incidence of victimization at
school and away from school (Indicator 2), prevalence
of victimization at school (Indicator 3), violent and
other crime incidents at public schools and those
reported to the police (Indicator 6), discipline
problems reported by public schools (Indicator 7),
students’ reports of gangs at school (Indicator 8),
students’ reports of being called hate-related words
and seeing hate-related graffiti (Indicator 10), bullying
at school and cyber-bullying anywhere (Indicator 11),
students’ perceptions of personal safety at school and
away from school (Indicator 17), students’ reports of
avoiding school activities or specific places in school
(Indicator 18), serious disciplinary actions taken by
public schools (Indicator 19), safety and security
measures taken by public schools (Indicator 20), and
students’ reports of safety and security measures
observed at school (Indicator 21).
Also found in this year’s report are references to recent
publications relevant to each indicator that the reader
may want to consult for additional information or
analyses. These references can be found in the “For
more information” sidebars at the bottom of each
indicator.

Data
The indicators in this report are based on information
drawn from a variety of independent data sources,
including national surveys of students, teachers, and
principals and universe data collections from federal
departments and agencies, including BJS, NCES, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. Each data source
has an independent sample design, data collection

number of hours they spend elsewhere.

method, and questionnaire design, or is the result of
a universe data collection.
The combination of multiple, independent sources
of data provides a broad perspective on school crime
and safety that could not be achieved through any
single source of information. However, readers should
be cautious when comparing data from different
sources. While every effort has been made to keep key
definitions consistent across indicators, differences in
sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and
question phrasing can all affect the comparability
of results. For example, both Indicators 20 and 21
report data on selected security and safety measures
used in schools. Indicator 20 uses data collected from
a survey of public school principals about safety and
security practices used in their schools during the
2009–10 school year. The schools range from primary
through high schools. Indicator 21, however, uses
data collected from 12- through 18-year-old students
residing in a sample of households. These students
were asked whether they observed selected safety and
security measures in their school in 2009, but they
may not have known whether, in fact, the security
measure was present. In addition, different indicators
contain various approaches to the analysis of school
crime data and, therefore, will show different perspectives on school crime. For example, both Indicators
2 and 3 report data on theft and violent crime at
school based on the National Crime Victimization
Survey and the School Crime Supplement to that
survey, respectively. While Indicator 2 examines the
number of incidents of crime, Indicator 3 examines
the percentage or prevalence of students who reported
victimization. Table A provides a summary of some
of the variations in the design and coverage of sample
surveys used in this report.
Several indicators in this report are based on selfreported survey data. Readers should note that
limitations inherent to self-reported data may affect
estimates (Addington 2005; Cantor and Lynch 2000).
First, unless an interview is “bounded” or a reference
period is established, estimates may include events
that exceed the scope of the specified reference period.
This factor may artificially increase reported incidents
because respondents may recall events outside of the
given reference period. Second, many of the surveys
rely on the respondent to “self-determine” a condition.
This factor allows the respondent to define a situation
based upon his or her own interpretation of whether
the incident was a crime or not. On the other hand,
the same situation may not necessarily be interpreted
in the same way by a bystander or the perceived
offender. Third, victim surveys tend to emphasize
crime events as incidents that take place at one point in

time. However, victims can often experience a state of
victimization in which they are threatened or victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally, respondents may
recall an event inaccurately. For instance, people may
forget the event entirely or recall the specifics of the
episode incorrectly. These and other factors may affect
the precision of the estimates based on these surveys.
Data trends are discussed in this report when possible.
Where trends are not discussed, either the data
are not available in earlier surveys or the wording
of the survey question changed from year to year,
eliminating the ability to discuss any trend.
Where data from samples are reported, as is the
case with most of the indicators in this report, the
standard error is calculated for each estimate provided
in order to determine the “margin of error” for these
estimates. The standard errors of the estimates for
different subpopulations in an indicator can vary
considerably and should be taken into account when
making comparisons. With the exception of Indicator
2, in this report, in cases where the standard error
was at least 30 percent of the associated estimate, the
estimates were noted with a “!” symbol (Interpret data
with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this
estimate is 30 percent or greater). In Indicator 2, the
“!” symbol cautions the reader that estimates marked
indicate that the reported statistic was based on fewer
than 10 cases. With the exception of Indicator 2,
in cases where the standard error was greater than
50 percent of the associated estimate, the estimate
was suppressed (Reporting standards not met. Either
there are too few cases or the coefficient of variation
(CV) is 50 percent or greater). See appendix A for
more information.
The comparisons in the text have been tested for
statistical significance to ensure that the differences
are larger than might be expected due to sampling
variation. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited
in the report are statistically significant at the .05
level. Several test procedures were used, depending
upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature
of the statement being tested. The primary test
procedure used in this report was Student’s t statistic,
which tests the difference between two sample
estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for
multiple comparisons. Linear trend tests were used
when differences among percentages were examined
relative to interval categories of a variable, rather than
the differences between two discrete categories. This
test allows one to examine whether, for example, the
percentage of students who reported using drugs
increased (or decreased) over time or whether the
percentage of students who reported being physically

attacked in school increased (or decreased) with age.
When differences among percentages were examined
relative to a variable with ordinal categories (such as
grade), analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test
for a linear relationship between the two variables.
Although percentages reported in the tables are generally rounded to one decimal place (e.g., 76.5 percent),
percentages reported in the text and figures are
generally rounded from the original number to whole

numbers (with any value of 0.50 or above rounded
to the next highest whole number). While the data
labels on the figures have been rounded to whole
numbers, the graphical presentation of these data
is based on the unrounded estimates shown in the
corresponding table.
Appendix A of this report contains descriptions of all
the datasets used in this report and a discussion of
how standard errors were calculated for each estimate.

Indicator 1
Violent Deaths at School and Away From School
Over all available survey years, the percentage of youth homicides occurring at school remained at less than
2 percent of the total number of youth homicides, and the percentage of youth suicides occurring at school
remained at less than 1 percent of the total number of youth suicides.
Violent deaths at schools are rare but tragic events
with far-reaching effects on the school population
and surrounding community. In this indicator, data
on school-associated violent deaths are collected using
the School Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance
Study (SAVD). The most recent data collected for
this survey cover the time period from July 1, 2009,
through June 30, 2010. During this time period, there
were 33 school-associated violent deaths in elementary
and secondary schools in the United States (figure 1.1
and tables 1.1 and 1.2). A school-associated violent
death is defined as “a homicide, suicide, or legal
intervention (involving a law enforcement officer),
in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of
a functioning elementary or secondary school in the
United States.” Victims of school-associated violent
deaths include not only students and staff members,
but also others who are not students or staff members,
such as parents. School-associated violent deaths
include those that occurred while the victim was
on the way to or returning from regular sessions at
school or while the victim was attending or traveling
to or from an official school-sponsored event. Of the
33 student, staff, and nonstudent school-associated
violent deaths occurring between July 1, 2009, and
June 30, 2010, 25 were homicides, 5 were suicides,
and 3 were legal interventions2 (table 1.2). Data for
school-associated violent deaths for the 2009–10
school year are preliminary.
Data on homicides and suicides at-school and awayfrom-school were drawn from a number of sources.
The ‘away-from-school’ data were included in order
to compare ‘at-school’ and ‘away from school’. The
availability for data on homicides and data on suicides

 A death that occurred where the decedent was fatally
injured by a law enforcement officer or other peace officer
(persons with specified legal authority to use deadly force),
acting in the line of duty.

at-school and away-from-school differs in time period.
The most recent data available for total suicides of
school-age youth only (youth ages 5–18) are for the
2008 calendar year; the most recent data available
for total homicides of youth ages 5–18 are for the
2008–09 school year.3 During 2008–09, there were
1,579 homicides of youth ages 5–18 (figure 1.2 and
table 1.1). During the 2008 calendar year, there were
1,344 suicides of youth ages 5–18. From July 1, 2009,
through June 30, 2010, there were 17 homicides and
1 suicide of school-age youth at school (figure 1.1 and
table 1.1). During the 2009–10 school year, there was
approximately one homicide or suicide of a school-age
youth at school per 2.7 million students enrolled.4
The percentage of youth homicides occurring at
school remained at less than 2 percent of the total
number of youth homicides over all available survey
years, even though the absolute number of homicides
of school-age youth at school varied to some degree
across the years (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). Between
the 1992–93 and 2009–10 school years, from 1 to 10
school-age youth committed suicide at school each
year, with no consistent pattern of increase or decrease
in the number of suicides. The percentage of youth
suicides occurring at school remained at less than 1
percent of the total number of youth suicides over all
available survey years.

3

  Data on total suicides are available only by calendar year,
whereas data on suicides and homicides at school and data
on total homicides are available by school year. Due to these
differences in reference periods, please use caution when
comparing violent deaths at school to total violent deaths.
Data for total suicides (2009) and total homicides (2009–
10) are not yet available.
4
  The total number of students enrolled in prekindergarten
through 12th grade during the 2009–10 school year was
49,373,307 (Snyder and Dillow 2011).

This indicator has been updated to include 2009–10 data. For more information: Tables 1.1 and 1.2 and Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (2008), (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5702a1.htm).

A school-associated violent death is defined as “a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal
injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States” while the victim was on the way to or from
regular sessions at school or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims include students, staff
members, and others who are not students, from July 1, 1992, through June 30, 2010.
NOTE: “At school” includes on school property, on the way to or from regular sessions at school, and while attending or traveling to or from a schoolsponsored event. Estimates were revised and may differ from previously published data.
SOURCE: Data on homicides and suicides of youth ages 5–18 at school and total school-associated violent deaths are from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), 1992–2010 School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study (SAVD), partially funded by the U.S. Department of
Education, Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools, previously unpublished tabulation (July 2011).

Indicator 2
Incidence of Victimization at School and Away From School
Between 2009 and 2010, the violent victimization rate for students ages 12–18 at school declined from
20 per 1,000 students to 14 per 1,000 students.
Theft and violence both at school and while going
to and from school can affect the overall health and
well-being of adolescents, interfere with educational
goals, and stall normal healthy development
(Fredland 2008). This type of victimization can also
lead to higher-than-average rates of teacher turnover,
increases in student dropout rates, students changing
schools, principals and teachers retiring early,
increases in student fear of violence at school, and a
decline in learning (Crews, Crews, and Turner 2008).
In 2010, data from the National Crime Victimization
Survey 5 showed that more victimizations were
committed against students ages 12–18 at school than
away from school. Students ages 12–18 experienced
about 828,400 nonfatal victimizations (theft6 and
violent crime7) at school,8 compared to about 652,500
nonfatal victimizations away from school (table 2.1).9
These figures represent total crime victimization rates
of 32 crimes per 1,000 students at school and 26
victimizations per 1,000 students away from school.
For most years between 1992 and 2008, the rate of
theft at school among students ages 12–18 was higher
than the rate of theft away from school, but there
were no measurable differences between these rates in
either 2009 or 2010. Between 1992 and 2000, the rate
of violent victimization per 1,000 students away from
school was higher than the rate at school. In most
years since 2001, the rates of violent victimization

Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on similar
topics, the survey sources for these two indicators differ
with respect to time coverage and administration. For more
information on these two surveys, please see appendix A.

“Theft” includes attempted and completed purse-snatching,
completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed
thefts, excluding motor vehicle theft. Theft does not include
robbery, in which the threat or use of force is involved.
7
“Violent victimization” includes serious violent crimes and
simple assault.
8
“At school” includes inside the school building, on school
property, or on the way to or from school.
9
“Students” refers to youth ages 12–18 whose educational
attainment did not exceed grade 12 at the time of the survey.
An uncertain percentage of these persons may not have
attended school during the survey reference period. These
data do not take into account the number of hours that
students spend at school or away from school.

per 1,000 students away from school have not
been measurably different than the rates at school.
However, in 2009 the rate of violent victimization
per 1,000 students at school was higher than the rate
for students away from school. In 2010, there was no
measurable difference in the violent victimization
rates at and away from school (11 per 1,000 students
away from school and 14 per 1,000 at school).
Rates of serious violent victimization10 against
students ages 12–18 at school were generally lower
than those occurring away from school in each
survey year between 1992 and 2008; in both 2009
and 2010, there were no measurable differences in
the rates. In 2010, students experienced 4 serious
violent victimizations per 1,000 students at school
and 5 serious violent victimizations per 1,000 students
away from school.
Between 1992 and 2010, the total victimization rates
for students ages 12–18 generally declined both at
and away from school. This pattern also held for
thefts, violent victimizations, and serious violent
victimizations (figure 2.1).
In the most recent period between 2009 and 2010,
the total victimization rate against students ages
12–18 at school declined from 43 victimizations per
1,000 students to 32 per 1,000, and the rate of violent
victimization at school declined from 20 per 1,000
students to 14 per 1,000. There were no measurable
differences in the rates of theft and serious violent
victimization against students at school between
2009 and 2010. Away from school, total victimization
rates declined from 33 per 1,000 students in 2009
to 26 per 1,000 in 2010. Theft declined from 19
per 1,000 students in 2009 to 15 per 1,000 in 2010.
Violent and serious violent victimization rates away
from school were not measurably different between
2009 and 2010.

Serious violent victimization is also included in violent victimization.
NOTE: Due to changes in the sample design and survey methodology in the 2006 National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), use caution when
comparing 2006 estimates to other years. For more information, please see appendix A. “Serious violent victimization” includes rape, sexual assault,
robbery, and aggravated assault. “Violent victimization” includes serious violent crimes and simple assault. “Theft” includes purse-snatching,
pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, with the exception of motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which threat or
use of force is involved. Robbery is classified as a violent crime. “Total victimization” includes violent crimes and theft. “At school” includes inside the
school building, on school property, or on the way to or from school. Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on similar topics, the survey
sources for these two indicators differ with respect to time coverage and administration. For more information on these two surveys, please see
appendix A. Detail may not sum to total because students who reported more than one type of victimization were included in each, but only counted
once in the total.

The victimization rates for students in 2010 varied
according to student characteristics. No measurable
differences were found by age group (i.e., students
ages 12–14 vs. students ages 15–18) in the rates
of total victimization, theft, and serious violent
victimization at school (figure 2.2 and table 2.2).
However, the rates of violent victimization at school
were higher for younger students (ages 12–14) than
for older students (ages 15–18) (figure 2.2 and table
2.2). Violent victimization rates at school were 18 per
1,000 students ages 12–14, compared to 11 per 1,000
students ages 15–18.
Away from school, the rates of total victimization and
theft were lower for younger students (ages 12–14)
than for older students (ages 15–18) (figure 2.2 and
table 2.3). Total victimization rates away from school
were 20 per 1,000 students ages 12–14, compared to
31 per 1,000 students ages 15–18. Theft victimization
rates away from school were 10 per 1,000 students

12

Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization

ages 12–14, compared to 19 per 1,000 students ages
15–18. There were no measurable differences by
age group in the rates of violent and serious violent
victimization away from school.
No measurable differences were detected by sex
between the rates of total victimization, theft, and
serious violent victimizations either at or away
from school. Females had lower rates of violent
victimization (8 per 1,000) than males (14 per 1,000)
away from school in 2010. There were no measurable
differences between male and female rates of violent
victimization at school in 2010.
Students residing in urban and suburban areas had
higher rates of violent victimization at school than
those residing in rural areas. Violent victimization
rates were 18 per 1,000 students in urban areas and
14 per 1,000 in suburban areas, compared to 7 per
1,000 students residing in rural areas.

Indicator 3
Prevalence of Victimization at School
In 2009, approximately 4 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being victimized at school during the
previous 6 months. Three percent of students reported theft, 1 percent reported violent victimization, and
less than 1 percent reported serious violent victimization.
The School Crime Supplement11 collects data on
the percentage of students ages 12–18 who reported
criminal victimization at school12 during the previous
6 months. In addition to the total percentages reported
by students, victimization is also reported by type,
namely theft,13 violent victimization,14 and serious
violent victimization.15 Results from the most recent
data collection show that in 2009, approximately
4 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being
victimized at school during the previous 6 months.
Three percent of students reported theft, 1 percent
reported violent victimization, and less than 1 percent
reported serious violent victimization (figure 3.1 and
table 3.1).
Reports on the prevalence of victimization varied
in 2009 by student characteristics. Among students
ages 12–18, a higher percentage of male students (5
percent) than female students (3 percent) reported
being victimized at school during the previous 6
months. While a higher percentage of male students
reported theft (3 percent compared to 2 percent of
female students), no measurable differences were
detected by sex in the percentages reported by
students for violent type of victimization in 2009.

There were no measurable differences between the
percentages of White, Black, and Hispanic students
ages 12–18 who reported criminal victimization,
theft, and violent victimization at school in 2009.
About 4 percent each of White, Black, and Hispanic
students reported criminal victimization at school and
3 percent each reported theft. Two percent of Black
students and 1 percent each of White and Hispanic
students ages 12–18 reported violent victimization.
A higher percentage of 11th-graders (5 percent) than
12th-graders (2 percent) reported being victimized at
school during the previous 6 months in 2009. Three
percent of 7th-graders, 4 percent each of 6th-graders,
8th-graders, and 10th-graders, and 5 percent of 9thgraders reported being victimized at school. A lower
percentage of 8th-graders than 9th-graders (2 percent
vs. 5 percent) reported theft, and a lower percentage
of 12th-graders than 11th-graders (2 percent vs.
3 percent) reported theft in 2009.
No measurable differences were observed by
urbanicity in 2009 in the prevalence of victimization.
About 4 percent each of students ages 12–18 from
urban and suburban schools and 3 percent of students
from rural schools reported criminal victimization
at school. Differences were observed by school
type in the prevalence of victimization reported in
2009. Students attending public schools reported
being victimized at about twice the rate of students
attending private schools (4 percent vs. 2 percent).

Between 1995 and 2009, the total percentage of
students ages 12–18 who reported being victimized
at school during the previous 6 months, as well as the
percentages of students who reported theft, violent
victimization, and serious violent victimization,
decreased. A decrease between 1995 and 2009
in the percentage of students reporting criminal
victimization also occurred by some student and
school characteristics. For example, the percentage
of male students who reported being victimized at
school decreased by about half, from 10 percent in

Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization

1995 to 5 percent in 2009. Among female students,
the percentage who reported being victimized
decreased by about two thirds, from 9 percent in 1995
to 3 percent in 2009. For students attending both
public and private schools, the percentages of students
who reported victimization decreased. Ten percent of
public school students reported being victimized at
school in 1995, compared with 4 percent of public
school students in 2009. Similarly, about 7 percent
of private school students reported being victimized
in 1995, compared with 2 percent in 2009.

Indicator 4
Threats and Injuries With Weapons on School Property
From 1993 through 2009, the percentage of students who were threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property fluctuated between 7 and 9 percent.
Every year, some students are threatened or injured
with a weapon while they are on school property.
The percentage of students victimized in this way
provides a measure of how safe our schools are, and
if levels of safety in school have changed over time.
In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in
grades 9–12 were asked whether and how often they
had been threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property16 during the 12 months preceding
the survey. From 1993 through 2009, the percentage
of students who were threatened or injured with a
weapon fluctuated between 7 and 9 percent. For
example, in 2009, 8 percent of students reported
being threatened or injured with a weapon, such as
a gun, knife, or club, on school property (table 4.1).
Specifically, 3 percent of students were threatened
or injured with a weapon one time, 2 percent were
threatened or injured with a weapon two or three
times, 1 percent were threatened or injured with a
weapon four to eleven times, and 1 percent were
threatened or injured with a weapon twelve or more
times17 (figure 4.3 and table 4.2).
The likelihood of being threatened or injured with
a weapon on school property varied by student
characteristics, including sex and grade level. In
each survey year, a higher percentage of males than
females reported being threatened or injured with
a weapon on school property (table 4.1). In 2009,
the percentage of male students who reported being
threatened or injured in the past year was nearly twice
as high as the percentage of female students (10 and
5 percent, respectively). Generally, the percentage of
students who reported being threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property decreased with

grade level (figure 4.1 and table 4.1). For example, in
2009, a smaller percentage of 12th-graders (5 percent)
reported that they were threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property than the percentages of
9th-, 10th-, and 11th-graders (9, 8, and 8 percent,
respectively).
The percentage of students who reported being
threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property varied by race/ethnicity in 2009 (figure
4.2 and table 4.1). Specifically, smaller percentages
of White students and Asian students (6 and 5
percent, respectively) than American Indian/Alaska
Native students (16 percent), and Black students
and Hispanic students (9 percent each) reported
being threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property. The percentage of American Indian/Alaska
Native students who reported being threatened
or injured with a weapon was higher than the
percentages of Black students, Hispanic students,
and students of two or more races (9 percent). In
addition, higher percentages of Pacific Islander/Native
Hawaiian students and students of two or more races
(13 and 9 percent, respectively) than Asian students
reported being threatened or injured with a weapon.
In 2009, the percentage of students being threatened
or injured with a weapon on school property varied
among the 39 states for which data were available.
Among these states, the percentage of students who
reported being threatened or injured on school
property ranged from 6 percent in Indiana, Kansas,

Indicator 5
Teachers Threatened With Injury or Physically Attacked by Students
A greater percentage of teachers in city schools than teachers in suburban, town, or rural schools reported
being threatened with injury during the 2007–08 school year.
Students are not the only victims of intimidation or
violence in schools. Teachers are also subject to threats
and physical attacks, and students from their schools
sometimes commit these offenses. In the Schools and
Staffing Survey, teachers were asked whether they had
been threatened with injury or physically attacked by
a student from their school in the previous 12 months.
During the 2007–08 school year, a smaller percentage
of teachers, 7 percent, were threatened with injury
by a student from their school than in 1993–94 (12
percent) and 1999–2000 (9 percent), though this
percentage was not measurably different from the
percentage in 2003–04 (7 percent) (figure 5.1 and
table 5.1). The percentage of teachers reporting that
they had been physically attacked by a student from
their school, 4 percent, was not measurably different in
2007–08 than in any previous survey year (table 5.2).
A greater percentage of teachers in city schools than
teachers in suburban, town, or rural schools reported
being threatened with injury during the 2007–08
school year (figure 5.2 and table 5.1). Ten percent of
teachers in city schools were threatened with injury by
students, compared to 7 percent of teachers in town
schools and 6 percent each of teachers in suburban
and rural schools. A greater percentage of teachers
in city schools (5 percent) and suburban schools (4
percent) than teachers in rural schools (3 percent)
reported being physically attacked (table 5.2).
During 2007–08, teachers’ reports of being threatened
or physically attacked by students varied according
to the instructional level of their school. A greater
percentage of secondary school teachers (8 percent)
than elementary school teachers (7 percent) reported
being threatened with injury by a student, and this
pattern held for teachers in suburban schools as well
as for teachers in rural schools (table 5.1 and figure
5.2). The apparent difference in the percentage of
elementary and secondary teachers in city schools

who reported being threatened with injury was not
statistically significant. However, a greater percentage
of elementary school teachers (6 percent) reported
having been physically attacked than secondary
school teachers (2 percent), and this pattern held
true for teachers in city, suburban, town, and rural
schools (table 5.2).
A greater percentage of public than private school
teachers reported being threatened with injury (8 vs.
3 percent) or physically attacked (4 vs. 2 percent) by
students during 2007–08 (tables 5.1 and 5.2). Among
teachers in city schools, there were at least five times as
many public school teachers as private school teachers
who reported being threatened with injury (12 vs. 2
percent) and at least four times as many public school
teachers as private school teachers who reported being
physically attacked (6 vs. 1 percent).
In all survey years, a greater percentage of male
teachers reported having been threatened with
injury than female teachers (table 5.1). For example,
in 2007–08, 9 percent of male teachers reported
that they were threatened with injury by students,
compared to 7 percent of female teachers; this pattern
held true for teachers in city and suburban schools in
2007–08, as well.
Public school teachers’ reports of being threatened
with injury or physically attacked varied among the
states and the District of Columbia. During 2007–08,
the percentage of public school teachers who reported
being threatened with injury during the previous 12
months ranged from 3 percent in North Dakota to
17 percent in the District of Columbia (table 5.3),
and the percentage who reported being physically
attacked ranged from 2 percent in New Hampshire,
New Jersey, North Dakota, and Ohio to 8 percent
in Maryland (table 5.4).

Indicator 6
Violent and Other Crime Incidents at Public Schools, and Those
Reported to the Police
In 2009–10, about 74 percent of public schools recorded one or more violent incidents, 16 percent
recorded one or more serious violent incidents, and 44 percent recorded one or more thefts.
In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public
school principals were asked to provide the number
of violent incidents,18 serious violent incidents,19 thefts
of items valued at $10 or greater without personal
confrontation, and other incidents20 that occurred at
their school.21 Public school principals were also asked
to provide the number of incidents they reported to
the police. This indicator presents the percentage of
public schools that recorded one or more of these
specified crimes, the total number of these crimes
recorded, and the rate of crimes per 1,000 students.
These data are also presented for crimes that were
reported to the police.
In all survey years the percentage of public schools
that recorded incidents of crime was between 85
and 86 percent, with the exception of school year
2003–04. In 2003–04, the percentage of public
schools that recorded incidents of crime was 89
percent. Similarly, the percentage of public schools
that reported incidents of crime to the police was
between 60 and 62 percent in all survey years with
the exception of 2003–04, when 65 percent of public
schools reported one or more incidents to the police.
For the majority of types of crime, the percentages
of public schools recording incidents of crime or
18

 “Violent incidents” include rape, sexual battery other
than rape, physical attack or fight with or without a weapon,
threat of physical attack with or without a weapon, and
robbery with or without a weapon.
19
 “Serious violent incidents” include rape, sexual battery
other than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon,
threat of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or
without a weapon.
20
 “Other incidents” include possession of a firearm or
explosive device; possession of a knife or sharp object;
distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol;
vandalism; and inappropriate distribution, possession, or use
of prescription drugs.
21
 “At school” was defined for respondents to include
activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds,
on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored
events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include
incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school
hours, or when school activities or events were in session.

reporting incidents of crime to the police in 2009–10
were not measurably different from the percentages of
schools doing so in 2007–08. However, the percentage
of schools that recorded vandalism decreased from 49
percent in 2007–08 to 46 percent in 2009–10.
During the 2009–10 school year, 85 percent of public
schools recorded that one or more of these incidents
of violence, theft, or other crimes had taken place,
amounting to an estimated 1.9 million crimes (figure
6.1 and table 6.1). This figure translates to a rate of
approximately 40 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled
in 2009–10. During the same year, 60 percent of
schools reported one of the specified crimes to the
police, amounting to about 689,000 crimes—or 15
crimes per 1,000 students enrolled.
In 2009–10, a greater percentage of schools recorded
an incident of crime than reported an incident of
crime to the police. This pattern held true for violent
crimes, serious violent crimes, thefts, and other
crimes. Seventy-four percent of schools recorded one
or more violent incidents of crime (a rate of 25 crimes
per 1,000 students enrolled), 16 percent recorded one
or more serious violent incidents (a rate of 1 crime
per 1,000 students enrolled), 44 percent recorded one
or more thefts (a rate of 5 crimes per 1,000 students
enrolled), and 68 percent recorded one or more
other incidents (a rate of 9 crimes per 1,000 students
enrolled). In comparison, 40 percent of public schools
reported at least one violent incident to police (a rate
of 6 reported crimes per 1,000 students), 10 percent
reported at least one serious violent incident to
police (a rate of less than 1 percent reported crimes
per 1,000 students), 25 percent reported at least one
theft to police (a rate of 3 reported crimes per 1,000
students), and 46 percent reported one or more other
incidents to police (a rate of 6 reported crimes per
1,000 students).

The percentage of schools that recorded incidents
of violent crime, serious violent crime, theft, and
other incidents varied by school characteristics. For
example, by school level, primary schools recorded
lower percentages of these types of crimes than middle
schools and high schools: 64 percent of primary
schools recorded violent incidents of crime compared
with 91 percent each of middle schools and high
schools (figure 6.2 and table 6.2). A lower percentage
of primary schools recorded serious violent incidents
of crime (13 percent) than middle or high schools
(19 percent and 28 percent, respectively), a lower
percentage of primary schools recorded incidents of
theft (26 percent) than middle or high schools (65
percent and 83 percent), and a lower percentage of
primary schools recorded other incidents (57 percent)
than middle or high schools (82 percent and 92
percent).
A similar pattern was observed for public schools
that reported such incidents of violent crime, serious
violent crime, theft, and other incidents to the police.
The percentages of primary schools that reported
incidents of these types of crime to the police were
lower than for middle schools and high schools (figure
6.2 and table 6.3).

28

School Environment

Data on the number of crimes recorded and reported
by schools in 2009–10 were categorized by frequency
range as well. For example, 26 percent of schools
recorded zero violent crimes, and 19 percent of schools
recorded 20 or more violent crimes (figure 6.3 and
table 6.4). Sixty percent of schools did not report a
violent crime to the police, while 5 percent of schools
reported 20 or more violent crimes to the police. With
regard to serious violent crimes, 84 percent of schools
did not record a serious violent crime, and 2 percent
of schools recorded 10 or more such crimes. Ninety
percent of schools did not report a serious violent
crime to the police, and 1 percent of schools reported
10 or more serious violent crimes to the police (table
6.5). The number of crimes recorded by schools by
frequency range varied by school characteristics. A
larger percentage of city schools recorded 20 or more
violent incidents in 2009–10 than suburban schools
or rural schools (table 6.4). In 2009–10, this amounts
to about 25 percent of city schools recording 20 or
more violent incidents, compared with 19 percent
of suburban schools and 14 percent of rural schools.

Indicator 7
Discipline Problems Reported by Public Schools
During the 2009–10 school year, 23 percent of public schools reported that bullying occurred among
students on a daily or weekly basis, 9 percent reported student acts of disrespect for teachers other than
verbal abuse on a daily or weekly basis, and 5 percent reported that student verbal abuse of teachers
occurred on a daily or weekly basis. Sixteen percent reported gang activities during the school year.
In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school
principals were asked how often certain disciplinary
problems happened in their schools.22 This indicator
examines the daily or weekly occurrence of student
racial/ethnic tensions, bullying, sexual harassment of
other students, sexual harassment of other students
based on sexual orientation or gender identity, verbal
abuse of teachers, acts of disrespect for teachers other
than verbal abuse, and widespread disorder in the
classroom. It also looks at occurrences of gang and
cult or extremist group activities during the school
year. In the 2009–10 survey administration, schools
were also asked to report selected types of cyberbullying problems at school or away from school that
occurred daily or weekly.
During the 2009–10 school year, 23 percent of
public schools reported that bullying occurred
among students on a daily or weekly basis, and 9
percent reported student acts of disrespect for teachers
other than verbal abuse on a daily or weekly basis
(table 7.1). With regard to other discipline problems
reported as occurring at least once a week, 5 percent
of schools reported student verbal abuse of teachers,

and 3 percent each of reported student racial/ethnic
tensions, student sexual harassment of other students,
sexual harassment of other students based on sexual
orientation or gender identity, and widespread
disorder in classrooms. Sixteen percent of public
schools reported that gang activities had happened
at all during the 2009–10 school year and 2 percent
reported that cult or extremist activities had happened
at all during this period.
Discipline problems reported by public schools
varied by school characteristics. In 2009–10, a higher
percentage of city schools than rural schools and
suburban schools reported various types of discipline
problems (figure 7.1 and table 7.1). For example, 27
percent of city schools, compared with 21 percent of
rural schools and 20 percent of suburban schools,
reported that student bullying occurred at least once a
week. A greater percentage of city schools (28 percent)
than suburban schools and rural schools (15 percent
and 9 percent, respectively) reported any occurrence
of gang activities during the school year.
Indicator 7 continued on page 34.

“At school” was defined for respondents to include
activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds,
on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored
events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include
incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school
hours or when school activities or events were in session.

In 2009–10, the percentage of middle schools
reporting student racial and ethnic tension (5 percent)
was higher than the percentage of high schools (3
percent) and primary schools (2 percent) that reported
student racial and ethnic tension (table 7.1). Schools
with an enrollment size of 1,000 or more reported
higher percentages of student racial and ethnic
tension (6 percent) than schools with an enrollment
size of 500–999 or 300–499 (3 percent each).
In addition, 10 percent of schools where 76 percent or
more of the students were eligible for free or reducedprice lunch reported the daily or weekly occurrence
of student verbal abuse of teachers, compared to 1
percent of schools where 25 percent or less of the
students were eligible.23
The percentages of public schools that reported the
occurrence of student bullying, student verbal abuse
of teachers, and student acts of disrespect for teachers
other than verbal abuse were greater in 1999–2000
than in 2009–10. For example, in 1999–2000,
approximately 29 percent of public schools reported
student bullying, compared with 23 percent of public
schools that reported student bullying in 2009–10.
Eleven percent of schools reported that student acts
of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse
occurred at least once a week in 2007–08, higher
than the 9 percent in 2009–10 (table 7.2). The
percentage of public schools that reported widespread
disorder in the classrooms decreased from 4 percent

in 2007–08 to 3 percent in 2009–10. The percentages
of public schools that reported gang activity at all at
their schools during the school year decreased from
20 percent in 2007–08 to 16 percent in 2009–10
(table 7.2).
In 2009–10 the School Survey on Crime and Safety
included a questionnaire item on cyber-bullying
in which public schools were asked to report the
occurrence of cyber-bullying among students at
school and away from school.24 Eight percent of
public schools reported that cyber-bullying had
occurred among students daily or at least once a
week at school or away from school. Four percent
each of public schools also reported that the school
environment was affected by cyber-bullying and that
staff resources were used to deal with cyber-bullying
(table 7.3).
Public schools’ reports on the occurrence of cyberbullying at school and away from school in 2009–10
varied by school characteristics (table 7.3). Primary
schools reported lower percentages of cyber-bullying
among students (2 percent) than middle schools (19
percent), high schools (18 percent), and combined
schools (13 percent). Thirteen percent of schools with
less than 5 percent combined enrollment of Black,
Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/
Alaska Native students reported cyber-bullying
among students, compared with 5 percent of schools
with 50 percent or more combined enrollment.

Indicator 8
Students’ Reports of Gangs at School
In 2009, about 20 percent of students reported that gangs were present at their school. A higher percentage
of students from urban schools (31 percent) reported a gang presence than students from suburban (17
percent) and rural schools (16 percent).
The presence of gang activity in the vicinity of
schools poses a risk to staff and student safety and
school security. Intimidation of staff and students by
gang members has a large impact on the educational
environment and perception of school safety (Smith
2011). The School Crime Supplement to the National
Crime Victimization Survey asked students ages
12–18 if gangs were present at their school during
the school year.25
In 2009, about 20 percent of students ages 12–18
reported that gangs were present at their school
during the school year. This was a decrease from the
23 percent of students who reported a gang presence
in 2007. A higher percentage of students from urban
schools (31 percent) reported a gang presence at their
school in 2009 than students from suburban and
rural schools (17 percent and 16 percent, respectively).
While the percentage of students from suburban
schools who reported a gang presence at their school
was lower in 2009 than in 2007 (17 vs. 21 percent),
the percentages of students from urban and rural
schools who reported a gang presence were not
measurably different between the same years (figure
8.1 and table 8.1). In 2009, approximately 22 percent
of students attending public schools reported that
gangs were present at their school compared with
2 percent of students attending private schools.

approximately 21 percent of males and 20 percent of
females reported a gang presence during the school
year. The percentage of female students who reported
such was not measurably different between 2009 and
2007; however, the percentage of male students who
reported a gang presence was lower in 2009 than in
2007 (21 vs. 25 percent).
The percentages of students reporting a gang presence
at school varied by their race/ethnicity in 2009.
Higher percentages of Hispanic students (33 percent)
and Black students (31 percent) than White students
(14 percent) and Asian students (17 percent) reported
the presence of gangs.
Students’ reports of a gang presence at their school
also varied by grade in 2009 (figure 8.2 and table
8.1). The percentages of students in 6th through 8th
grade, for example, who reported a gang presence
at their school were lower than the percentages for
students in 9th through 12th grade. Eleven percent of
6th-graders reported the presence of gangs, compared
with 25 percent of 9th-graders and 28 percent of
10th-graders. The percentage of students in 10thgrade who reported a gang presence at their school
was higher than the percentages of students in 11th
grade (23 percent) and 12th grade (22 percent) who
reported a gang presence.

There were no measurable differences in the
percentages of male and female students who
reported a gang presence at their school in 2009—

Students’ Reports of Drug Availability on School Property
The percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them
decreased from 32 percent in 1995 to 23 percent in 2009.
In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades
9–12 were asked whether someone had offered, sold,
or given them an illegal drug on school property in
the 12 months before the survey.26 The percentage of
students in grades 9–12 who reported that drugs were
made available to them on school property increased
from 1993 to 1995 (from 24 to 32 percent), but
subsequently decreased to 23 percent in 2009 (table
9.1). There was no statistically significant difference,
however, between the 2009 percentage and the 2007
percentage (22 percent) (table 9.1 and figure 9.1).
Student reports of the availability of drugs on school
property varied by student characteristics. A higher
percentage of males than females reported that drugs
were offered, sold, or given to them on school property
in each survey year from 1993 to 2009 (figure 9.1
and table 9.1). For example, in 2009, 26 percent
of males reported that drugs were made available
to them, compared to 19 percent of females. There
were no measurable differences across grades in the
percentages of students reporting that drugs were
made available to them in 2009. Twenty-four percent
of 10th- and 11th-graders, 22 percent of 9th-graders
and 21 percent of 12th-graders reported that drugs
were made available to them.

The percentage of students who reported having
illegal drugs offered, sold, or given to them on school
property differed across racial/ethnic groups (figure
9.2 and table 9.1). Specifically, in 2009, higher
percentages of American Indian/Alaska Native
students (34 percent) and Hispanic students (31
percent) than Black students (22 percent), White
students (20 percent), and Asian students (18 percent)
reported that drugs were made available to them on
school property. In addition, a higher percentage of
students of two or more races (27 percent) than of
Asian students or White students reported that drugs
were made available to them on school property.
In 2009, student reports of the availability of drugs
on school property varied across the 42 states for
which data were available. Among these states, the
percentage of students reporting that drugs were
offered, sold, or given to them on school property
ranged from 15 percent in Kansas to 36 percent in
Hawaii and Nevada (table 9.2).

Students’ Reports of Being Called Hate-Related Words and Seeing
Hate-Related Graffiti
In 2009, about 9 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being targets of hate-related words at school
during the school year and 29 percent of students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school.
The School Crime Supplement to the National Crime
Victimization Survey collects data on students’
reports of being targets of hate-related27 words and
seeing hate-related graffiti at school.28 Specifically,
in 2009, students ages 12–18 were asked whether
someone at school had called them a derogatory
word having to do with their race, ethnicity, religion,
disability, gender, or sexual orientation. Students also
were asked if they had seen hate-related graffiti at
their school—that is, hate-related words or symbols
written in classrooms, bathrooms, hallways, or on the
outside of the school building.
In 2009, about 9 percent of students ages 12–18
reported being targets of hate-related words at
school and 29 percent of students reported seeing
hate-related graffiti at school during the school year
(figure 10.1 and table 10.1). While the percentage of
students who reported being targets of hate-related
words in 2009 was not measurably different from
the percentage who reported so in 2007 (10 percent),
the percentage of students who reported seeing haterelated graffiti at school was smaller in 2009 than in
2007 (35 percent). The percentage of students who
reported being targets of hate-related words decreased
from 12 percent in 2001 to 9 percent in 2009.

No measurable differences were observed in 2009 in
the percentages of males and females who reported
being called a hate-related word and seeing haterelated graffiti at school during the school year. The
percentages of male and female students ages 12–18
who reported being called a hate-related word during
the school year were not measurably different in 2007
(9 percent each) and 2009 (10 percent each). However,
the percentages of male and female students who
reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school were
lower in 2009 (29 percent each) than in 2007 (34
percent for male students and 35 percent for female
students).
Higher percentages of Black students and Hispanic
students (11 percent each) reported being targets of
hate-related words at school than White students (7
percent) in 2009. In addition, a higher percentage of
Hispanic students (32 percent) than White students
(28 percent) reported seeing hate-related graffiti.
Indicator 10 continued on page 42.

27

  “Hate-related” refers to derogatory terms used by others
in reference to students’ personal characteristics.
28
 “At school” includes the school building, on school
property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to
and from school.

Few differences were observed across grade levels
in the percentages of students who reported being
targets of hate-related words. A lower percentage of
12th-graders (6 percent) reported being targets of
hate-related words than 7th-graders and 10th-graders
(10 percent each), as well as 8th-graders (11 percent).
No measurable differences were observed across
grades for students’ reports of seeing hate-related
graffiti at school in 2009, nor were there differences
by grade in the percentages of students who reported
being called a hate-related word between 2007 and
2009. There were differences at some grade levels,
however, in the percentages of students who reported
seeing hate-related graffiti at school between 2007 and
2009. For example, about 35 percent of 6th-graders
reported seeing graffiti in 2007, compared with 28
percent in 2009.
By school sector, the percentage of public school
students who reported being called a hate-related
word (9 percent) was not measurably different from
the percentage reported by private school students
(7 percent) in 2009. In each data collection year
between 1999 and 2009, a higher percentage of public
school students than private school students reported
seeing hate-related graffiti at school. Specifically, for
2009, approximately 31 percent of public school

42

School Environment

students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school
compared with 12 percent of private school students.
Students who were targets of being called hate-related
words at school in 2009 were asked to indicate
whether the derogatory word they were called was
related to their race, ethnicity, religion, disability,
gender, or sexual orientation (figure 10.2 and table
10.2). A higher percentage of male students than
female students reported being called a hate-related
word with regard to their race (5 percent vs. 4
percent). In turn, a higher percentage of female
students than male students reported being called
a hate-related word with regard to their gender (3
percent vs. 1 percent).
With respect to being called a hate-related word
related to a student’s race or ethnicity, White students
reported being targets at a lower percentage than
their peers. For example, 2 percent of White students
reported being called a hate-related word with regard
to their race, compared with 8 percent each of Black
and Hispanic students. In addition, 1 percent of
White students reported being called a hate-related
word with regard to their ethnicity, compared with 4
percent of Black students and 7 percent of Hispanic
students.

In the School Crime Supplement (SCS) questionnaire, students were asked if they had been the target of hate-related words at school. Students
who indicated that they had been called a hate-related word were asked to choose the specific characteristics that the hate-related word targeted.
Students were allowed to choose more than one characteristic. If a student chose more than one characteristic, he or she is counted once under
the “total” category. Therefore, the total percentage of students who reported being called a hate-related word is less than the sum of the students’
individual characteristics.
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and going to and from school. “Hate-related” refers to
derogatory terms used by others in reference to students’ personal characteristics.

Indicator 11
Bullying at School and Cyber-Bullying Anywhere
In 2009, about 28 percent of 12- to 18-year-old students reported having been bullied at school during
the school year and 6 percent reported having been cyber-bullied.
Bullying is now recognized as a widespread and
often neglected problem in schools that has serious
implications for victims of bullying and for those
who perpetrate the bullying (Swearer et al. 2010).
The School Crime Supplement to the National Crime
Victimization Survey collects data on students ages
12–18 and their reports of being bullied at school29
and being cyber-bullied anywhere during the school
year. Cyber-bullying is distinct from bullying at
school. While data on cyber-bullying are collected
separately from data on bullying at school, the context
for cyber-bullying may have developed at school.
This indicator first discusses student reports
of being bullied at school in 2009 by selected
bullying problems, and selected student and school
characteristics. It then discusses student reports of
being cyber-bullied anywhere in 2009 by selected
cyber-bullying problems, and selected student and
school characteristics. In addition, findings on
bullying at school over time are presented for 2005,
2007, and 2009. Prior data are excluded from the
time series due to significant redesign of the bullying
items in 2005.
In 2009, about 28 percent of students ages 12–18
reported being bullied at school during the school year
(figure 11.1 and table 11.1).30 Of those students who
reported being bullied at school, 19 percent reported
that they had been made fun of, called names, or
insulted. Sixteen percent of students reported being
the subject of rumors, 9 percent said they had been
pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; and 6 percent
reported being threatened with harm. Five percent
of students reported being excluded from activities
on purpose, 4 percent reported that others had tried
to make them do things they did not want to do,
and 3 percent reported that their property had been
destroyed by others on purpose. In 2009, 22 percent
of students who had been pushed, shoved, tripped,

  “Bullying” includes being made fun of; being the subject

shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing things
they did not want to do; excluded from activities on purpose;
and having property destroyed on purpose.

or spit on at school during the school year, reported
being injured.
Students’ reports of being bullied at school varied by
student and school characteristics. In 2009, a higher
percentage of females (20 percent) than males (13
percent) ages 12–18 reported being the subject
of rumors, while a lower percentage of females (8
percent) than males (10 percent) reported being
pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on. In addition, a
higher percentage of females (6 percent) than males (4
percent) also reported being excluded from activities
on purpose.
The percentages of students who reported being
bullied or being subjects of selected bullying problems
were lower for Asian students than for White, Black,
or Hispanic students in 2009. For example, 17 percent
of Asian students ages 12–18 reported being bullied
at school during the school year, compared with
29 percent each of White and Black students and
26 percent of Hispanic students. Approximately 10
percent of Asian students reported being made fun of,
called names, or insulted, compared with 21 percent
of White students, 18 percent of Black students, and
16 percent of Hispanic students.
A higher percentage of 6th-graders than students in
grades 8 through 12 reported being bullied at school
during the school year. The percentages reported by
6th-graders and 7th-graders were not measurably
different. In 2009, about 39 percent of 6th-graders
reported being bullied at school, compared with 33
percent of 7th-graders, 32 percent of 8th-graders, 28
percent of 9th-graders, 27 percent of 10th-graders,
21 percent of 11th-graders, and 20 percent of 12thgraders. By school sector, a higher percentage of
public school students (29 percent) than private
school students (19 percent) reported being bullied
at school during the school year.

The School Crime Supplement asked students ages
12–18 who reported being bullied at school to indicate
the location in which they had been victimized. In
2009, about 48 percent of students reported being
bullied by another student in the hallway or stairwell
at school during the school year (figure 11.3 and table
11.2). In addition, 34 percent reported being bullied
inside the classroom, and 24 percent reported being
bullied outside on school grounds. Nine percent were
bullied in the bathroom or lockerroom, 7 percent were
bullied in the cafeteria, 6 percent of students reported
being bullied on the school bus, and 3 percent were
bullied somewhere else in school.
Of students who were bullied in 2009, a higher
percentage of females (52 percent) than males (44
percent) reported being bullied in the hallway
or stairwell, and a lower percentage of females

(21 percent) than males (27 percent) reported
being bullied outside on school grounds. A higher
percentage of public school students than private
school students (49 vs. 36 percent) reported being
bullied in the hallway or stairwell during the school
year, and a lower percentage of public school students
than private school students (23 vs. 37 percent)
reported being bullied outside on school grounds. In
addition, a higher percentage of students from rural
schools (56 percent) reported being bullied in the
hallway or stairwell than students from urban schools
(47 percent) and suburban schools (46 percent) and
a higher percentage of students from urban schools
(30 percent) than students from suburban schools
(23 percent) and rural schools (18 percent) reported
being bullied outside on school grounds.

In 2009, approximately 6 percent of students ages
12–18 reported being cyber-bullied 31 anywhere
during the school year (figure 11.2 and table 11.3).
Three percent reported being subject to harassing
text messages. Two percent of students reported that
another student had posted hurtful information on
the Internet and 2 percent reported that they had been
subject to harassing instant messaging. Students also
reported being the subject of harassing e-mails, being
excluded on-line, and being harassed while gaming
(1 percent each).
With the exception of being the subject of harassment
while gaming and being excluded on-line, females
reported being cyber-bullied at higher percentages
than males for each type of cyber-bullying problem.
For example, among students ages 12–18 in 2009,
about 4 percent of females reported being subject
to harassing text messages compared with 2 percent
of males.
Among those students who were bullied at school
or cyber-bullied anywhere, there generally were no
measurable differences between males and females in
the frequency in which they were bullied. Students
also were asked to report if they had notified an adult
about the perpetration (figure 11.4 and table 11.4).

school, a higher percentage of females (38 percent)
than males (23 percent) reported notifying an adult
after being cyber-bullied.
Students’ reports of being bullied at school varied over
time (figure 11.5 and table 11.5). While no overall
pattern was observed between 2005 and 2009, a lower
percentage of students reported being bullied in 2005
than in 2007 (28 vs. 32 percent). For most groups
of students, the percentages reported by students in
2007 were higher than the percentages reported in
2009, returning percentages to 2005 levels.
For the majority of student and school characteristics,
the percentages of students who reported being bullied
at school in 2005 were lower than the percentages
of students who did so in 2007. For example, 27
percent of male students and 29 percent of female
students reported being bullied at school in 2005,
compared with 30 percent of male students and 33
percent of female students who reported so in 2007.
The percentages of White students and Hispanic
students who reported being bullied during the school
year in 2005 were lower (30 percent and 22 percent,
respectively) than the corresponding percentages in
2007 (34 and 27 percent, respectively).
In 2007, the percent of public school students who
reported being bullied at school (32 percent) and the
percent of private school students who reported being
bullied at school (29 percent) was higher than in
2009, when 29 percent of public school students, and
19 percent of private school students reported being
bullied at school. In addition, a lower percentage
of students from suburban schools reported being
bullied in 2007 than in 2009. Between 2007 and
2009, no measurable differences were detected in the
percentages of students from urban or rural schools
who reported being bullied.

Indicator 12
Teachers’ Reports on School Conditions
In 2007–08, a greater percentage of public school teachers than private school teachers reported that student
misbehavior, student tardiness, and class cutting interfered with their teaching.
Classroom disruptions are associated with lower
student achievement for the offending student, as
well as for that student’s classmates (Lannie and
McCurdy 2007). In the Schools and Staffing Survey,
public and private school teachers were asked if
student misbehavior, student tardiness, and class
cutting interfered with their teaching. During the
2007–08 school year, 34 percent of teachers agreed
or strongly agreed that student misbehavior interfered
with their teaching, and 32 percent reported that
student tardiness and class cutting interfered with
their teaching (figure 12.1 and table 12.1). Teachers
were also asked whether school rules were enforced by
other teachers at their school, even for students not in
their classes, and whether they were enforced by the
principal. In 2007–08, 72 percent of teachers agreed
or strongly agreed that other teachers at their school
enforced the school rules, and 89 percent reported
that the principal enforced the school rules (figure
12.2 and table 12.2).
The percentage of teachers who reported that student
misbehavior, class cutting, and tardiness interfered
with their teaching varied by teacher and school
characteristics during 2007–08 (table 12.1). For
example, a greater percentage of public school teachers
than private school teachers reported that student
misbehavior (36 vs. 21 percent) and student tardiness
and class cutting (33 vs. 18 percent) interfered with
their teaching. And a higher percentage of secondary
school teachers than elementary school teachers
reported that student misbehavior (39 vs. 33 percent)
and student tardiness and class cutting (45 vs. 26
percent) interfered with their teaching.

A greater percentage of teachers in city schools
compared to teachers in suburban, town, or rural
schools reported that student misbehavior, tardiness,
and class cutting interfered with their teaching in
2007–08 (figure 12.1). Forty percent of teachers in
city schools, compared to 32 percent of teachers in
suburban schools, 34 percent of teachers in town
schools, and 31 percent of teachers in rural schools
reported that student misbehavior interfered with
their teaching. Thirty-eight percent of teachers in
city schools reported that student tardiness and class
cutting interfered with their teaching, compared to 29
percent of teachers in suburban schools, 32 percent of
teachers in town schools, and 27 percent of teachers
in rural schools who reported that these occurrences
interfered with their teaching.
The percentage of teachers who reported that student
misbehavior interfered with their teaching fluctuated
between 1987–88 and 1993–94; however, between
1993–94 and 2007–08 this percentage decreased
(from 41 to 34 percent). The percentage of teachers
reporting that student tardiness and class cutting
interfered with their teaching decreased between
1987–88 and 1993–94 (from 33 to 25 percent), but
increased between 1993–94 and 2007–08 (from 25
to 32 percent). There were no measurable differences
in the percentage of teachers reporting that student
misbehavior or tardiness and class cutting interfered
with their teaching between the two most recent
survey years, 2003–04 and 2007–08.

The percentage of teachers who agreed that school
rules were enforced by other teachers and by the
principal varied by teacher and school characteristics.
In every survey year, a higher percentage of elementary
school teachers than secondary school teachers agreed
that school rules were enforced by teachers and by the
principal in their school (table 12.2). In 2007–08,
79 percent of elementary teachers, compared to 56
percent of secondary teachers reported that school
rules were enforced by other teachers, and 89 percent
of elementary school teachers, compared to 86 percent
of secondary teachers, reported that school rules were
enforced by the principal.
Between 1987–88 and 2007–08, the percentage of
teachers who agreed that school rules were enforced

measurable differences in the percentage of teachers
reporting that school rules were enforced by other
teachers or by the principal between the two most

In 2007– 08, the percentage of public school
teachers who agreed or strongly agreed that student
misbehavior and student tardiness and class cutting
interfered with their teaching and that school rules
are enforced by other teachers and by the principal,
varied among the 50 states and the District of
Columbia. For example, among these states and the
District of Columbia, the percentage of teachers who
reported that student misbehavior interfered with
their teaching ranged from 59 percent of teachers in
the District of Columbia to 29 percent of teachers in
Pennsylvania (table 12.3).

Indicator 13
Physical Fights on School Property and Anywhere
The percentage of students in grades 9 through 12 who reported being in a physical fight anywhere decreased
between 1993 and 2009, from 42 to 31 percent; this was also true for the percentage of students who
reported being in a physical fight on school property, this percentage decreased from 16 to 11 percent.
Physical fights on school property are considered
a high-risk behavior that may disrupt a focused
learning environment at school; and students
involved in physical fights on school property may
face difficulties succeeding in their studies (Payne,
Gottfredson, and Gottfredson 2003). In the Youth
Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9–12 were
asked about their general involvement in physical
fights (referred to as “anywhere” in this indicator)
during the preceding 12 months, as well as about their
involvement in physical fights on school property.32
Fights occurring anywhere are included as a point of
comparison with fights occurring on school property.
Overall, the percentage of students who reported
being in a physical fight anywhere decreased from
42 percent in 1993 to 31 percent in 2009. Similarly,
the percentage of students who reported being in a
physical fight on school property decreased between
1993 and 2009, from 16 to 11 percent (figure 13.1
and table 13.1). Between the two most recent survey
years, 2007 and 2009, the percentage of students in
grades 9–12 who reported being in a fight anywhere
decreased from 36 to 31 percent. There was no
measurable difference between these two survey years
in the percentage of students who reported being in
a fight on school property.
Students were also asked how often they were in
physical fights anywhere during the past year. In
2009, 24 percent reported being in a fight one to three
times, 5 percent were in a fight four to eleven times,
and 3 percent were in a fight twelve or more times.
Ten percent of students reported being in a fight on
school property one to three times, 1 percent were in
a fight on school property four to eleven times, and
less than 1 percent were in a fight on school property
twelve or more times (table 13.2).

Generally, a higher percentage of students in 9th
grade reported being in fights than students in any
other grade, both anywhere and on school property.
For example, in 2009, 37 percent of 9th-graders,
compared to 33 percent of 10th-graders, 29 percent of
11th-graders, and 25 percent of 12th-graders reported
being in a fight anywhere. Similarly, 15 percent of
9th-graders, compared to 12 percent of 10th-graders,
10 percent of 11th-graders, and 7 percent of 12thgraders reported being in a fight on school property
in 2009. A smaller percentage of 12th-graders were
involved in physical fights anywhere and on school
property than any other grade.
The percentage of students who reported being in
a physical fight differed by race/ethnicity in 2009
(figure 13.2 and table 13.1). Generally, a smaller
percentage of Asian students reported being in
physical fights anywhere and on school property
than other racial/ethnic groups. In addition, smaller
percentages of White students reported being
in fights anywhere and on school property than
Black, Hispanic, or American Indian/Alaska Native
students. For example, 19 percent of Asian students
reported being in a physical fight anywhere at least
once during the previous 12 months, compared to 28
percent of White students, 36 percent of Hispanic
students, 41 percent of Black students, and 42 percent
of American Indian/Alaska Native students. Eight
percent of Asian students reported being in a fight
on school property at least once during the previous
12 months, compared to 14 percent of Hispanic
students, 17 percent of Black students, and 21 percent
of American Indian/Alaska Native students.
Indicator 13 continued on page 58.

From 1993 through 2009, the percentage of students
who reported being in a physical fight anywhere and
on school property decreased for all four grade levels
(grades 9 through12) (figure 13.1 and table 13.1).

For both males and females, the percentage of
students who reported being in a fight anywhere was
lower in 2009 than in 2007 (39 percent compared to
44 percent for males, and 23 percent compared to 27
percent for females). While the percentage of students
who reported being in fights on school property in
2009 was lower than in 2007 for females (7 percent
compared to 9 percent), there was no measurable
difference in the percentage who reported being
in fights on school property for males. A greater
percentage of males than females reported being in a
higher number of physical fights both anywhere and
on school property. For example, 4 percent of males
reported being in a fight twelve or more times in

58

Fights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances

2009, compared to 1 percent of females. One percent
of males reported being in a fight on school property
twelve or more times, compared to less than half a
percent of females (figure 13.3 and table 13.2).
Data for 2009 were available for 41 states. Among
these states, the percentage of students who reported
being in a fight anywhere ranged from 23 percent
in Maine to 37 percent in New Mexico, while the
percentage of students reporting being in a fight
on school property ranged from 7 percent in North
Dakota to 15 percent in Arkansas and New Mexico
(table 13.3).

Indicator 14
Students Carrying Weapons on School Property and Anywhere
Between 1993 and 2009, the percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported carrying a weapon at
least one day anywhere during the past 30 days declined from 22 to 17 percent, and the percentage carrying
a weapon on school property declined from 12 to 6 percent.
The presence of weapons at school may interfere with
teaching and learning by creating an intimidating
and threatening atmosphere (Aspy et al. 2004). In
the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students were asked
if they had carried a weapon such as a gun, knife, or
club in the past 30 days (referred to as ‘anywhere’
in this report) or if they had carried one of these
weapons on school property during the same time
period.33 Weapon carrying anywhere is included
as a point of comparison with weapon carrying on
school property. In 2009, 17 percent of students in
grades 9–12 reported that they had carried a weapon
anywhere on at least one day during the past 30 days:
8 percent carried a weapon anywhere on six or more
days of the period, 6 percent carried a weapon on
two to five days of the period, and 4 percent carried
a weapon on one day of the period (tables 14.1 and
14.2). As for the percentages of students who reported
carrying a weapon on school property during the
past 30 days, 6 percent of students reported that
they had carried a weapon on at least one day of the
period. This percentage was composed of 2 percent
of students reporting carrying a weapon on school
property on six or more days, 1 percent reporting
carrying a weapon on two to five days, and 2 percent
reporting carrying a weapon on one day.
The percentage of students who reported carrying
a weapon anywhere in the past 30 days declined
from 22 percent in 1993 to 17 percent in 2009.
In addition, from 1993 to 2009 the percentage of
students who reported carrying a weapon on school
property declined from 12 to 6 percent. However,
the percentage of students who reported carrying a
weapon either anywhere or on school property was
statistically unchanged from 2007 to 2009.
In every survey year, the percentage of males who
reported they had carried a weapon, either anywhere
or on school property was higher than the percentage
of females doing so (figure 14.1 and table 14.1). In
2009, for example, 27 percent of males carried a
weapon anywhere, compared to 7 percent of females,

and 8 percent of males carried a weapon on school
property, compared to 3 percent of females.
The percentage of students who reported carrying
a weapon anywhere or on school property varied
according to students’ race/ethnicity (figure 14.2
and table 14.1). In 2009, a smaller percentage of
Asian students (8 percent) than of students from any
other racial/ethnic group (the percentages for the
other groups ranged from 14 to 21 percent) reported
carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30
days. In addition, the percentage of White students
who reported carrying a weapon anywhere was higher
than that of Black students (19 vs. 14 percent). A
smaller percentage of Asian students (4 percent)
reported carrying a weapon on school property than
of Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students (10
percent), White students (6 percent), or Hispanic
students (6 percent).
In 2009, the percentages of 9th- through 12th-grade
students reporting carrying a weapon anywhere
during the past 30 days ranged from 16 to 18 percent,
whereas the percentages of 9th- through 12th-graders
reporting carrying a weapon on school property
during that time period ranged from 5 to 6 percent.
However, there were no significant differences in
the percentage of students who reported carrying a
weapon anywhere or on school property by grade level.
State level data were available in 37 states for students
who reported carrying a weapon anywhere and in 41
states for students who reported carrying a weapon
on school property. In 2009, the percentage of
students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere
and on school property (varied among the states for
which data were available (table 14.3). Among these
states, the percentage of students reporting carrying
a weapon anywhere ranged from 10 percent in
New Jersey and Rhode Island to 27 percent in New
Mexico, while the percentage of students reporting
carrying a weapon on school property ranged from 3
percent in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin
to 12 percent in Wyoming.

Indicator 15
Students’ Use of Alcohol on School Property and Anywhere
In 2009, about 42 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported having at least one drink of alcohol anywhere
in the past 30 days, while 4 percent had at least one drink on school property.
Alcohol consumption on school property is an illegal
behavior of students, that may lead to additional
crimes and misbehavior (Kodjo, Auinger, and
Ryan 2003). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey,
students in grades 9–12 were asked whether they had
consumed alcohol at all (referred to as “anywhere”
in this indicator) during the past 30 days and if
they had consumed alcohol on school property.34 In
most states, purchase and consumption of alcohol
anywhere publicly by students in grades 9–12 (as
they are under the legal drinking age of 21) is illegal.
Alcohol consumption anywhere is included as a
point of comparison with alcohol consumption on
school property. Overall, the percentage of students
reporting alcohol consumption anywhere in the past
30 days decreased from 48 percent in 1993 to 42
percent in 2009. The percentage of students reporting
alcohol consumption on school property in the past
30 days in 2009 was not measurably different from
the 1993 percentage (figure 15.1 and table 15.1).
In 2009, 20 percent of students in grades 9–12
reported using alcohol anywhere on one or two days
during the past 30 days. Twenty-one percent reported
using alcohol anywhere from three to twenty-nine
days during the past 30 days, and 1 percent reported
using alcohol anywhere all 30 days (table 15.2). In
addition, 3 percent of students reported using alcohol
on school property on one or two days during the
past 30 days, 1 percent of students reported using
alcohol on school property from three to twenty-nine
days during the past 30 days, and less than one-half
percent of students reported using alcohol on school
property all 30 days.
Since 2003, there has been no measurable difference
between the percentages of male and female students
who reported alcohol consumption anywhere (figure
15.1 and table 15.1). However, there were differences
in the reporting of how often alcohol was consumed

in 2009. For example, a higher percentage of females
than males reported consuming alcohol either one
or two days out of the previous 30 days in 2009 (23
percent vs. 18 percent). However, a higher percentage
of males than females reported consuming alcohol
from three to twenty-nine days (22 percent vs. 19
percent). One percent of male students reported
consuming alcohol anywhere all thirty days (figure
15.2 and table 15.2). In every survey year, a greater
percentage of males reported using alcohol on school
property than females (figure 15.1 and table 15.1).
For example, in 2009, 5 percent of males reported
consuming alcohol on school property at least one
time, whereas 4 percent of females did so. Two
percent of male students reported consuming alcohol
on school property from three to twenty-nine days
in 2009, whereas 1 percent of female students did so
(figure 15.2 and table 15.2).
In 2009, about one-half (52 percent) of 12th-graders
reported consuming alcohol anywhere at least one
time during the previous 30 days (figure 15.3 and
table 15.1). This percentage was higher than the
2009 percentage of 9th-graders (32 percent), 10thgraders (41 percent), and 11th-graders (46 percent)
who reported consuming alcohol anywhere at least
one time during the previous 30 days. There also
were differences in how often alcohol was consumed
anywhere among the grades in 2009 (table 15.2).
For example, a higher percentage of 12th-graders
(27 percent) than of 9th-graders (13 percent), 10thgraders (20 percent), and 11th-graders (23 percent)
reported consuming alcohol anywhere from three
to twenty-nine days in the past 30 days. In terms of
alcohol use on school property in 2009, there were
no measurable differences in alcohol consumption
among the grades.

Alcohol consumption anywhere and on school
property also varied by racial/ethnic group. In 2009,
a smaller percentage of Asian students (18 percent)
than of students of any other racial/ethnic group
reported consuming alcohol anywhere (figure 15.4
and table 15.1). In addition, a smaller percentage of
Black students (33 percent) than of White students
(45 percent) and Hispanic students (43 percent)
reported consuming alcohol anywhere at least one
time during the previous 30 days. Asian students
were less likely to consume alcohol on school
property (3 percent) than Pacific Islander/Native
Hawaiian students (10 percent), Hispanic students
and students of two or more races (7 percent), and
Black students (5 percent); however there was no
measurable difference in the alcohol consumption on
school property of Asian students and White students
(3 percent each).

State level data were available in 42 states for students
who reported drinking alcohol anywhere and in 38
states for students who reported drinking alcohol
on school property. The percentage of students who
reported drinking alcohol anywhere and on school
property varied among the states for which data
were available. Among these states, the percentage
of students who reported drinking alcohol anywhere
at least one day during the previous 30 days ranged
from 18 percent in Utah to 47 percent in Louisiana,
while the percentage of students who reported
drinking on school property ranged from 3 percent
in Alaska, Kansas, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, Tennessee, Utah, and Vermont to 8 percent

Indicator 16
Students’ Use of Marijuana on School Property and Anywhere
In 2009, 21 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported using marijuana anywhere at least one time in
the past 30 days, while 5 percent reported using marijuana at least one time on school property.
The Youth Risk Behavior Survey asked students in
grades 9–12 whether they had used marijuana at all
(referred to as “anywhere” in this indicator) in the past
30 days as well as whether they had used marijuana
on school property in the past 30 days.35 According
to students’ reports in 2009, students were four times
more likely to use marijuana anywhere than on school
property. Of students in grades 9–12, twenty-one
percent reported using marijuana at least one time
anywhere in the past 30 days, while 5 percent reported
using marijuana at least one time on school property
in the past 30 days (figure 16.1 and table 16.1).
The percentage of students who reported using
marijuana anywhere at least one time in the past 30
days was higher in 1999 (27 percent) than in 1993
(18 percent). Between 1999 and 2009, the percentage
of students who reported using marijuana anywhere
had declined to 21 percent. However, there was no
measurable difference between the percentage of
students who reported using marijuana anywhere
in 2005 and the percentage who reported using it
anywhere in 2009. With regard to marijuana use
on school property, the percentage of students who
reported using marijuana decreased between 1993
and 2009. In 1999, 7 percent of students reported
using marijuana at least one time during the past 30
days on school property, and by 2009 this percentage
had declined to 5 percent (figure 16.1 and table 16.1).
In every survey year, higher percentages of males
than females reported using marijuana anywhere
and on school property (figure 16.1 and table 16.1).
For example, in 2009, 23 percent of males reported
using marijuana anywhere during the previous 30
days, compared to 18 percent of females. According
to students’ reports, male students were twice as likely
as females to use marijuana on school property in
2009 (6 percent vs. 3 percent, respectively). There
were also differences between males and females in
the reported number of times using marijuana in
the past 30 days. Six percent of males reported using

marijuana 40 times or more anywhere in the past 30
days, compared to 2 percent of females. One percent
of males reported using marijuana 40 times or more
on school property, compared to less than one-half
percent of females (figure 16.2 and table 16.2).
Student reports on marijuana use anywhere and on
school property differed by racial/ethnic group in
2009. Generally, the percentage of Asian students
reporting using marijuana anywhere and on school
property during the previous 30 days was smaller
than that of most other racial/ethnic groups (figure
16.3 and table 16.1). For example, 7 percent of
Asian students reported using marijuana anywhere,
compared to 21 percent of White students; 22
percent each of Black students, Hispanic students,
and students of two or more races; 25 percent of
Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students; and 32
percent of American Indian/Alaska Native students.
Similarly, a smaller percentage of Asian students (2
percent) reported using marijuana on school property
than White students (4 percent), students of two or
more races (5 percent), Black students and Hispanic
students (6 percent each), and Pacific Islander/
Native Hawaiian students (9 percent). There was
no statistically significant difference between the
percentage of Asian students and the percentage of
American Indian/Alaska Native students reporting
using marijuana on school property.
The percentages of 9th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade
students, who reported using marijuana anywhere in
2009 were lower than the percentages of students in
those grades who used marijuana anywhere in 1999
(table 16.1). However, compared to a decade ago,
there was no significant change in the percentage of
11th-graders who reported using marijuana anywhere.
Lower percentages of students at each of grade levels
9 through 12 reported using marijuana on school
property in 2009 than in 1999.

Indicator 17
Students’ Perceptions of Personal Safety at School and Away From
School
In 2009, a higher percentage of students ages 12–18 reported that they were afraid of attack or harm at
school (4 percent) than away from school (3 percent) during the school year.
School violence can make students fearful and affect
their readiness and ability to learn, and concerns
about vulnerability to attacks can detract from a
positive school environment (Scheckner et al. 2002).
In the School Crime Supplement to the National
Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18
were asked how often36 they had been afraid of attack
or harm “at school or on the way to and from school”
as well as “away from school.”37 In 2009, a higher
percentage of students ages 12–18 reported that they
were afraid of attack or harm at school (4 percent)
than away from school (3 percent) during the school
year (figure 17.1 and table 17.1).
Student reports on their fears about their safety
varied by sex and race/ethnicity. Though there were
no measurable differences between the percentages
of male and female students who reported being
afraid of attack or harm at school in 2009, a greater
percentage of female (4 percent) than male students (3
percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm away
from school. A lower percentage of White students
(3 percent) than Black students (7 percent) reported
being afraid of attack or harm at school, and a lower
percentage of White students (2 percent) than both
Black students (6 percent) and Hispanic students (4
percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm away
from school.
Differences in students’ reports on their safety were
also detected by grade level in 2009. For example,
higher percentages of 6th-graders and 7th-graders
(6 percent each) reported being afraid of attack or

harm at school than 8th-graders (4 percent) and
11th-graders (3 percent). Away from school, a higher
percentage of 10th-graders (6 percent) reported being
afraid of attack or harm than students in the 9th,
11th, and 12th grades (2 to 3 percent).
School urbanicity was also related to students’ fear
of attack or harm. Both at school and away from
school, a higher percentage of students in urban
schools reported being afraid of attack or harm
than the corresponding percentages of students in
suburban and rural schools. Specifically, 7 percent
of students in urban schools reported being afraid of
attack or harm at school, compared with 4 percent
in rural schools and 3 percent in suburban schools.
Six percent of students in urban schools, compared
with 2 percent each of students in suburban and in
rural schools, reported being afraid of attack or harm
away from school.
Between 1995 and 2009, the percentage of students
who reported being afraid of attack or harm at
school decreased from 12 to 4 percent (figure 17.2).
A downward trend was also observed away from
school: between 1999 and 2009, the percentage of
students who feared attack or harm declined from
6 to 3 percent. Between the two most recent survey
years, 2007 and 2009, the percentage of students who
feared attack or harm at school was lower in 2009
(4 percent) than in 2007 (5 percent). However, no
measurable differences were found between 2007
and 2009 in the percentages of students who feared
attack or harm away from school.

36

 Students were asked if they “never,” “almost never,”
“sometimes,” or “most of the time” feared attack or harm
at school or away from school. Students responding
“sometimes” or “most of the time” were considered fearful.
37
 “At school” includes the school building, on school
property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to
and from school.

This indicator has been updated to include 2009 data. For more information: Table 17.1 and DeVoe and Bauer (2011), (http://nces.

Cognitive testing showed that estimates from 2007 and 2009 are comparable to previous years.
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. Fear of
attack away from school was not collected in 1995. For more information, please see appendix A.

Indicator 18
Students’ Reports of Avoiding School Activities or Specific Places
in School
In 2009, about 5 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they avoided school activities or one or
more places in school because they thought someone might attack or harm them.
School crime may lead students to perceive school
as unsafe, and in trying to ensure their own safety,
students may begin to skip school activities or avoid
certain places in school (Schreck and Miller 2003).
The percentage of students who avoid school activities
and certain areas in school is a measure of their
perception of school safety. In the School Crime
Supplement to the National Crime Victimization
Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked whether they
had avoided school activities or one or more places in
school because they were fearful that someone might
attack or harm them.38 In 2009, about 5 percent
of students reported that they had avoided at least
one school activity or one or more places in school
during the previous school year because they feared
being attacked or harmed. Specifically, 2 percent of
students reported that they had avoided at least one
school activity, and 4 percent reported that they had
avoided one or more places in school39 (figure 18.1
and table 18.1).
While there was no overall pattern of increase or
decrease between 1999 and 2009 in the percentage of
students who reported that they had avoided at least
one school activity or one or more places in school
because of fear of attack or harm, the percentage of
students who reported this avoidance was lower in
2009 (5 percent) than in 2007 (7 percent). In 2009,
38

 For the 2001 survey, the wording was changed from
“attack or harm” to “attack or threat of attack.” See appendix
A for more information.
39
 “Avoided school activities” includes avoiding any
(extracurricular) activities, skipping class, or staying home
from school. In 2007 and 2009, the survey wording was
changed from “any extracurricular activities” to “any
activities.” Please use caution when comparing changes in
this item over time. Avoiding one or more places in school
includes avoiding the entrance, any hallways or stairs, parts
of the cafeteria, restrooms, and other places inside the school
building.

about 1 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that
they had avoided any activities, 1 percent reported
that they had avoided any classes, and 1 percent
reported that they had stayed home from school.
By school building location, 2 percent of students
reported that they had avoided the stairs or hallways,
1 percent reported that they had avoided the entrance
to the school, 1 percent reported that they had avoided
parts of the school cafeteria, 1 percent reported that
they had avoided any school restrooms, and 1 percent
reported that they had avoided other places inside the
school building.
Students’ reports of avoiding one or more places in
school because of fear of attack or harm varied by
student characteristics (figure 18.2 and table 18.2).
In 2009, a higher percentage of Black students (6
percent) than White students (3 percent) reported
avoiding one or more places in school (table 18.2).
In addition, higher percentages of 6th-graders (7
percent), 7th-graders (5 percent), 8th-graders (5
percent), 9th-graders (4 percent), and 10th-graders
(4 percent) reported avoiding one or more places in
school than 12th-graders (2 percent) and 11th-graders
(1 percent). No measurable differences were detected
between the percentages of female and male students
who avoided one or more places in school in 2009
(4 percent each).
In 2009, school locale also was related to students’
reports of avoidance of places in school out of fear of
attack or harm. A higher percentage of students in
urban schools (6 percent) than in suburban schools (3
percent) reported avoiding one of more places during
the school year.

Indicator 19
Serious Disciplinary Actions Taken by Public Schools
During the 2009–10 school year, 39 percent of public schools took at least one serious disciplinary action
against a student for specific offenses. A total of 433,800 serious disciplinary actions were taken by public
schools during this period.
In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public
school principals were asked to report the number
of disciplinary actions their schools had taken
against students for specific offenses. The student
offenses were physical attacks or fights; distribution,
possession, or use of alcohol; distribution, possession,
or use of illegal drugs; use or possession of a firearm
or explosive device; and use or possession of a weapon
other than a firearm or explosive device.
During the 2009–10 school year, 39 percent of public
schools (32,300 schools) took at least one serious
disciplinary action—including suspensions lasting
5 days or more, removals with no services for the
remainder of the school year (i.e., expulsions), and
transfers to specialized schools—for specific offenses
(table 19.1).
Out of all offenses reported, physical attacks or
fights prompted the largest percentage of schools
(29 percent) to respond with at least one serious
disciplinary action (figure 19.1 and table 19.1). In
response to other offenses by students, 20 percent of
schools reported that they took disciplinary action for
the distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs;
13 percent took action for the use or possession of
a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device;
9 percent did so for the distribution, possession, or
use of alcohol; and 3 percent did so for the use or
possession of a firearm or explosive device.

During the 2009–10 school year, the percentage of
public schools that took serious disciplinary actions
increased with school level. A higher percentage of
high schools (83 percent) took at least one serious
disciplinary action than did middle schools (67
percent) and primary schools (18 percent). Combined
schools took at least one serious disciplinary action
at a higher percentage (49 percent) than primary
schools, but at a lower percentage than either middle
schools or high schools. This pattern by school level
was generally observed for disciplinary actions taken
in response to specific offenses as well. For example,
66 percent of high schools took serious disciplinary
actions in response to distribution, possession, or
use of illegal drugs, compared with 37 percent of
middle schools, 23 percent of combined schools, and
2 percent of primary schools.
A total of 433,800 serious disciplinary actions were
taken by public schools during the 2009–10 school
year. Most of these reported disciplinary actions
were taken in response to physical attacks or fights
(265,100 actions). The number of disciplinary actions
taken in response to the use or possession of a firearm
or explosive device (5,800 actions) was smaller than
for other offenses reported. Of the serious disciplinary
actions taken during the 2009–10 school year, 74
percent were suspensions for 5 days or more, 20
percent were transfers to specialized schools, and
6 percent were removals with no services for the
remainder of the school year.

in response to physical attacks or fights (81 percent)
and the distribution, possession, or use of alcohol
(74 percent) than were imposed in response to the
other offenses covered in the survey (ranging from
55 to 62 percent) (figure 19.2). Greater percentages
of removals with no services for the remainder of
the school year were imposed upon students in
response to the use or possession of a firearm or

explosive device (22 percent) than were imposed in
response to other offenses reported (ranging from
4 to 9 percent). Greater percentages of transfers
to specialized schools were imposed in response

Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures

The percentage of schools taking at least one serious
disciplinary action declined between 1999–2000
and 2009–10 from 54 to 39 percent (figure 19.3,
table 19.2, and table 19.3). This same pattern of
decline held true for the percentage of schools
taking at least one serious disciplinary action for
physical attacks or fights between 1999–2000

(35 percent) and 2009–10 (29 percent). No linear
trends were detected in the percentages of schools
that took at least one serious disciplinary action for
other offenses over time between 1999–2000 and
2009–10, nor were measurable differences detected
in the percentages between the two most recent
survey years.

Safety and Security Measures Taken by Public Schools
During the 2009–10 school year, 93 percent of public schools reported that they had limited the access to
social networking websites from school computers, and 91 percent reported that they had prohibited the
use of cell phones and text messaging devices during school hours.
Public schools use a variety of practices and
procedures to promote the safety of students and staff.
In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public
school principals were asked about their schools’
use of safety and security measures and procedures.
Certain practices, such as locked or monitored doors
or gates, are intended to limit or control access
to school campuses, while others, such as metal
detectors, security cameras, and limiting access to
social networking websites, are intended to monitor
or restrict students’ and visitors’ behavior on campus.
In the 2009–10 school year, nearly all public schools
reported that they required visitors to sign in or check
in (99 percent) (table 20.1). Other frequently reported
safety and security measures included limiting access
to social networking websites from school computers
(93 percent), controlling access to school buildings
by locking or monitoring doors during school hours
(92 percent), and prohibiting the use of cell phones
and text messaging devices during school hours (91
percent) (figure 20.1). In addition, 63 percent of
public schools reported that they had an electronic
notification system for a schoolwide emergency,
and 36 percent reported that they had a structured,
anonymous threat reporting system in place.
The use of safety and security measures varied by
school level during the 2009–10 school year. In
general, higher percentages of high schools than
middle or primary schools and higher percentages
of middle schools than primary schools reported
using the following safety and security measures:
drug testing for athletes; drug testing for students in
extracurricular activities;40 requiring students to wear
badges or picture IDs; random dog sniffs to check for
drugs;40 random sweeps for contraband;41,42 and using
security cameras to monitor the school40 (table 20.2).
For example, 84 percent of high schools, 73 percent
of middle schools, and 51 percent of primary schools
reported that they used security cameras to monitor
their schools. In addition, the percentages of middle
40

schools (71 percent) and high schools (67 percent)
that reported having an electronic notification system
for a schoolwide emergency were higher than the
percentage of primary schools with such a system
(61 percent), and the percentages of middle schools
(48 percent) and high schools (46 percent) having a
structured, anonymous threat reporting system in
place were higher than the percentage of primary
schools (30 percent) having such a system in place.
However, a lower percentage of high schools (86
percent) than middle schools and primary schools
(94 percent each) reported controlling access to
buildings during school hours, and the percentage of
high schools (80 percent) that reported prohibiting
the use of cell phones and text messaging devices was
lower than the corresponding percentages of primary
schools (93 percent) and middle schools (97 percent).
The percentage of higher schools (10 percent) that
reported requiring students to wear uniforms was
lower than the percentages of middle schools (19
percent) and primary schools (22 percent) with such
a requirement.
In the 2009–10 school year, the use of safety and
security measures also differed by school enrollment
size. Higher percentages of public schools with 1,000
or more students than schools with fewer students
reported the use of the following safety and security
measures: controlling access to grounds during school
hours; drug testing for athletes; requiring students
to wear badges or picture IDs; metal detector checks
on students (including both random checks and
requiring students to pass through checks daily);
random dog sniffs to check for drugs; having a
structured, anonymous threat reporting system in
place; and using security cameras to monitor the
school. For example, 56 percent of schools with an
enrollment size of 1,000 or more students reported
having a structured, anonymous threat reporting
system, compared with 38 percent of schools with an
enrollment size of 500–999 students, 32 percent of
schools with an enrollment size of 300–499 students,
and 28 percent of schools with an enrollment size of
less than 300 students.

Locale and the school’s percentage of students who
are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch were also
associated with the use of safety and security measures
in the 2009–10 school year. Higher percentages of
city schools than schools in suburban, town, and
rural areas reported controlling access to school
grounds during school hours, conducting random
metal detector checks, and requiring students to
wear uniforms. For example, 35 percent of city
schools reported requiring students to wear uniforms,
compared with 19 percent of suburban schools,
10 percent of schools in towns, and 9 percent of
rural schools reporting such a requirement. Higher
percentages of high-poverty schools (where 76 percent
or more students are eligible for free or reduced-price
lunch) than low-poverty schools (where 25 percent or
less of students are eligible for free or reduced-price
lunch) reported controlling access to school grounds
during school hours, requiring students to wear
badges or picture IDs, conducting random metal
detector checks on students, and requiring students
to wear uniforms. For instance, 11 percent of highpoverty schools reported conducting random metal
detector checks on students, compared with 1 percent
of low-poverty schools reporting such checks.

Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures

The percentage of schools using various security
measures has changed over time. Between the 1999–
2000 and 2009–10 school years, the percentages of
public schools reporting the use of the following safety
and security measures increased: controlling access to
buildings during school hours (from 75 to 92 percent);
controlling access to school grounds during school
hours (from 34 to 46 percent); requiring faculty to
wear badges or picture IDs (from 25 to 63 percent);
using one or more security cameras to monitor the
school (from 19 to 61 percent); providing telephones
in most classrooms (from 45 to 74 percent); and
requiring that students wear uniforms (from 12 to
19 percent) (figure 20.2 and table 20.1). In addition,
between the 2007–08 and 2009–10 school years,
there was an increase in the percentage of schools
reporting the use of an electronic notification system
for a schoolwide emergency (from 43 to 63 percent)
as well as an increase in the percentage of schools
that reported having a structured, anonymous threat
reporting system (from 31 to 36 percent).

Indicator 21
Students’ Reports of Safety and Security Measures Observed at School
Sixty-four percent of students ages 12–18 reported observing locked entrance or exit doors during the day
at their schools in 2009, compared with 61 percent of students in 2007.
Schools use a variety of measures to promote the
safety of students, ranging from codes of student
conduct to metal detectors. In the School Crime
Supplement to the National Crime Victimization
Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked whether their
schools used certain security measures.43 Security
measures include metal detectors, locker checks,
security cameras, security guards or police officers,
adult supervision in hallways, badges or picture
identification for students, a code of student conduct,
locked entrance or exit doors during the day, and a
requirement that visitors sign in. In 2009, nearly all
students (99 percent) ages 12–18 reported that they
observed the use of at least one of the selected security
measures at their schools (figure 21.1 and table 21.1).
The majority of students ages 12–18 reported
in 2009 that their schools had a code of student
conduct (96 percent) and a requirement that visitors
sign in (94 percent). Approximately 68 percent of
students reported the presence of security guards
and/or assigned police officers, and 91 percent
reported the presence of other school staff or other
adult supervision in the hallway. Some 70 percent
of students reported the use of security cameras at
their schools, 64 percent reported locked entrance or
exit doors during the day, and 54 percent reported
locker checks. In addition, 23 percent of students
reported that badges or picture identifications were
required at their schools. Metal detectors were the
least observed of the selected safety and security
measures: 11 percent of students reported the use of
metal detectors at their schools.

The percentages of students who reported the presence
of some of the selected security measures at school
has increased over time as well as between the two
most recent survey years. Specifically, the percentage
of students who reported observing the use of one
or more security cameras at their schools was 70
percent in 2009, which represented an increase from
39 percent in 2001 as well as an increase from 66
percent in 2007. Similarly, the percentage of students
who reported observing locked entrance or exit
doors during the day was 64 percent in 2009, which
represented an increase from 38 percent in 1999 as
well as an increase from 61 percent in 2007. Higher
percentages of students in 2009 than in 1999 reported
the presence of security guards and/or assigned police
officers (68 vs. 54 percent) and the presence of other
school staff or other adult supervision in the hallway
(91 vs. 85 percent).
Between 1999 and 2009, the percentage of students
who reported a visitor sign-in requirement increased
from 87 to 94 percent, although no measurable
differences in the percentage were detected between
the two most recent survey years, 2007 and 2009 (94
percent each). Across all survey years, no measurable
differences were detected in the percentages of
students who reported locker checks, requirements
that students wear badges or picture identification,
or a code of student conduct in their schools during
the school year.

  Readers should note that this indicator relies on student
reports of security measures and provides estimates based
on students’ awareness of the measure rather than on
documented practice. See Indicator 20 for a summary of the
use of various security measures as reported by schools.

This indicator has been updated to include 2009–10 data. For more information: Table 21.1 and DeVoe and Bauer (2011), (http://

A school-associated violent death is defined as “a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal
injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States” while the victim was on the way to or from
regular sessions at school or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims include students, staff
members, and others who are not students, from July 1, 1992, through June 30, 2010.

The data from 1999–2000 onward are subject to change until interviews with school and law enforcement officials have been completed. The details
learned during the interviews can occasionally change the classification of a case. For more information on this survey, please see appendix A.
NOTE: A school-associated violent death is defined as “a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), in which the
fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States” while the victim was on the way to or from
regular sessions at school or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims include students, staff
members, and others who are not students. Estimates were revised and may differ from previously published data.
SOURCE: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1992–2010 School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study (SAVD), partially
funded by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools, previously unpublished tabulation (July 2011).

Serious violent victimization is also included in violent victimization.
Due to methodological changes, use caution when comparing 2006 estimates to other years.
NOTE: “Serious violent victimization” includes rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. “Violent victimization” includes serious violent
crimes and simple assault. “Theft” includes purse-snatching, pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, with the exception of motor
vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which threat or use of force is involved. Robbery is classified as a violent crime. “Total victimization”
includes violent crimes and theft. “At school” includes inside the school building, on school property, or on the way to or from school. Although
Indicators 2 and 3 present information on similar topics, the survey sources for these two indicators differ with respect to time coverage and
administration. For more information on these two surveys, please see appendix A. Detail may not sum to total due to rounding. Estimates may vary
from previously published reports Estimates of the number of crimes are rounded to the nearest 100.

crimes and simple assault. “Theft” includes purse-snatching, pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, with the exception of motor
vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which threat or use of force is involved. Robbery is classified as a violent crime. “Total victimization”
includes violent crimes and theft. “At school” includes inside the school building, on school property, or on the way to or from school. Although
Indicators 2 and 3 present information on similar topics, the survey sources for these two indicators differ with respect to time coverage and
administration. For more information on these two surveys, please see appendix A. Population size is 25,546,000 students ages 12–18 in 2010. Detail
may not sum to total due to rounding and missing data on student characteristics. Estimates of number of crimes are rounded to the nearest 100.

2
Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. “Other” includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian (prior to 2005), Pacific Islander,
and, from 2003 onward, two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made
with caution.
3
Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
NOTE: “Theft” includes attempted and completed purse-snatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, excluding
motor vehicle theft. Theft does not include robbery, in which the threat or use of force is involved. “Serious violent victimization” includes rape,
sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. “Violent victimization” include serious violent crimes and simple assault. “Total victimization”
includes violent crimes and theft. “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and
from school. Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on similar topics, the survey sources for these two indicators differ with respect to time
coverage and administration. For more information on these two surveys, please see appendix A. Detail may not sum to totals due to rounding and
student reports of “theft”, “violent” and “serious violent” victimization may not sum to “total” victimization because respondents could report more
than one type of victimization.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.

The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995,
and 1997, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing two or
more races.

“Theft or larceny” (taking things worth over $10 without personal confrontation) was defined for respondents as “the unlawful taking of another
person’s property without personal confrontation, threat, violence, or bodily harm.” This includes pocket picking, stealing a purse or backpack (if left
unattended or no force was used to take it from owner), theft from a building, theft from a motor vehicle or motor vehicle parts or accessories, theft
of a bicycle, theft from a vending machine, and all other types of thefts.
2
For SSOCS:2000, SSOCS:2004, SSOCS:2006, and SSOCS:2008, other incidents include possession of a firearm or explosive device; possession
of a knife or sharp object; distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol; and vandalism. Beginning in 2009-10 the definition of other
incidents was changed to include the inappropriate distribution, possession, or use of prescription drugs in addition to the aformentioned items.
Caution should be used when making direct comparisons between years.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At school” was
defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold schoolsponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school hours or when
school activities or events were in session. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Estimates of number of incidents are rounded to the
nearest 100.

“Theft or larceny” (taking things worth over $10 without personal confrontation) was defined for respondents as “the unlawful taking of another
person’s property without personal confrontation, threat, violence, or bodily harm.” This includes pocket picking, stealing a purse or backpack (if left
unattended or no force was used to take it from owner), theft from a building, theft from a motor vehicle or motor vehicle parts or accessories, theft
of a bicycle, theft from a vending machine, and all other types of thefts.
4
“Other incidents” include possession of a firearm or explosive device; possession of a knife or sharp object; distribution, possession, or use of
illegal drugs or alcohol; vandalism; and inappropriate distribution, possession, or use of prescription drugs.
5
Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 8.
Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. High
schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 12. Combined
schools include all other combinations of grades, including K–12 schools.

Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of full-time-equivalent
(FTE) teachers. Information regarding the total number of FTE teachers was obtained from the Common Core of Data (CCD), the sampling frame
for SSOCS.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At school” was
defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold schoolsponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school hours or when
school activities or events were in session. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Estimates of number of incidents and schools are
rounded to the nearest 100.

Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 8.
Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. High
schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 12. Combined
schools include all other combinations of grades, including K–12 schools.

Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of full-time-equivalent
(FTE) teachers. Information regarding the total number of FTE teachers was obtained from the Common Core of Data (CCD), the sampling frame
for SSOCS.
NOTE: “Serious violent incidents” include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon, threat of physical attack with
a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon. Serious violent incidents are also included in violent incidents. Responses were provided by the
principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. “At school” was defined for respondents to include activities
that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents
were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session.
Detail may not sum to totals due to rounding.

“Violent incidents” include rape, or attempted rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, threat of
physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon.
NOTE: “Cyber-bullying” was defined for respondents as “occurring when willful and repeated harm is inflicted through the use of computers, cell
phones, or other electronic devices.” Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at
the school. “At school” was defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at
places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to respond only for those times that were during normal school
hours or when school activities or events were in session.

In 2007 and 2009, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period was the previous 6 months.
Cognitive testing showed that estimates from 2007 and 2009 are comparable to previous years.
2
Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian (prior to 2005), Pacific Islander, and,
from 2003 onward, two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with
caution.
NOTE: Urbanicity refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S.
Census Bureau. Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).” All gangs,
whether or not they are involved in violent or illegal activity, are included. “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school
bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.
2
The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999, making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993,
1995, and 1997, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing
two or more races.

Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian (prior to 2005), Pacific Islander,
and, from 2003 onward, two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made
with caution.

NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. “Haterelated” refers to derogatory terms used by others in reference to students’ personal characteristics. Detail may not sum to totals due to rounding.

In the School Crime Supplement (SCS) questionnaire, students were asked if they had been the target of hate-related words at school. Students
who indicated that they had been called a hate-related word were asked to choose the specific characteristics that the hate-related word targeted.
Students were allowed to choose more than one characteristic. If a student chose more than one characteristic, he or she is counted once under
the “total” category. Therefore, the total percentage of students who reported being called a hate-related word is less than the sum of the students’
individual characteristics.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.
2
The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999, making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993,
1995, and 1997, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing
two or more races.
3
Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” was not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students were
simply asked how many times in the last 12 months they have been in a physical fight.

NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” was not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students were
simply asked how many times in the last 12 months they had been in a physical fight. National, state, territory, and local YRBS data come from
separate scientific samples of schools and students. With the exception of Ohio and South Dakota, state representative samples are drawn from
public schools only for the state level data. U.S. total, Ohio and South Dakota include public and private schools.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.
2
The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995,
and 1997, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing two or
more races.
3
Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” was not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students were
simply asked on how many days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days.

NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” was not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students were
simply asked how many days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days. National, state, territory, and local YRBS data come from separate
scientific samples of schools and students. With the exception of Ohio and South Dakota, state representative samples are drawn from public
schools only for the state level data. U.S. total, Ohio and South Dakota include public and private schools.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.
2
The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999 making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993, 1995,
and 1997, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing two or
more races.
3
Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” was not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students were
simply asked how many days did they have at least one drink of alcohol during the past 30 days.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity.
2
The response categories for race/ethnicity changed in 1999, making comparisons of some categories with earlier years problematic. In 1993,
1995, and 1997, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing
two or more races.
3
Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
NOTE: “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents. The term “anywhere” was not used in the YRBS questionnaire; students were
simply asked how many times during the past 30 days they used marijuana.

In 2007 and 2009, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period was the previous 6 months.
Cognitive testing showed that estimates from 2007 and 2009 are comparable to previous years.

Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Other includes American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian (prior to 2005), Pacific Islander, and,
from 2003 onward, two or more races. Due to changes in racial/ethnic categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with
caution.

Refers to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status of the respondent’s household as defined in 2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Categories include “central city of an MSA (Urban),” “in MSA but not in central city (Suburban),” and “not MSA (Rural).”
NOTE: “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. For the
2001 survey, the wording was changed from “attack or harm” to “attack or threat of attack.” Students were asked if they “never,” “almost never,”
“sometimes,” or “most of the time” feared attack or harm at school or away from school. Students responding “sometimes” or “most of the time” were
considered fearful. Fear of attack away from school was not collected in 1995.

Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 8.
Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. High
schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 12. Combined
schools include all other combinations of grades, including K–12 schools.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. Serious
disciplinary actions include removals with no continuing services for at least the remainder of the school year, transfers to specialized schools for
disciplinary reasons, and out-of-school suspensions lasting 5 or more days, but less than the remainder of the school year. Respondents were
instructed to respond only for those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the
survey specified otherwise. Detail may not sum to total because schools could report more than one type of offense, but were only counted once in
the total.

The questionnaire wording prior to 2005–06 was “use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm”.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. Serious
disciplinary actions include removals with no continuing services for at least the remainder of the school year, transfers to specialized schools
for disciplinary reasons, and out-of-school suspensions lasting 5 or more days, but less than the remainder of the school year. Respondents
were instructed to respond only for those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless
the survey specified otherwise. The total for 2009–10 is not available as the SSOCS questionnaire was redesigned in 2009–10 and excluded
insubordination. The totals prior to 2009–10 include insubordination. Detail may not sum to total because schools could report more than one type of
offense, but were only counted once in the total. Estimates of number of actions are rounded to the nearest 100.

Student/teacher ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of students enrolled in the school by the total number of full-time-equivalent
(FTE) teachers. Information regarding the total number of FTE teachers was obtained from the Common Core of Data (CCD), the sampling frame
for SSOCS.
NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. Respondents
were instructed to respond only for those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the
survey specified otherwise.

General Information
The indicators in this report are based on information
drawn from a variety of independent data sources,
including national surveys of students, teachers,
and principals, and data collections from federal
departments and agencies, including the Bureau of
Justice Statistics, the National Center for Education
Statistics, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Each data source has an independent sample design,
data collection method, and questionnaire design or
is the result of a universe data collection. Universe
data collections include a census of all known entities
in a specific universe (e.g., all deaths occurring on
school property). Readers should be cautious when
comparing data from different sources. Differences in
sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and
question phrasing can all affect the comparability of
results. For example, some questions from different
surveys may appear the same, but were asked of
different populations of students (e.g., students ages
12–18 or students in grades 9–12); in different years;
about experiences that occurred within different
periods of time (e.g., in the past 30 days or during
the past 12 months); or at different locations (e.g., in
school or anywhere).
All comparisons described in this report are
statistically significant at the .05 level. The primary
test procedure used in this report was Student’s t
statistic, which tests the difference between two
sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted
for multiple comparisons. Estimates displayed in the
text, figures, and tables are rounded from original
estimates, not from a series of rounding.
The following is a description of data sources,
accuracy of estimates, and statistical procedures used
in this report.

Sources of Data
This section briefly describes each of the datasets used
in this report: the School-Associated Violent Deaths
Surveillance Study, the Supplementary Homicide
Reports, the Web-based Injury Statistics Query
and Reporting System Fatal, the National Crime
Victimization Survey, the School Crime Supplement
to the National Crime Victimization Survey, the
Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the Schools and Staffing
Survey, and the School Survey on Crime and Safety.
Directions for obtaining more information are
provided at the end of each description.

School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study
(SAVD)
The School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance
Study (SAVD) is an epidemiological study developed
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
conjunction with the U.S. Department of Education
and the U.S. Department of Justice. SAVD seeks to
describe the epidemiology of school-associated violent
deaths, identify common features of these deaths,
estimate the rate of school-associated violent death in
the United States, and identify potential risk factors
for these deaths. The surveillance system includes
descriptive data on all school-associated violent
deaths in the United States, including all homicides,
suicides, or legal intervention in which the fatal injury
occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary
or secondary school; while the victim was on the way
to or from regular sessions at such a school; or while
attending or on the way to or from an official schoolsponsored event. Victims of such incidents include
nonstudents, as well as students and staff members.
SAVD includes descriptive information about the
school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). The SAVD
Surveillance System has collected data from July 1,
1992, through the present.
SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and
collect data on school-associated violent deaths.
Cases are initially identified through a search of
the LexisNexis newspaper and media database.
Then law enforcement officials are contacted to
confirm the details of the case and to determine if
the event meets the case definition. Once a case is
confirmed, a law enforcement official and a school
official are interviewed regarding details about the
school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). A copy of
the full law enforcement report is also sought for each
case. The information obtained on schools includes
school demographics, attendance/absentee rates,
suspensions/expulsions and mobility, school history
of weapon-carrying incidents, security measures,
violence prevention activities, school response to the
event, and school policies about weapon carrying.
Event information includes the location of injury,
the context of injury (while classes were being held,
during break, etc.), motives for injury, method of
injury, and school and community events happening
around the time period. Information obtained on
victim(s) and offender(s) includes demographics,
circumstances of the event (date/time, alcohol or drug
use, number of persons involved), types and origins of
weapons, criminal history, psychological risk factors,
school-related problems, extracurricular activities,
and family history, including structure and stressors.

One hundred and five school-associated violent deaths
were identified from July 1, 1992, to June 30, 1994
(Kachur et al. 1996). A more recent report from
this data collection identified 253 school-associated
violent deaths between July 1, 1994, and June 30,
1999 (Anderson et al. 2001). Other publications from
this study have described how the number of events
change during the school year (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention 2001), the source of the
firearms used in these events (Reza et al. 2003), and
suicides that were associated with schools (Kauffman
et al. 2004). The most recent publication describes
trends in school associated homicide from July 1,
1992, to June 30, 2006 (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention 2008). The interviews conducted
on cases between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1999,
achieved a response rate of 97 percent for police
officials and 78 percent for school officials. For several
reasons, all data for years from 1999 to the present
are flagged as preliminary . For some recent data, the
interviews with school and law enforcement officials
to verify case details have not been completed. The
details learned during the interviews can occasionally
change the classification of a case. Also, new cases
may be identified because of the expansion of the
scope of the media files used for case identification.
Sometimes other cases not identified during earlier
data years using the independent case finding efforts
(which focus on nonmedia sources of information)
will be discovered. Also, other cases may occasionally
be identified while the law enforcement and school
interviews are being conducted to verify known cases.

Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR)
The Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR),
which are a part of the Uniform Crime Reporting
(UCR) program, provide incident-level information
on criminal homicides, including situation (number
of victims to number of offenders); the age, sex,
and race of victims and known offenders; types of
weapons used; circumstances of the incident; and
the relationship of the victim to the offender. The
data are provided monthly to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) by local law enforcement agencies

participating in the FBI’s UCR program. The data
include murders and nonnegligent manslaughters in
the United States from January 1980 to December
2009; that is, negligent manslaughters and justifiable
homicides have been eliminated from the data. Based
on law enforcement agency reports, the FBI estimates
that 581,709 murders (including non-negligent
manslaughters) were committed from 1980 to 2009.
Agencies provided detailed information on 522,564
of these homicide victims.
About 90 percent of homicides are included in
the SHR. However, adjustments can be made to
the weights to correct for missing victim reports.
Estimates from the SHR used in this report were
generated by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)
using a weight developed by BJS that reconciles the
counts of SHR homicide victims with those in the
UCR for the 1992 through 2009 data years. The
weight is the same for all cases for a given year. The
weight represents the ratio of the number of homicides
reported in the UCR to the number reported in
the SHR. For additional information about SHR,

Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting
System Fatal (WISQARS™ Fatal)
WISQARS Fatal provides mortality data related to
injury. The mortality data reported in WISQARS
Fatal come from death certificate data reported to
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data
include causes of death reported by attending
physicians, medical examiners, and coroners. It also
includes demographic information about decedents
reported by funeral directors, who obtain that information from family members and other informants.
NCHS collects, compiles, verifies, and prepares these
data for release to the public. The data provide information about what types of injuries are leading causes
of deaths, how common they are, and who they affect.
These data are intended for a broad audience—the
public, the media, public health practitioners and
researchers, and public health officials—to increase
their knowledge of injury.

National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS),
administered for the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics
by the U.S. Census Bureau, is the nation’s primary
source of information on crime and the victims of
crime. Initiated in 1972 and redesigned in 1992, the
NCVS collects detailed information on the frequency
and nature of the crimes of rape, sexual assault,
robbery, aggravated and simple assault, theft, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft experienced
by Americans and their households each year. The
survey measures both crimes reported to police and
crimes not reported to the police.
In past reports, the NCVS estimates were reported
using the data-year format. Under the data-year
format, crime incidents are reported based on the year
that the incident actually occurred. Thus, given that
the NCVS employs a six month retrospective reference period, 18 months of interviews are necessary
to estimate a year of crime incidents. For example, a
respondent interviewed in June, 2010 may indicate
that a crime occurred in December, 2009. Under
the data-year format that crime would be counted
in 2009. Under the alternative collection-year
format, crime incidents are reported based on when
the interview was conducted, not when the crime
occurred. In the previous example the crime would
be counted in 2010. Whereas the data-year format
requires 18 months of interviews to estimate crime
incidents, the collection-year format requires only 12
months. Therefore, estimates of crime can be reported
in a more timely fashion under the collection-year
format. Analyses comparing victimization estimates
based on collection year to those based on data year
show a very small difference in the estimates and the
majority of BJS publications use the collection-year
format. Consequently, BJS has decided to update
this report to include collection-year estimates for
the NCVS.

Appendix A: Technical Notes

Readers should note that in 2003, in accordance with
changes to the Office of Management and Budget’s
standards for the classification of federal data on race
and ethnicity, the NCVS item on race/ethnicity was
modified. A question on Hispanic origin is followed
by a question on race. The new question about race
allows the respondent to choose more than one race
and delineates Asian as a separate category from
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Analysis
conducted by the Demographic Surveys Division
at the U.S. Census Bureau showed that the new
question had very little impact on the aggregate racial
distribution of the NCVS respondents, with one
exception. There was a 1.6 percentage point decrease
in the percentage of respondents who reported
themselves as White. Due to changes in race/ethnicity
categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years
should be made with caution.
There were changes in the sample design and
survey methodology in the 2006 National Crime
Victimization Survey (NCVS) that may have affected
survey estimates. Caution should be used when
comparing 2006 estimates to other years. Data from
2007 onward are comparable to earlier years. Analyses
of the 2007 estimates indicate that the program
changes made in 2006 had relatively small effects on
NCVS changes. For more information on the 2006
NCVS data, see Criminal Victimization, 2006 at
http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv06.pdf,

pub/pdf/cv06tn.pdf, and Criminal Victimization,
2007 at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/
cv07.pdf.
The number of NCVS eligible households in sample
in 2010 was about 41,000. They were selected
using a stratified, multistage cluster design. In the
first stage, the primary sampling units (PSUs),
consisting of counties or groups of counties, were
selected. In the second stage, smaller areas, called
Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected from
each sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs,
clusters of four households, called segments, were
selected for interview. At each stage, the selection
was done proportionate to population size in order to
create a self-weighting sample. The final sample was
augmented to account for households constructed
after the decennial Census. Within each sampled
household, U.S. Census Bureau personnel attempts
to interview all household members age 12 and older
to determine whether they had been victimized by
the measured crimes during the 6 months preceding
the interview.
The first NCVS interview with a housing unit is
conducted in person. Subsequent interviews are

conducted by telephone, if possible. About 73,000
persons age 12 and older are interviewed each 6
months. Households remain in the sample for 3
years and are interviewed seven times at 6-month
intervals. Since the survey’s inception, the initial
interview at each sample unit has been used only to
bound future interviews to establish a time frame
to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered in these
subsequent interviews. Beginning in 2006, data from
the initial interview have been adjusted to account for
the effects of bounding and included in the survey
estimates. After their seventh interview, households
are replaced by new sample households. The NCVS
has consistently obtained a response rate of over 90
percent at the household level. The completion rates
for persons within households in 2010 were about 87
percent. Weights were developed to permit estimates
for the total U.S. population 12 years and older. For

Bureau of Justice Statistics
School Crime Supplement (SCS)
Created as a supplement to the NCVS and co
designed by the National Center for Education
Statistics and Bureau of Justice Statistics, the School
Crime Supplement (SCS) survey has been conducted
in 1989, 1995, and biennially since 1999 to collect
additional information about school-related victimizations on a national level. This report includes data
from the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, and
2009 collections. The 1989 data are not included in
this report as a result of methodological changes to
the NCVS and SCS. The SCS was designed to assist
policymakers, as well as academic researchers and
practitioners at federal, state, and local levels, to make
informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The
survey asks students a number of key questions about
their experiences with and perceptions of crime and
violence that occurred inside their school, on school
grounds, on the school bus, or on the way to or from
school. Students are asked additional questions about
security measures used by their school, students’
participation in after school activities, students’
perceptions of school rules, the presence of weapons
and gangs in school, the presence of hate-related
words and graffiti in school, student reports of
bullying and reports of rejection at school, and the
availability of drugs and alcohol in school. Students
are also asked attitudinal questions relating to fear
of victimization and avoidance behavior at school.

The SCS survey was conducted for a 6-month period
from January through June in all households selected
for the NCVS (see discussion above for information
about the NCVS sampling design and changes to the
race/ethnicity variable beginning in 2003. Within
these households, the eligible respondents for the SCS
were those household members who had attended
school at any time during the 6 months preceding
the interview, were enrolled in grades 6–12, and were
not home schooled. In 2007, the questionnaire was
changed and household members who attended school
sometime during the school year of the interview were
included. The age range of students covered in this
report is 12–18 years of age. Eligible respondents
were asked the supplemental questions in the SCS
only after completing their entire NCVS interview.
It should be noted that the first or unbounded NCVS
interview has always been included in analysis of the
SCS data and may result in the reporting of events
outside of the requested reference period.
The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999, 2001,
2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009 was calculated by using
NCVS incident variables appended to the SCS data
files of the same year. The NCVS type of crime
variable was used to classify victimizations of students
in the SCS as serious violent, violent, or theft. The
NCVS variables asking where the incident happened
(at school) and what the victim was doing when it
happened (attending school or on the way to or from
school) were used to ascertain whether the incident
happened at school. Only incidents that occurred
inside the United States are included.
In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modified
from previous collections. First, in 1995 and 1999, “at
school” was defined for respondents as in the school
building, on the school grounds, or on a school bus.
In 2001, the definition for “at school” was changed
to mean in the school building, on school property,
on a school bus, or going to and from school. This
change was made to the 2001 questionnaire in order
to be consistent with the definition of “at school” as it
is constructed in the NCVS and was also used as the
definition in subsequent SCS collections. Cognitive
interviews conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on
the 1999 SCS suggested that modifications to the
definition of “at school” would not have a substantial
impact on the estimates.
A total of 9,700 students participated in the 1995
SCS, 8,400 in 1999, about 8,400 in 2001, about 7,200
in 2003, about 6,300 in 2005, about 5,600 in 2007,
and 5,000 in 2009. In the 2009 SCS, the household
completion rate was 92 percent.

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2011

171

In the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007 SCS,
the household completion rates were 95 percent, 94
percent, 93 percent, 92 percent, 91 percent, and 90
percent respectively, and the student completion rates
were 78 percent, 78 percent, 77 percent, 70 percent,
62 percent, and 58 percent respectively. For the 2009
SCS, the student completion rate was 56 percent. The
overall unweighted SCS unit response rate (calculated
by multiplying the household completion rate by the
student completion rate) was 74 percent in 1995,
about 73 percent in 1999, about 72 percent in 2001,
about 64 percent in 2003, about 56 percent in 2005,
about 53 percent in 2007, and 51 percent in 2009.
There are two types of nonresponse: unit and
item nonresponse. NCES requires that any stage
of data collection within a survey that has a unit
base-weighted response rate of less than 85 percent
be evaluated for the potential magnitude of unit
nonresponse bias before the data or any analysis
using the data may be released (U.S. Department
of Education 2003). Due to the low unit response
rate in 2005, 2007, and 2009, a unit nonresponse
bias analysis was done. Unit response rates indicate
how many sampled units have completed interviews.
Because interviews with students could only be
completed after households had responded to the
NCVS, the unit completion rate for the SCS reflects
both the household interview completion rate and
the student interview completion rate. Nonresponse
can greatly affect the strength and application of
survey data by leading to an increase in variance as a
result of a reduction in the actual size of the sample
and can produce bias if the nonrespondents have
characteristics of interest that are different from the
respondents.
In order for response bias to occur, respondents
must have different response rates and responses to
particular survey variables. The magnitude of unit
nonresponse bias is determined by the response
rate and the differences between respondents and
nonrespondents on key survey variables. Although the
bias analysis cannot measure response bias since the
SCS is a sample survey and it is not known how the
population would have responded, the SCS sampling
frame has four key student or school characteristic
variables for which data is known for respondents
and nonrespondents: sex, race/ethnicity, household
income, and urbanicity, all of which are associated
with student victimization. To the extent that there
are differential responses by respondents in these
groups, nonresponse bias is a concern.
In 2005, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of bias for the race, household income, and
172

Appendix A: Technical Notes

urbanicity variables. White (non-Hispanic) and Other
(non-Hispanic) respondents had higher response
rates than Black (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic
respondents. Respondents from households with an
income of $35,000–$49,999 and $50,000 or more
had higher response rates than those from households
with incomes of less than $7,500, $7,500–$14,999,
$15,000–$24,999 and $25,000–$34,999. Respondents who live in urban areas had lower response
rates than those who live in rural or suburban areas.
Although the extent of nonresponse bias cannot be
determined, weighting adjustments, which corrected
for differential response rates, should have reduced
the problem.
In 2007, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of bias by the race/ethnicity and household
income variables. Hispanic respondents had lower
response rates than other race/ethnicities.
Respondents from households with an income of
$25,000 or more had higher response rates than those
from households with incomes of less than $25,000.
However, when responding students are compared to
the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable
differences between the responding students and the
eligible students, suggesting the nonresponse bias has
little impact on the overall estimates.
In 2009, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found
evidence of potential bias for the race/ethnicity and
urbanicity variables. White students and students of
other race/ethnicities had higher response rates than
did Black and Hispanic respondents. Respondents
from households located in rural areas had higher
response rates than those from households located in
urban areas. However, when responding students are
compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were
no measurable differences between the responding
students and the eligible students, suggesting the
nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall
estimates. All analyses for this report are conducted
with weighted survey data so that estimates are
representative of the population. Weighting the data
adjusts for unequal selection probabilities and for the
effects of nonresponse.
Response rates for most SCS survey items in all
survey years were high—typically over 97 percent
of all eligible respondents meaning there is little
potential for item nonresponse bias for most items in
the survey. Weights were developed to compensate for
differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse.
The weighted data permit inferences about the eligible
student population who were enrolled in schools in
all SCS data years.

Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)
The National School-Based Youth Risk Behavior
Survey (YRBS) is one component of the Youth
Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), an
epidemiological surveillance system developed by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
to monitor the prevalence of youth behaviors that
most influence health. The YRBS focuses on priority
health-risk behaviors established during youth that
result in the most significant mortality, morbidity,
disability, and social problems during both youth
and adulthood. This report uses 1993, 1995, 1997,
1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009 YRBS data.
The YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling
design to produce a nationally representative sample
of students in grades 9–12 in the United States.
The target population consisted of all public and
private school students in grades 9–12 in the 50
states and the District of Columbia. The first-stage
sampling frame included selecting primary sampling
units (PSUs) from strata formed on the basis of
urbanization and the relative percentage of Black
and Hispanic students in the PSU. These PSUs are
either counties; subareas of large counties; or groups
of smaller, adjacent counties. At the second stage,
schools were selected with probability proportional
to school enrollment size.
The final stage of sampling consisted of randomly
selecting, in each chosen school and in each of
grades 9–12, one or two classrooms from either a
required subject, such as English or social studies,
or a required period, such as homeroom or second
period. All students in selected classes were eligible to
participate. Three strategies were used to oversample
Black and Hispanic students: (1) larger sampling rates
were used to select PSUs that are in high-Black and
high-Hispanic strata; (2) a modified measure of size
was used that increased the probability of selecting
schools with a disproportionately high percentage of
combined Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or
American Indian/Alaska Native enrollment; and (3)
two classes per grade, rather than one, were selected
in schools with a high percentage of combined Black,

Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/
Alaska Native enrollment. Approximately 16,300
students participated in the 1993 survey, 10,900
students participated in the 1995 survey, 16,300
students participated in the 1997 survey, 15,300
students participated in the 1999 survey, 13,600
students participated in the 2001 survey, 15,200
students participated in the 2003 survey, 13,900
students participated in the 2005 survey, 14,000
students participated in the 2007 survey, and 16,400
students participated in the 2009 survey.
The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993
survey, 60 percent for the 1995 survey, 69 percent for
the 1997 survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey, 63
percent for the 2001 survey, 67 percent for the 2003
survey, 67 percent for the 2005 survey, 68 percent
for the 2007 survey, and 71 percent for the 2009
survey. NCES standards call for response rates of 85
percent or better for cross-sectional surveys, and bias
analyses are required by NCES when that percentage
is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full nonresponse
bias analysis has not been done because the data
necessary to do the analysis are not available. The
weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse and
the oversampling of Black and Hispanic students in
the sample. The final weights were constructed so that
only weighted proportions of students (not weighted
counts of students) in each grade matched national
population projections.
State-level data were downloaded from the Youth
Online: Comprehensive Results web page. Each state
and local school-based YRBS employs a two-stage,
cluster sample design to produce representative samples
of students in grades 9–12 in their jurisdiction. All
except a few state and local samples include only
public schools, and each local sample includes only
schools in the funded school district (e.g., San Diego
Unified School District) rather than in the entire city
(e.g., greater San Diego area).
In the first sampling stage in all except a few states
and districts, schools are selected with probability
proportional to school enrollment size. In the second
sampling stage, intact classes of a required subject
or intact classes during a required period (e.g.,
second period) are selected randomly. All students
in sampled classes are eligible to participate. Certain
states and districts modify these procedures to meet
their individual needs. For example, in a given
state or district, all schools, rather than a sample
of schools, might be selected to participate. State
and local surveys that have a scientifically selected
sample, appropriate documentation, and an overall
response rate greater than or equal to 60 percent are
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2011

173

weighted. The overall response rate reflects the school
response rate multiplied by the student response rate.
These three criteria are used to ensure that the data
from those surveys can be considered representative
of students in grades 9–12 in that jurisdiction. A
weight is applied to each record to adjust for student
nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade,
sex, and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore,
weighted estimates are representative of all students
in grades 9–12 attending schools in each jurisdiction.
Surveys that do not have an overall response rate of
greater than or equal to 60 percent and that do not
have appropriate documentation are not weighted and
are not included in this report.
In 2009, a total of 42 states and 20 districts had
weighted data. Not all of the districts were contained
in the 42 states. For example, California was not
one of the 42 states that obtained weighted data
but it contained several districts that did. For more
information on the location of the districts please see
http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/participation.
htm. In sites with weighted data, the student sample
sizes for the state and local YRBS ranged from 965
to 14,870. School response rates ranged from 73 to
100 percent, student response rates ranged from 61
to 90 percent, and overall response rates ranged from
60 to 94 percent.
Readers should note that reports of these data
published by the CDC and in this report do not
include percentages where the denominator includes
less than 100 unweighted cases.
In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office
of Management and Budget’s standards for the
classification of federal data on race and ethnicity,
the YRBS item on race/ethnicity was modified. The
version of the race and ethnicity question used in
1993, 1995, and 1997 was:
How do you describe yourself?
a.	
White—not Hispanic

In the 2005 national survey and in all 2007 and
2009 surveys, race/ethnicity was computed from two
questions: (1) “Are you Hispanic or Latino?” (response
options were “yes” and “no”), and (2) “What is your
race?” (response options were “American Indian or
Alaska Native,” “Asian,” “Black or African American,”
“Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,” or
“White”). For the second question, students could
select more than one response option. For this
report, students were classified as “Hispanic” if they
answered “yes” to the first question, regardless of
how they answered the second question. Students
who answered “no” to the first question and selected
more than one race/ethnicity in the second category
were classified as “More than one race.” Students
who answered “no” to the first question and selected
only one race/ethnicity were classified as that race/
ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was classified as missing for
students who did not answer the first question and
for students who answered “no” to the first question
but did not answer the second question.
CDC has conducted two studies to understand the
effect of changing the race/ethnicity item on the
YRBS. Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found
that allowing students to select more than one
response to a single race/ethnicity question on the
YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/
ethnicity among high school students. Eaton, Brener,
Kann, and Pittman (2007) found that self-reported
race/ethnicity was similar regardless of whether the
single-question or a two-question format was used.

Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS)
This report draws upon data on teacher victimization
from the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS),
which provides national- and state-level data on
public schools and national- and affiliation-level
data on private schools. The 1993–94, 1999–2000,
2003–04, and 2007–08 SASS were collected by the
U.S. Census Bureau and sponsored by the National
Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The
1993–94, 1999–2000, and 2003–04 administrations
of SASS consisted of four sets of linked surveys,
including surveys of schools, the principals of each
selected school, a subsample of teachers within each
school, and public school districts. The 2007–08
administration of SASS consisted of five types of
questionnaires: district questionnaires, principal
questionnaires, school questionnaires, teacher
questionnaires, and school library media center
questionnaires. In 1993–94, there were two sets of
teacher surveys, public and private school teachers. In
1999–2000, there were four sets of teacher surveys,
public, private, public charter, and Bureau of Indian
Education (BIE) school teachers. In 2003–04 and
2007–08, there were three sets of teacher surveys,
public (including public charter), private, and BIE.
For this report, BIE and public charter schools are
included with public schools.
The public school sampling frames for the 1993–94,
1999–2000, 2003–04, and 2007–08 SASS were
created using the 1991–92, 1997–98, 2001–02, and
2005–06 NCES Common Core of Data (CCD)
Public School Universe Files, respectively. In SASS,
a school was defined as an institution or part of
an institution that provides classroom instruction
to students; has one or more teachers to provide
instruction; serves students in one or more of grades
1–12 or the ungraded equivalent and is located in one
or more buildings apart from a private home. It was
possible for two or more schools to share the same
building; in this case they were treated as different
schools if they had different administrations (i.e.,
principals or school head). Since CCD and SASS
differ in scope and their definition of a school, some
records were deleted, added, or modified in order to
provide better coverage and a more efficient sample
design for SASS. Data were collected by multistage
sampling, which began with the selection of schools.
This report uses 1993–94, 1999–2000, 2003–04,
and 2007–08 SASS data. Approximately 10,000
public schools and 3,300 private schools were selected
to participate in the 1993–94 SASS, 11,100 public
schools (9,900 public schools, 100 BIE-funded
schools, and 1,100 charter schools) and 3,600
private schools were selected to participate in the

1999–2000 SASS, 10,400 public schools (10,200
public schools and 200 BIE-funded schools) and
3,600 private schools were selected to participate in
the 2003–04 SASS, and 9,980 public schools (9,800
public schools and 180 BIE-funded schools) and
2,940 private schools were selected to participate in
the 2007–08 SASS. Within each school, teachers
selected were further stratified into one of five teacher
types in the following hierarchy: (1) Asian or Pacific
Islander; (2) American Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; (3)
teachers who teach classes designed for students with
limited English proficiency; (4) teachers in their first,
second, or third year of teaching; and (5) teachers not
classified in any of the other groups. Within each
teacher stratum, teachers were selected systematically
with equal probability. In 1993–94, approximately
57,000 public school teachers and 11,500 private
school teachers were sampled. In 1999– 2000, about
56,300 public school teachers, 500 BIE teachers,
4,400 public charter school teachers, and 10,800
private school teachers were sampled. In 2003–04,
about 52,500 public school teachers, 700 BIE
teachers, and 10,000 private school teachers were
sampled. In 2007–08, about 47,440 public school
teachers, 750 BIE teachers, and 8,180 private school
teachers were sampled.
This report focuses on responses from teachers. The
overall weighted response rate for public school
teachers in 1993–94 was 88 percent. In 1999–2000,
the overall weighted response rates were 77 percent for
public school teachers, and 86 and 72 percent for BIE
and public charter school teachers, respectively (which
are included with public school teachers for this
report). In 2003–04, the overall weighted response
rates were 76 percent for public school teachers and
86 percent for BIE-funded school teachers (who are
included with public school teachers). In 2007–08,
the overall weighted response rates were 72 percent for
public school teachers and 71 percent for BIE-funded
school teachers (who are included with public school
teachers). For private school teachers, the overall
weighted response rates were 80 percent in 1993–94,
about 67 percent in 1999–2000, about 70 percent in
2003–04, and 66 percent in 2007–08. Values were
imputed for questionnaire items that should have been
answered but were not. For additional information

School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)
The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)
is managed by the National Center for Education
Statistics (NCES) on behalf of the U.S. Department
of Education. SSOCS collects extensive crime and
safety data from principals and school administrators
of U.S. public schools. Data from this collection can
be used to examine the relationship between school
characteristics and violent and serious violent crimes
in primary schools, middle schools, high schools, and
combined schools. In addition, data from SSOCS can
be used to assess what crime prevention programs,
practices, and policies are used by schools. SSOCS
has been conducted in school years 1999–2000,
2003–04, 2005–06, 2007–08, and 2009–10. A sixth
collection is planned for school year 2011–12.
SSOCS was developed by NCES and is funded by
the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools of the U.S.
Department of Education. The 2009–10 SSOCS
(SSOCS:2010) was conducted by the U.S. Census
Bureau. Data collection began on February 24, 2010,
when questionnaire packets were mailed to sampled
schools, and continued through June 11, 2010. A total
of 2,648 public schools submitted usable questionnaires: 684 primary schools, 909 middle schools, 948
high schools, and 107 combined schools.
The sampling frame for SSOCS:2010 was constructed
from the 2007–08 Public Elementary/Secondary
School Universe data file of the Common Core
of Data (CCD), an annual collection of data on
all public K–12 schools and school districts. The
SSOCS sampling frame was restricted to regular
public schools in the United States and the District
of Columbia (including charter schools).
A total of 3,476 schools were selected for the 2010
study. In February 2010, questionnaires were mailed
to school principals, who were asked to complete the
survey or to have it completed by the person most
knowledgeable about discipline issues at the school.
A total of 2,648 schools completed the survey. The
weighted overall response rate was 80.8 percent.1 A
nonresponse bias analysis was conducted on the 3
items with weighted item nonresponse rates below 85
percent. The detected bias was not deemed problematic enough to suppress any items from the data file.
Weights were developed to adjust for the variable
probabilities of selection and differential nonresponse
and can be used to produce national estimates for
regular public schools in the 2009–10 school year. For
1

  The weighted response rate is calculated by applying the
base sampling rates to the following ratio: completed cases/
(total sample—known ineligibles).

Accuracy of Estimates
The accuracy of any statistic is determined by the joint
effects of nonsampling and sampling errors. Both
types of error affect the estimates presented in this
report. Several sources can contribute to nonsampling
errors. For example, members of the population of
interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling
frame; sampled members refuse to answer some of
the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of
the survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse);
mistakes are made during data editing, coding,
or entry; the responses that respondents provide
differ from the “true” responses; or measurement
instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail
to measure the characteristics they are intended
to measure. Although nonsampling errors due to
questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced
somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and
imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling
errors or gauging the effects of these errors is usually
difficult.
Sampling errors occur because observations are
made on samples rather than on entire populations.
Surveys of population universes are not subject
to sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample
will differ somewhat from those that would have
been obtained by a complete census of the relevant
population using the same survey instruments,
instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a
statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling;
it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in
a particular sample. In addition, the standard errors
for two sample statistics can be used to estimate the
precision of the difference between the two statistics
and to help determine whether the difference based
on the sample is large enough so that it represents the
population difference.
Most of the data used in this report were obtained
from complex sampling designs rather than a simple
random design. The features of complex sampling

require different techniques to calculate standard
errors than are used for data collected using a simple
random sampling. Therefore, calculation of standard
errors requires procedures that are markedly different
from the ones used when the data are from a simple
random sample. The Taylor series approximation
technique or the balanced repeated replication (BRR)
method was used to estimate most of the statistics
and their standard errors in this report.
Standard error calculation for data from the School
Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series
approximation method using PSU and strata variables
available from each dataset. For statistics based on
all years of NCVS data, standard errors were derived
from a formula developed by the U.S. Census Bureau,
which consists of three generalized variance function
(gvf) constant parameters that represent the curve
fitted to the individual standard errors calculated
using the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique.
The coefficient of variation (CV ) represents the ratio
of the standard error to the mean. As an attribute
of a distribution, the CV is an important measure of
the reliability and accuracy of an estimate. In this
report, the CV was calculated for all estimates, and
in cases where the CV was at least 30 percent the
estimates were noted with a ! symbol (interpret data
with caution). In cases where the CV was greater than
50 percent, the estimate was determined not to meet
reporting standards and was suppressed.

Statistical Procedures
The comparisons in the text have been tested for
statistical significance to ensure that the differences
are larger than might be expected due to sampling
variation. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited
in the report are statistically significant at the .05
level. Several test procedures were used, depending
upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature
of the statement being tested. The primary test
procedure used in this report was Student’s t statistic,
which tests the difference between two sample
estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for
multiple comparisons. The formula used to compute
the t statistic is as follows:

t=

E1 - E2
√se12 + se 22

(1)

where E1 and E2 are the estimates to be compared
and se1 and se2 are their corresponding standard
errors. Note that this formula is valid only for
independent estimates. When the estimates are not
independent (for example, when comparing a total
percentage with that for a subgroup included in the

total), a covariance term (i.e., 2 * r * se1 * se2) must
be subtracted from the denominator of the formula:

t=

E1 - E2
√se12 + se 22 - (2 * r * se1 * se2)

(2)

where r is the correlation coefficient. Once the t value
was computed, it was compared to the published
tables of values at certain critical levels, called
alpha levels. For this report, an alpha value of .05
was used, which has a t value of 1.96. If the t value
was larger than 1.96, then the difference between
the two estimates is statistically significant at the
95 percent level.
A linear trend test was used when differences among
percentages were examined relative to ordered
categories of a variable, rather than the differences
between two discrete categories. This test allows one
to examine whether, for example, the percentage of
students using drugs increased (or decreased) over
time or whether the percentage of students who
reported being physically attacked in school increased
(or decreased) with their age. Based on a regression
with, for example, student’s age as the independent
variable and whether a student was physically attacked
as the dependent variable, the test involves computing
the regression coefficient (b and its corresponding
standard error se). The ratio of these two (b/se) is the
test statistic t. If t is greater than 1.96, the critical
value for one comparison at the .05 alpha level, the
hypothesis that there is no linear relationship between
student’s age and being physically attacked is rejected.
Some comparisons among categories of an ordered
variable with three or more levels involved a test for a
linear trend across all categories, rather than a series
of tests between pairs of categories. In this report,
when differences among percentages were examined
relative to a variable with ordered categories, analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear
relationship between the two variables. To do this,
ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts
corresponding to successive levels of the independent
variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors
(that is, standard errors that were calculated by the
Taylor series method), the variance between the
means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used
to partition the total sum of squares into within- and
between-group sums of squares. These were used to
create mean squares for the within- and betweengroup variance components and their corresponding
F statistics, which were then compared to published
values of F for a significance level of .05. Significant
values of both the overall F and the F associated with
the linear contrast term were required as evidence of
a linear relationship between the two variables.

Appendix B:
Glossary of
Terms

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2011

179

General Terms
Crime Any violation of a statute or regulation or any
act that the government has determined is injurious
to the public, including felonies and misdemeanors.
Such violation may or may not involve violence, and
it may affect individuals or property.
Incident A specific criminal act or offense involving
one or more victims and one or more offenders.
Multistage sampling A survey sampling technique in
which there is more than one wave of sampling. That
is, one sample of units is drawn, and then another
sample is drawn within that sample. For example,
at the first stage, a number of Census blocks may be
sampled out of all the Census blocks in the United
States. At the second stage, households are sampled
within the previously sampled Census blocks.
Prevalence The percentage of the population directly
affected by crime in a given period. This rate is based
upon specific information elicited directly from the
respondent regarding crimes committed against his
or her person, against his or her property, or against
an individual bearing a unique relationship to him
or her. It is not based upon perceptions and beliefs
about, or reactions to, criminal acts.
School An education institution consisting of one or
more of grades K through 12.
School crime Any criminal activity that is committed
on school property.
School year The 12-month period of time denoting
the beginning and ending dates for school accounting purposes, usually from July 1 through June 30.
Stratification A survey sampling technique in
which the target population is divided into mutually
exclusive groups or strata based on some variable or
variables (e.g., metropolitan area) and sampling of
units occurs separately within each stratum.
Unequal probabilities A survey sampling technique
in which sampled units do not have the same probability of selection into the sample. For example, the
investigator may oversample rural students in order
to increase the sample sizes of rural students. Rural
students would then be more likely than other students to be sampled.

Specific Terms Used in Various Surveys
School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study
(SAVD)
Homicide An act involving a killing of one person by
another resulting from interpersonal violence.
School-associated violent death A homicide or
suicide in which the fatal injury occurred on the
180

Appendix B: Glossary of Terms

campus of a functioning elementary or secondary
school in the United States, while the victim was on
the way to or from regular sessions at such a school, or
while the victim was attending or traveling to or from
an official school-sponsored event. Victims included
nonstudents as well as students and staff members.
Suicide An act of taking one’s own life voluntarily
and intentionally.
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
Aggravated assault Attack or attempted attack with
a weapon, regardless of whether or not an injury
occurs, and attack without a weapon when serious
injury results.
At school (students) Inside the school building, on
school property (school parking area, play area, school
bus, etc.), or on the way to or from school.
Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) Geographic
entities defined by the U.S. Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for use by federal statistical
agencies in collecting, tabulating, and publishing
federal statistics.
Rape Forced sexual intercourse including both
psychological coercion as well as physical force.
Forced sexual intercourse means vaginal, anal, or
oral penetration by the offender(s). Includes attempts
and verbal threats of rape. This category also includes
incidents where the penetration is from a foreign
object, such as a bottle.
Robbery Completed or attempted theft, directly
from a person, of property or cash by force or threat
of force, with or without a weapon, and with or
without injury.
Serious violent victimization Rape, sexual assault,
robbery, or aggravated assault.
Sexual assault A wide range of victimizations,
separate from rape or attempted rape. These crimes
include attacks or attempted attacks generally involving unwanted sexual contact between the victim and
offender. Sexual assault may or may not involve force
and includes such things as grabbing or fondling.
Sexual assault also includes verbal threats.
Simple assault Attack without a weapon resulting
either in no injury, minor injury, or an undetermined
injury requiring less than 2 days of hospitalization.
Also includes attempted assault without a weapon.
Theft Completed or attempted theft of property or
cash without personal contact.
Victimization A crime as it affects one individual
person or household. For personal crimes, the number
of victimizations is equal to the number of victims involved. The number of victimizations may be greater

than the number of incidents because more than one
person may be victimized during an incident.
Victimization rate A measure of the occurrence of
victimizations among a specific population group. For
personal crimes, the number of victimizations is equal
to the number of victims involved. Each victimization that is reported by the respondents is counted,
so there may be one incident with two victims, which
would be counted as two victimizations. The number
of victimizations may be greater than the number
of incidents because more than one person may be
victimized during an incident.

any victimization. If the student reported having
experienced both, he or she is counted once under
“total victimization.”
Violent victimization Includes serious violent victimization, rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated
assault, or simple assault.
Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)
Illegal drugs Examples of illegal drugs were marijuana, cocaine, inhalants, steroids, or prescription
drugs without a doctor’s permission, heroin, and
methamphetamines.

Violent victimization Includes serious violent
victimization, rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated
assault, or simple assault.

On school property On school property is included
in the question wording, but was not defined for
respondents.

School Crime Supplement (SCS)

Rural school A school located outside a Metropolitan
Statistical Area (MSA).

At school In the school building, on school property,
on a school bus, or going to or from school.
Bullied Students were asked if any student had
bullied them at school in one or more ways during
the school year. Specifically, students were asked if
another student had made fun of them, called them
names, or insulted them; spread rumors about them;
threatened them with harm; pushed, shoved, tripped,
or spit on them; forced them to do something they
did not want to do; excluded them from activities
on purpose; or destroyed their property on purpose.
Cyber-bullied Students were asked if another student
did one or more of the following behaviors anywhere
that made them feel bad or were hurtful. Specifically,
students were asked about bullying by a peer that occurred anywhere via electronic means, including the
Internet, e-mail, instant messaging, text messaging,
online gaming, and online communities.
Gang Street gangs, fighting gangs, crews, or something else. Gangs may use common names, signs,
symbols, or colors. All gangs, whether or not they
are involved in violent or illegal activity, are included.
Hate-related graffiti Hate-related words or symbols
written in school classrooms, school bathrooms,
school hallways, or on the outside of the school
building.
Hate-related words Students were asked if anyone
called them an insulting or bad name at school having
to do with their race, religion, ethnic background
or national origin, disability, gender, or sexual
orientation.
Serious violent victimization Rape, sexual assault,
robbery, or aggravated assault.
Total victimization Combination of violent victimization and theft. If a student reported an incident of
either type, he or she is counted as having experienced

Suburban school A school located inside an MSA,
but outside the “central city.”
Urban school A school located inside an MSA and
inside the “central city.”
Weapon Examples of weapons appearing in the
questionnaire include guns, knives, and clubs.
Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS)
City A territory inside an urbanized area (defined as
densely settled “cores” with populations of 50,000 or
more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely
settled surrounding areas) and inside a principal
city (defined as a city that contains the primary
population and economic center of a metropolitan
statistical area, which, in turn, is defined as one or
more contiguous counties that have a “core” area with
a large population nucleus and adjacent communities
that are highly integrated economically or socially
with the core).
Elementary school A school in which the lowest
grade is less than or equal to grade 6 and the highest
grade is less than or equal to grade 8.
Elementary school teachers An elementary school
teacher is one who, when asked for the grades taught,
checked: (1) only “ungraded” and was designated as
an elementary teacher on the list of teachers provided
by the school; (2) 6th grade or lower or “ungraded,”
and no grade higher than 6th; (3) 6th grade or lower
and 7th grade or higher, and reported a primary
assignment of prekindergarten, kindergarten, or
general elementary; (4) 7th and 8th grades only, and
reported a primary assignment of prekindergarten,
kindergarten, or general elementary; (5) 6th grade or
lower and 7th grade or higher, and reported a primary
assignment of special education and was designated as
an elementary teacher on the list of teachers provided

by the school; or (6) 7th and 8th grades only, and
reported a primary assignment of special education
and was designated as an elementary teacher on the
list of teachers provided by the school. A teacher
at a school that has grade 6 or lower or one that is
“ungraded” with no grade higher than the 8th.
Instructional level Instructional levels divide
teachers into elementary or secondary based on a
combination of the grades taught, main teaching
assignment, and the structure of the teacher’s class(es).
Those with only ungraded classes are categorized as
elementary level teachers if their main assignment
is early childhood/prekindergarten or elementary,
or they teach either special education in a selfcontained classroom or an elementary enrichment
class. All other teachers with ungraded classes are
classified as secondary level. Among teachers with
regularly graded classes, in general, elementary level
teachers teach any of grades prekindergarten through
5th; report an early childhood/prekindergarten,
elementary, self-contained special education, or
elementary enrichment main assignment; or are
