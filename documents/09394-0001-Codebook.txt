     SUMMARY: This supplement to the National Crime Surveys was designed       
     to  collect  data  on  crime victimization in schools in the United       
     States.  Student respondents were asked a series  of  questions  to       
     determine  their  school  attendance  in the last six months. Other       
     questions concerning schools were posed, including type of  school,       
     distance from home, and general attendance and monitoring policies.       
     The data present information on  the  response  of  the  school  to       
     student violation of rules, accessibility of drugs, and violence in       
     school, including types of violence  and  student  reaction.  Other
