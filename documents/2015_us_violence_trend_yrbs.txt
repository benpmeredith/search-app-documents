National YRBS: 1991—2015
***

The national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) monitors priority health risk behaviors that contribute to the
leading causes of death, disability, and social problems among youth and adults in the United States. The
national YRBS is conducted every two years during the spring semester and provides data representative of
9th through 12th grade students in public and private schools throughout the United States.
