Indicator 3Prevalence of Victimization at SchoolIn 2013, approximately 3 percent of students ages 12   18 reported being victimized at school during the previous 6 months. Two percent of students reported theft, 1 percent reported violent victimization, and less than one-half of 1 percent reported serious violent victimization.
